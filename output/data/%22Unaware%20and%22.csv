&gt;Words and ideas mean things. If someone tells you they are going to burn down your house, and draws comics about burning down houses, and writes about how cool burning down houses are, do you just wait till your house is burnt down to be like ""hey, that guy wants to burn down my house!""

Thats true but what you linked is not that.

What we have the first one is somthing called cashing in on a trend.

First comic is pointing out the hypocrisy and lack of self awareness of one radical being mad at another radical.

2nd comic: satire of the power rangers. Jokes about colours and relating them to race has been around since they first started.

3rd: i dont quiite know the context. If i had to guess its the rights/conservative view of an enlightened centrist. Its got the horseshoe referencing the horseshoe  theory probably.


So none of those examples are calls to action and if you think they are i want you to explain why.

All that is to be seen are comics that mock ideas and people.

Not too mention these are just the comics where are the references from the man himself that line up with his comics.


These arent some impossible goal posts. What are your references for thinking these comics are nazi material? Because to me it seems like a bunch of people call him and his comics nazi due to either personal distaste or feel they are one of the people being mocked and thus are emotionally blinded.

"hqfu6ag","I got a $50 ticket (permit parking violation - I had no permit, or guest pass, or any idea that cities did that. Dumb naive suburban kid) when I first looked at a Somerville apartment way back in the summer of 2019. I was able to successfully get that ticket waived, but only because I was going to get a parking permit and I talked to one of the people there that does the ticket appeals. She was nice and understanding and said if I was getting a permit today she would waive my ticket. She was very clear this was a 1 time only thing and that it was a valid ticket. I just explained I was unaware and new to the City. I've found this to be the case with other cities too - you can ask nicely and get tickets waived the first time. Sometimes pleading ignorance helps. People are understanding that the first time you might fuck up and not read the signs posted on the street.

Unfortunately I think you're SOL with how many tickets you've racked up. You might try asking them nicely about it, maybe they'd waive one or two tickets to bring the cost down. You could also ask if it's possible to get a permit while still paying off the tickets. Maybe they have a payment plan or something you can work out. I'm not quite certain - this is definitely a question to ask the parking department about. All we can do is guess.

My best guess - you get one or two tickets waived. They probably let you buy a permit if you've successfully garaged your car here. That way you avoid getting new tickets. You'll probably have to pay some amount of those tickets back though. I doubt they're nice enough to waive $300 in tickets. Especially if you were ""too lazy"". Try wording that differently too as a pro tip - you weren't *lazy*, you were *busy*. Don't be a dick about that either, just leave it at ""busy"".

"hqfm8dr","Born in the last week of 96, my memories begin around 2001. Earlier in my life my biological dad left my family and my mom was a single mom to me for a few years. I have no memory of this time or my biological dad.

2001- B. My mom was engaged to the man who would legally adopt me. to this day I have mixed feelings about that, I’m half black and I had to convert to judaism when he adopted me, and I never fit into that religion very well. However I remember enjoying their wedding (first party I can remember, formed strong core memories here) and I was the flower girl.

2002- A+. All I ever wanted was a sibling, and my little sister was born this year. I was so excited to have a new best friend, and had SO much fun with her as a baby (I was 5). She was born the second week of January so the entire year was marked by her coming into the world.

2003- A. Still super happy about having a sibling, and we went to Disneyland for the first time. Disneyland is still one of my favorite places to visit. 

2004- B. My second sister was born, and for some reason I was less thrilled about this. I wanted a brother pretty badly, and I knew with two sisters the three of us would always be “the girls”, and I had began realizing that I didn’t exactly feel like a girl. Still had a fun time being a child and I really loved computer games and video games at the time. Played a LOT of pajama sam and game boy.

2005- C. Started being bullied in school around this time. I became very aware of the things that made me different. My sisters were white and so were my parents, I was obviously half black. This wasn’t as common then as it is now, and people asked me everyday why I was different. I also began having a bad relationship with my adopted dad, and was beginning to struggling intensely with my perceived gender. I’m sure I had some good memories, but this period of my life was really hard. 

2006- C. Pretty similar to the above, but my family forced me to join dance team and I hated it SO much.

2007- D. Started puberty this year, and was MORTIFIED. I was in extreme denial that I was beginning to develop those parts. My mom would frequently yell at me in public stores that I was “becoming a woman” and would force me to try on bras. Yeah I hated this time of my life a lot. The only redeeming thing was the music, I had recently gotten an ipod and I spent so much time listening to music. I’m really nostalgic for music from this period because it helped me get through a lot.

2008- C. More terrible puberty stuff, iykyk. Started middle school. My parents put me in a private middle school for kids who were more artistic (and bullied in public schools) so that helped a lot. Was able to make my first LGBT friends, though nobody came out until many years later. But was deeply uncomfortable with my body and started SH around this age. My mom also had a really terrible alcohol problem which would persist until she went to rehab in 2012.

2009- B+. Was forced to have a Bat Mitzvah, which was pretty ridiculous. I had no choice despite not being born Jewish, and was forced into an ugly dress. The photos are so bad lol. But the music was awesome and Glee had recently started, which I was obsessed with. It had so much queer representation and made me feel more hopeful for my future.


2010- A-. Felt like I really had some solid friends, went on the 8th grade trip to disneyland, made my first film (a documentary about my sisters 1st grade class, really wish I still had it.) My love of film and interest in the entertainment industry began here. Had a lot of energy and was genuinely happy, despite still hating my body.

2011- C. Left the private middle school for a public high school due to financial reasons (couldn’t afford the private high school attached to it), and was brought back down to my low status I had in elementary school. Was making youtube videos at the time, but stopped before 2012 because of bullying. My parents forced me to join speech and debate and I hated it. My moms drinking was really bad. My sisters were young and unaware and to this day I struggle to relate to them because they weren’t old enough to really remember how bad my moms drinking was. 

2012- F. My mom nearly died from alcohol and then went to rehab. I became extremely depressed and fought constantly with both of my parents, and SH a lot. My only refuge was gay tumblr, but I still had imposter syndrome and thought I couldn’t be gay or trans. Turned 16 at the end of the year and was “surprised” with the ugliest car in the world.

2013- D. Still not in a good mental place. Didn’t have any solid friends. Realized I needed to throw myself into school so that I could get a scholarship to go out of state. Everyone told me I couldn’t do it, so I proved them wrong.

2014- B+. Started applying to colleges and was SO prepared. I got a 33 on my ACT and had above a 4.0. Got into every college I applied to, decided to go to the University of Wisconsin on a full tuition scholarship. Was SO FUCKING HAPPY to leave my hometown (on the other side of the country) and finally be my own person. 

2015- A. Left for Madison in August and cried tears of joy. My hometown and family wouldn’t be around to make me feel bad anymore. I made friends so quickly in college with so many different people, and I joined a sorority just for shits (even though I hardly identified or looked like a girl at the time, I was able to find an actually decent sorority with nice ish people). 

2016- A (first half) F (second half). It was great for a while, and the music was the best. But I was sexually assaulted in the summer. My sorority wasn’t there for me. I retreated into my shell. I had to move into the sorority house after summer and it was a much different experience, I only had one friend and I knew I had to drop out otherwise I would lose the rest of my college experience.

2017- B. Left the sorority, had to figure out how I would define myself without it. Still didn’t know who I was, I had repressed my sexuality and gender a lot. I was perceived as a bro-y straight girl who could hang with the boys. In November I cut my hair pretty short, not a true boy haircut but close, and prepared to go abroad.

2018- A++ (one of the best years of my life easily). On January 3rd I left America to study abroad in London. This is the single handed best thing I ever could have done for myself. When I got to London I said fuck it, I’m going to kiss girls here (lol). I didn’t know anybody so it was easy to be myself. I was able to actually experience dating people who weren’t men. It felt so much more correct. I had an amazing internship abroad and I traveled to 20 countries and felt so happy and free. When I came back to America I pretty much instantly went to LA for a summer internship. I was able to meet more girls on Tinder and felt more confident in letting people know I wasn’t attracted to men. When I went back to wisconsin in the fall I started dating girls and felt so powerful lmao. I was super confident and loved the person I was becoming. A+ year for sure.

2019- A+. Met my partner and instantly fell in love no lie. Still together to this day. They ID’d as nonbinary and I thought that was amazing, and very relatable. I was able to talk about my own gender stuff with them and felt so seen and understood. They’re also mixed race and adopted like me so we understand each other on a really deep level. I graduated this yeare and they were going into their junior year, so I moved to chicago for a 2 year advertising grad school program so that we would be close enough to stay together. 

2020- A. Despite what happened with Covid, this year was honestly great for me. My school went 100% remote, so I broke my chicago lease and moved back to Madison to be with my partner. All of my college friends were a year or two younger than me (after leaving the sorority I became better friends with the kids in my orgs) so it was great being able to be back on campus with them again. Became closer to my partner, adopted a kitten and moved to Portland at the end of the year with them. 

2021- A. 2021 was this year and it was pretty great. I was hired at a really solid company in a field related to my interests and abilities where I can make great money (I’m an art director for a big advertising agency). I moved to Long Beach and love it here, I can skateboard every day. I got top surgery last month, which has improved my life in every single way and I’ll never stop being thankful to have been in a place financially and mentally to be able to give myself that gift. My partner is beginning a tattoo apprenticeship and I got like 10 more tattoos this year (hoping for way more next year). My relationship with the family I grew up with isn’t the best but I honestly don’t care at this point. They did a lot of harm raising me with no contact to my Black relatives or any Black positive influences, and I had to unlearn a lot of their bullshit and shame they put on me. But I have my own family with my partner and our cat and I have close friends nearby who moved here after college. 

I turned 25 on the 25th of December and I am honestly really happy to be past my earlier years. People fear this age because it kinda marks you as no longer a super young adult, but I feel like my life is just beginning. I’m making the most money I ever have, I can afford to do fun things, I still look super young, I’m in great shape, and I’m not planning on ever having children so I’m purely making money for my partner and I to travel the world and have a great life.

"hqbl01z","Like most luxury goods there is a range in what people are looking for, what they consider reasonable and worthy, etc when making a purchase. Some enthusiasts are more focused on aesthetics and brand recognition out of a desire to signal membership to a particular lifestyle. Others are more focused on the customer service and hospitality of a brand. And others are dedicated purely to the olfactory experience. Of course most are looking for the optimal combination of all 3 where luxury is concerned.  
Even within the subsection of olfactory experience, for example, there are quite a few considerations.   
Are there candles with enormous throw and longevity, that are more affordable? Absolutely. But just like in perfumery loud and brash doesn’t always equate with quality. And so there are individuals that don’t mind paying for perfumes with less sillage and longevity, in exchange for quality and artistic experience, and the same can be said for candle consumers. But on the other hand, it is our right as consumers to question the quality of the companies we give our money to and assure that we are getting our money’s worth from their products.  
Trudon is my favorite luxury brand. I never considered that I would ever spend this amount of money on a candle and to be honest I’m still amused by it on some days. But no other brand has come close (in my opinion) to being able to craft such unique olfactory experiences. I tried in the earlier days to find dupes of candles like solis rex or carmelite, which were some of my favorites, in an effort cut costs and expand my awareness of other brands. Although their aesthetics are well crafted, I was not beholden to the idea of brand recognition and their customer service didn’t seem particularly stellar especially in comparison to service pros like Diptyque. Even when I was ‘disappointed’ by a candle, I always grew to appreciate it just for the sheer craftsmanship. And that is a rare quality in a candle. Candles that I dislike, I can sell off or give away. But with Trudon, I don’t mind keeping the odd candle that I’m not absolutely fond of out of appreciation for the artistry. So if one day a candle company comes along, offering the same quality of trudon at cheaper prices, I will most definitely give them my patronage. But until then, they can retain their my portion of their market share.  
I recently tried my hand at Diptyqe, for example, as I was always impressed by stories of their fantastic customer service, complete with favorite sales assistants and generous samples. I was quite disappointed in their offerings however. And while I can appreciate the brand as a whole when it comes to their branding, marketing, service, etc. I accepted that it was not for me.   
Mind you there are many affordable candles that can provide you with exactly what you might be looking for, and not everyone is going to be as particular about their scents, nor require the same standards. In fact, I sometimes wish I could return to the days of blissful olfactory ignorance and enjoy some cheaper scents in peace! Alas what has been smelled cannot be unsmelled in any case, though there are many other areas in life of which I remain blissfully unaware and uncultured (my wallet rejoices!). But there are also cheaper candles that I enjoy, and some I still hang on to by their dying dregs for some reason or other (not being able to find the company for example).   
So I don’t know what you should be looking for in a candle, only you can know that. Don’t look for me or others on this board to tell you how to feel or think about a particular candle or brand.  The beauty of a board is that us enthusiasts can come together to discuss our hobbies and passions knowing we are in the company of those similarly inclined and knowledgeable. And for beginners it can be a guidebook and source of information. But it can also be detrimental for those still forming an opinion, as they can feel discouraged or inadequate for not seeing the value in a particular brand. With this in mind, I encourage you to continue your journey! Take your time, mind your finances, and use the resources provided here as a guide but never the final arbiter of your personal taste.",1640723605,"alas what has been smelled cannot be unsmelled in any case, though there are many other areas in life of which i remain blissfully unaware and uncultured (my wallet rejoices!).","unaware and uncultured","unaware","and",FALSE,"blissfully unaware and uncultured","uncultured","blissfully",NA,1

"hq9rnnj","Yours is also a rather disingenuous counterargument. Rape is rape whether or not the person is affected by it. If someone had sex with comatose person but the comatose person was completely unaware and unaffected by it, it's still rape. Obviously the outcome of child molestation is far worse for the victim than beastiality, but outcome doesn't decide the crime. Rape isn't bad purely because of its effects on the victim per se, although that's obviously a major factor, but because it's a display of blatant lack of respect for bodily autonomy, something literally everyone values short of their own life. It is one of the worst things you can steal from another.

The reason that, say, a dog having sex with another dog isn't nearly as bad as a human having sex with a dog is because of the fact that humans are moral agents, dogs aren't. Humans obviously construct systems of morality, dogs live off of instinct. Because of that, we can't expect nor should we force them to live by our moral code.

"hq946vk","By far my favourite vehicle of any game. That feeling of standing in the vehicle and being able to move your head, change cameras and pilot it concurrently was amazing. Being able to build inside, create a moving base, add aquariums and your favourite fish to a vehicle? Insanely cool.

Researching and building all these new things you start venturing into an unknown cave in search of answers tapping sonar to preserve your fuel, except you see it uncover something in the distance. You manually switch to silent mode and turn off all the lights before noticing that its swimming straight towards you screaming before it crashes into your sub. While the awesome music blares, you kick the lights back on and switch back to full power engines trying desperately to escape in an absolute panic. This base is irreplaceable you think, I have so much in here, what about Jim? The first fish you caught upon discovering aquariums exist? I'll save scum before I let Jim down I tell you.

After another hit you are forced to venture outside for immediate repairs. Reluctant, unsure of whether you're going to be immediately eaten or where the bitch is. So you fire off a precious decoy, manually leave the wheel and wade through the water seeping into your sub as fires rage and alarms blare. You jump out the hatch to repair a few holes hoping it stops the sub from perhaps blowing up, unaware and new to the game. Absolutely shitting yourself expecting a jumpscare or to be eaten at any moment. Before swimming for your life back inside, shooting off another decoy and hightailing it back to where you feel safe. When you do, you sit there, contemplating what the fuck just happened.

"hq4ya4u","The Sith code is just how people generally function. Our passions are what drive us, and because of passion we get better in whatever we're passionate about, which grants us victories in our chosen field, which even in mundane environments can be its own form of liberation. And so long as there is something needing doing, you will always be driven to action (that's the ""no peace"" part).  The Sith take this philosophy to martial action, but it can be directed at any facet of life. I also don't understand why it's considered inherently evil )there's nothing inherently evil about emotions and passion, it is NATURAL, HEALTHY, AND HUMAN). The code is equally applicable to a light-sided force user.  If their personal passion was protecting others or tending to their community, then the Sith philosophy would be just as applicable.  They'd likely be more unpredictable than a Jedi, perhaps hot-tempered or impulsive, but not inherently violent or sadistic.

The Jedi are more violent and sadistic than the sith, in a lot of different ways. 
For one, they are simply in disillusion about their own violence, because they have no problem fighting, training to fight, or becoming angry (not all anger lead to violence, it's important to draw a distinction between anger as an emotion and acting on that anger). The Jedi are sadistic in many ways, among them they take children from their parents and what Qui-Gon did to Anakin as a child to bring him to the Jedi temple would actually be illegal according to the law on this planet (stealing a blood sample from a child without parental consent which is a serious invasion of privacy and violation of human rights, and Qui-Gon even made up that whole ""checking your blood for infections"" lie, it's so creepy, it's how a cult treats children, like property, and also lying to them and deceiving them as to what the cult is doing to them). The Jedi also see other beings as their subjects, even their vassals in many cases, for example clones, which are living beings yet to a Jedi they're only marching to their death so the Jedi don't have to do their own job in the galaxy. 

The Jedi are simply unaware and delusional about their own violence and hatred, as well as their own darkness, passion, emotions, desire, etc, they believe balance to the force means only the light side wins (what kind of view of balance is the eradication of the opposing side? balance is a pluralistic society with a plurality of different religions, practices, methods, viewpoints, opinions, beliefs, etc, not a fucking echo chamber) but balance to the force actually means between the light and darkness, embracing and using both, not just the light and that's how the Jedi are delusional. The ""light"" side is the rational side of the force and the ""dark"" side is the emotional side of the force and a human being is made up of both parts, they are both rational and emotional, and there's no balance if one doesn't embrace and use both aspects of what makes them human. 

In the beginning the Jedi studied and used both aspects of the force, until a bunch of Jedi full of prejudice and extreme intolerance decided to outlaw the emotional side of the force or the emotional aspect of human beings and kill every single ""dark"" Jedi or Sith that wanted the right of self-determination and the right to determine their own conscience and beliefs. It was the Jedi's prejudice and extreme intolerance that pushed the Sith further and further into the ""dark""/emotional side. The Jedi are control freaks who don't want people to be allowed to choose and determine their own beliefs without fear of religious oppression and persecutions. A lot of Jedi are not ""good guys"". 

Also the Jedi completely blocked themselves off of feeling any emotions, they have given up their humanity and are fine with basically being machines. If you can'T FEEL, you might as well be physically dead, because you definitely are dead on the inside, life just isn't worth living when you completely block yourself off of feeling any emotions, that is unnatural and messed up and anti-human, anti-humanism. This is one of many reasons why I would rather die than join the Jedi or become a Jedi.

"hq4qeoo","A lot of the genius downsides generally make them more insufferable. Being disconnected with feelings or socially bad tends to just be kind of crap.

I mean, it's okay, as long as they're not actually alone. Have other characters constantly seek them out or whatever.

Robots and edgy ANBU types are annoying af. We like Kakashi as an adult who's a fucking annoying troll, not as an edgy preteen or ANBU robot. Fics that have a rando go into ANBU to be a robot are a dime a dozen.

I think you probably have an idea of what's bad, though, considering you don't want arrogance and what not.

""Genius"" is largely two things. One, being faster at making connections between things. So learning the pattern faster, since that's what learning is, or just connecting the dots in general faster. The other aspect is how much they've done whatever task.

In theory, geniuses of the first type should also be good socially. In real life, they might be autistic/Asperger's, and have actual social issues with their brain. But often times, it's really just the second type, where the genius is the genius because they focused on a speciality early and didn't socialize enough to gain social skills.

Whether you decide to have them deficient in social skills is your choice. But a good idea is to have someone highly skilled in one specific area, not everything, mediocre but not fully socially unaware, and maybe normal or better than normal general pattern matching skills. Motivation is also another huge factor -- genius of hard work and all that.

There are a lot of directions to go for. You just don't want them to be so particularly asocial that it'll drag the story down, because social interactions are the lifeblood of stories.

And as someone else said, maybe Shikamaru is suitable? Otherwise, how genius do they really need to be? SIs are often Kakashi genius out of the academy because they're SIs and want the power fantasy. But boosting them so far can also negatively impact the story, really.

And remember, if you protagonist is genuinely super smart, you may need to make sure enemies are appropriately smart -- as a kid, they should still be outsmarted by Danzo and Orochimaru and Tobi and Madara and so on, who all have information and skill advantages. Stories where the protag can outsmart everybody are boring as fuck, unless they're not motivated or whatever.",1640598906,"but a good idea is to have someone highly skilled in one specific area, not everything, mediocre but not fully socially unaware, and maybe normal or better than normal general pattern matching skills.","unaware, and maybe","unaware","and",TRUE,"socially unaware , and maybe normal","normal","socially","maybe",1

"hq1wse2","I dunno how funny they are outside of the context of the moment,  but when I was in Tokyo, me and my three friends found that the trains shut down at midnight and didn't open again until 5am, so we typically just partied until 5am.  The second night we were there, we got thrashed.  I don't remember everything, but I do remember ending up in this club that had a bunch of mirrors and chandeliers with green lasers bouncing around everywhere, and I think I hula hooped with some random person?

Anyway

It's 5am, and we're stumbling back to the train station.  Train arrives, and we get on.

So if you haven't heard the term ""mind the gap"", it's generally used to indicate that there is a space between the platform and the train.  In Tokyo, it was completely random. Sometimes the gaps are barely over an inch, other times it might be half a foot.  Given I was drunk and unaware, and given that this gap was on the bigger side, it should come as no surprise that my foot went completely into the gap up to my shin.

I recovered quickly, regained my balance, and got back on the train.  A couple minutes later, one of my friends said ""Uhh... You're bleeding"".  I didn't feel anything, so I kind of just laughed and looked down and saw...a lot more blood than expected.

When the bleeding didn't stop, one of my other friends who was wearing a thermal undershirt, started taking it off to make wrap my wound up, as my jeans were getting quite noticeably red.  

Meanwhile there was an American man (who apparently spoke Japanese) and a Japanese woman kind of staring at this weird scene of a drunk guy undressing and wrapping his shirt around the leg of another drunk guy who was bleeding profusely, while two other drunk guys were trying to loudly offer their advice.

As they kept watching, the woman eventually pulled a mask out of her purse and put it on while the American, I assume, tried to explain that all Americans weren't like this.

Bleeding did end up stopping before we got to the guest house we were staying at, I somehow managed to put my bloody jeans in the washer before passing out, and woke up with a new story to tell.",1640544242,"given i was drunk and unaware, and given that this gap was on the bigger side, it should come as no surprise that my foot went completely into the gap up to my shin.","drunk and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"drunk and unaware","drunk",NA,NA,0

"hpox7d4","&gt;And still people are more willing to trust memes and bullshit spewed from politicians than they are to trust the overwhelming majority of scientists.

You must realize that for a while now a bunch of people just say ""science bitch"" and then run away as if that wins them an argument right?

It's to the point that when someone says something like this, for many people, myself included, it rings bullshit detectors immediately. 

In my case, if you told me that, I would throw out your opinion immediately and ask for actual evidence.

In my case it took a bit of reading through various materials from various actually credible institutions and just logicing it out to form an opinion.

In other peoples cases that might not be what they go search. They might want community backed support because *that's all they've ever done* and they trust them (we'll come back to that*.

In fairness to them, when I went searching I will admit most of the stuff I read came across as gibberish to me. I could make  sense out of some of the methodologies and the outputted result, but I can still confidently say I have no fucking idea how MRNA works/is produced, and neither do any of the annoying asshats on reddit who post simplified explanations so simple they literally explain nothing with smug happy looks on their faces as they hit post.

Given that, for me it was more a game of game theory. Both the virus and various vaccines (only thinking about the better ones so basically excluding j&amp;j, astra etc and including Moderna, Pfizer and that russian one that seems surprisingly decent) have very little information about long term effects because they haven't been out long term, but covid shows up with some signs of negative ones long term, and I haven't yet seen signs of likely negative effects long term for vaccines. Both the virus and vaccines have short term effects, but the worse short term effects of vaccines seem either inapplicable to me, or seem relatively small vs the worst effects from covid being no more you. You then combine that information with the idea that eventually its likely that vaccinated or not Im likely to get covid even though seeing how most people act Im probably top 1 percentile in terms of following correct procedure and that's how I came to the conclusion that vaccination makes sense.

That's how someone makes that type of decision without political identity (though just because people are annoying Ill point out that I lean pretty left).

There are so many changes to how I could have grown up, how I could have valued evidence etc, that I can see how people came to a different conclusion than I did.

I could have grown up with people who devalued science. Being black, I could have easily grown up with too much distrust for the government what with the existence of  cases like the Tuskegee syphilis """"""study"""""" (they studied nothing, it was just awful). I could have had less interest in logical thinking/scientific evidence (many people dont, and infact many people who love to say ""science bitch"" dont either).

Thats a very long way of saying that you should at least try to understand how people got into the positions they are in, because you have to remember that everyone started as a little impressionable child, and they weren't molded in a vacuum.

Its easy for you to judge, but you got a vastly different life experience from them.

When you add to the mix the number of people in media and politics who might have also negatively influenced them you can clearly see a path to that opinion.


&gt;So yes, I have trouble understanding people like this because if they don't trust fact based evidence that's been replicated and studied extensively

Let's be real, the speed of this is unusual. You can give any explanations you want about test concurrency, will, funding etc etc, but you must realize that the process at bare minimum is unusual.

If you are unaware and untrusting of course you can see why when your expertise is so far removed, you rely on *gut feelings* and *smell tests* purely. Those arent great nor objective ways to decide things but thats how things work for a lot of people because in reality, you simply cant be an expert on everything. Of course though, thats taking that idea a bit too far.

&gt;Now it's been a year, millions of people have gotten it with almost no serious side effects. 

A year is nothing really. A year is us more or less still assuming that assumptions medical companies have made are correct (that essentially all you are left with after (I believe 2 weeks or so) is the antibodies to deal with covid. A year is us believing that they work the way they think they do.

Obviously when I say assumption in that context its means a bit more than assumption usually means because from what I'
ve read the actual mechanisms for how they work seem understood unlike other medicines where we sorta guess and check and ""hey it does the thing whoopee!"".That being said the point remains that this isn't some 10 year old tried and tested treatment so if especially if you arent an expert, and arent going to try to look things up or reason things out, what are you going to think?

This is brand new technology in terms of usage, and the speed looks and feels different. When your primary method of decision making is gut feeling, you can see how that turns out differently than you might hope.

&gt; Most I've heard from just think covid is an overblown hoax and that the vaccine is unnecessary. The main reason those people aren't getting it is because Biden is telling them they have to.

Like sure some of it is politics, but lets not pretend that this doesn't extend to all sides at least somewhat.

That's not me saying both sides are equal, but that your scatter chart is slightly more scattered than you think.

People unfortunately for you don't all just fit into one neat caricature. They have different life experiences, motivations, and systems of trust.

"hovi4fp","I've quite a few in a 2E game I run as a GM. I think 'Drop' stands out for me though.

In Middenheim, one of my players is dueling the Champion of Middenheim in a festival duel (not to the death or anything) and one of my players who plays a High Elf Mage with a few screws loose, is watching this unfold.

With the motivation that he would like to help out the other player, Galdrea the elf casts the 'Drop' spell on the Champion. This is done as subtly as he can, casting while whispering the words.

It worked, and the Champion is heavily bemused as his weapon drops to the ground. However, the elf player did not account for Ser Gado's honour. You see, the player he's helping plays a honourable Knight from Bretonnia, a slightly naïve one at that. He picks up his weapon, oblivious as to what is really happening, and challenges the Champion to rematch.

The Champ obliges. What happens next is hilarious. Galdrea attempts several more castings of Drop, which are all successful, however, the Champion has to fail a willpower test for it to succeed against him. While he failed the first time, he keeps passing every subsequent one.

Finally, on the last one, just as it looks like Ser Gado is about to be defeated, the Champion drops his weapon. Ser Gado is declared victorious. Slightly confused as he was losing, but none the less, he accepts victory.

However... Consequences are now in play. I make a hidden perception roll for an npc. This npc happens to be a wizard from the Guild of Magic in Middenheim. And he has detected what has been going on here.

Long story short - Ser Gado and Galdrea, the High Elf mage (also an ambassador to the said Guild of Magic from Ulthuan) are arrested and put on trial. Cue two sessions of me doing a court drama, and I make it interesting for my players by allowing those whose characters are not involved in the trial, to play as prosecution and defense while my npcs were the Judges. I make it quite clear to my players that the stakes are high here. The gloves are off due to the serious nature of the charge and that a quick trial is in the interests of the State.

Ser Gado, the Bretonnian knight, is found not guilty, having been deemed that he was unaware and oblivious to all of this.

Galdrea the High Elf is found guilty. Normally, such a breach of magical law along with the circumstances that they conducted themselves in, would result in their head being clamped into a vice and slowly crushed like a melon. However... because they are an important person (Ulthuan magical ambassador of sorts) they are given some leeway, not to mention that the Guild speaks up on their behalf. They must profusely offer their apologies to the Champion, plead for salvation of their soul by kneeling in front of the Statue of Ulric at the Middenheim temple after conducting a 'walk of shame' and finally, be expelled from Middenland, never to return.

I made it clear to the player before hand that this is what I was going to do, that he would have to make a new character for the campaign. He was quite happy with doing that, fully accepted what he did and we just all had a laugh about it. It still pops up in conversation now and again as 'Drop Drop Drop'.",1639714088,"ser gado, the bretonnian knight, is found not guilty, having been deemed that he was unaware and oblivious to all of this.","unaware and oblivious","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and oblivious","oblivious",NA,NA,1

"hofkgxa","Horse Cavalry on most battlefields in history finds their value in their ability to carry out swift flanking maneuvers and rapid advances into weak points and into the enemy's supplies and rear. Ranged rifle fire began to blunt the impact of Cavalry charges even more so than the pikeman/bayonet square formations of old.  Even during the battle of Waterloo (at the end of the Napoleonic Wars) the squares helped blunt the impact of horse cavalry charges.

In the US Civil War (and the wars you have mentioned) cavalry still had a strong role to play in scouting and being a rapid shock force, particularly useful in those flanking and supply line sorts of raids.  One of the major changes that impacted the use of horse cavalry (aside from the deadly machine guns of WW1 and later) was the use of standardized rifle cartridges.  Rifles that now could be reloaded very quickly and with better range and accuracy, a trained rifleman with a clear field of fire might be able to get off multiple shots at a horse-mounted calvary man before the latter could get into melee range. The Calvary unit is also a much larger target for the infantryman as well.  This also applies to artillery.  Field artillery also gets smaller (and larger), lighter, easier to reload, more accurate, and more deadly over this time period.  

Horse Calvary attacks into even minimally prepared positions became a horrible waste of resources.  Up to and even including some WW1 battles Calvary's objective was specifically to avoid fixed positions and find routes of supply, unaware and unfortified forces, disrupt the ability to create fixed positions and prevent the enemy Calvary from doing the same.  Even in the early days of the trenches of the Western Front, it was believed that if a hole in the lines could be punched enough to get Calvary through it could be used to exploit the gap and potentially turn a flank.  

Horses continued to play an important role even in WW2 for moving men and material around the front lines.  Mechanization in the forms of armored vehicles and tanks replaced the role from WW2 moving forward.   The late 19th and early 20th centuries' wars marked the transition from Horse to Mechanized Cavalry even if most of the tactics stayed the same.  I believe that the gap in having the technology to adequately replace the horse on the battlefield directly led to the stalemate issues seen at the Western Front, which in many ways echoed a similar stalemate 50 years earlier during the US Civil War on the Virginia Front.   I believe that there is a gradient between the two time periods where militaries had to come to grips with the industrialization of warfare and what that means for the role of cavalry and it's transition into the ""modern"" era.",1639432303,"up to and even including some ww1 battles calvary's objective was specifically to avoid fixed positions and find routes of supply, unaware and unfortified forces, disrupt the ability to create fixed positions and prevent the enemy calvary from doing the same.","unaware and unfortified","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unfortified","unfortified",NA,NA,1

"ho3mlzj","Being a bro to the co means to help find them ways to overcome their own issues. 

Business is a struggle, actually, all organisations are. Often when you’re in, you’re too busy to work on it. Also for profits typically take funds, and if R&amp;D includes true care for output lifecycle, then you probably find that there is apathy for costs that can be pushed onto the people that demanded the goods and services - the purchaser. 

One small thing is that in a catastrophe or for the very disadvantaged, having waste means parts for repairing and refurbishing and rebuilding. But that’s no excuse, just something that helps a small minority. My foundation in tech came from first disassembling, then trying to repair damaged and broken, abandoned goods.  But I created a large waste stream as well. 

That tech that is discarded, needs collection points where it can be carefully checked for repairability, and collated until scale and volume makes processing easy. 

Most companies have escalation points. If it’s a common problem and you collate data on frequency by time applied to public complaints or mentions, it’s good to non-confrontationally share it with the company as they are often unaware and oblivious to issues. It doesn’t mean there will be an immediate resolution or an assistance in return, especially if out of warranty, or even care, but it’s something that gives strength to you, as you’ve more than fulfilled your obligations to advise the company if products fail prematurely. 

Also, sometimes a comprehensive and formal approach work wonders. I’ve had many items replaced when I collated accurate details, but I’ve been embarrassed a few times as well when the issues I found were to be caused by the user, (me or others) or not identified as user issues by me, when engaged as a technician. If you give an issue attention, and realise it’s your issue, the product is fine or simply used in a way that’s not per design, then at least you discover that rather than being clueless. 

I’d take a photo and get help summarising the text, then post it in a part-public part-private forum as the information then is shared, so you’re more likely to get assistance or acknowledgment or find others with the same issues. But search it first! 

Note. There’s a plethora of people posting on expensive tech. On low cost items, often it’s a dearth of reviews and flagged issues. It’s not unkind to constructively criticise and advise improvement on goods that are very low cost. But be kind. Don’t use all caps. :)",1639212611,"if it’s a common problem and you collate data on frequency by time applied to public complaints or mentions, it’s good to non-confrontationally share it with the company as they are often unaware and oblivious to issues.","unaware and oblivious","unaware","and",FALSE,"often unaware and oblivious","oblivious","often",NA,1

And to clarify, yes, they are referred to as MEN, not MALES, as you called them in a different post. I know it must be tough trying to pretend that you aren't an incel, but calling men ""males"" or women ""females"" is kind of a dead giveaway, not mention calling ""males"" stupid and unaware and advocating for a world in which 70% of the population are women. Admittedly I don't know if you ever argued for trying to transition to that ratio, but that's still a big yikes. 

Your original post was that some women have been left with 0 self worth due to men, which is true. Someone says ""and vice versa..."" and you respond with ""Hardly."" Not only that, you then respond with rape, murder, and theft statistics which no one fucking asked for. Are you trying to argue that the main way people lose self esteem and self worth are due to rape, murder (how the fuck can you lose self esteem from being murdered, you are dead ffs, why on god's green earth did you even cite this statistic), and theft (also pretty irrelevant but ok). I understand that rape isn't exactly boosting people's self esteem, but the large majority of people have not been raped, and yet over half of the population has poor self esteem. Clearly, they are losing self esteem from other places, so when you argue that men lose self esteem from women a lot less than the other way around, you might be able to successfully argue that, but the statistics you cite are irrelevant. I'm not aware of any good way of measuring exactly which people are degrading your self esteem and what their gender is. Usually, you don't even notice when your self-esteem is being whittled away, since if you did, you would probably ignore it. The fact is, trying to figure out which gender reduces the other gender's self esteem more is extremely difficult, and copy/pasting crime statistics 15 times in this thread isn't gonna change anyone's mind. 

And yes, you do need to look inward, because you are a femcel and possibly a misandrist who is using statistics that, while alarming and speak to a bigger societal problem, are completely irrelevant to the discussion on self-esteem, yet you are using those statistics to justify ignoring problems a large number of men face. You need to understand that men (not males) are people and individuals and most face just as many problems and societal issues as most women do.

"hnmtnkf","My first trip produced a very similar epitaph. 
It was the day before thanksgiving, the autumn after my graduation from high school. My first semester of college was going ok. I had started smoking weed with my friends whom I had know only about 3 years. One night we had procured roughly an eighth of mushrooms. I was NOT a part of the plan to take them, but after I found out I insisted that I join. There was no resistance to my participation so the three of us split the eighth. I had the most profound experience of my life. It was as if I had suddenly became aware of my own fucking existence. Like I had never once thought of my self for 18 fucking years. I had flashes of my friendships throughout my childhood, and everything looked very very sad. I looked at the clothing and the objects I had that were “mine,” and realized the shirt I had on was given to me, the belt I had on was someone else’s, the Levi’s I had were hand-me-downs, my wallet was found/stolen from someone in a locker room years and years prior in junior high, and finally I wasn’t even suppose to be there that night, I had annoyingly invited myself. I just completely lost it. Who the hell was I, and how had I been so unaware. This feeling stuck with me for a long time, and is still probably with me to some degree to this very day (some 13 years later). I’ve accepted a lot of things, and have even seen a therapist about it all. I’m sure it boils down to my terrible upbringing and moving from place to place as a child to facilitate my step dads meth addiction. So anyway, I suffer from extreme self-consciousness now  cause I don’t want to annoy people which causes major anxiety and it’s sucks. But for years I thought, “God, if only I could go back to being unaware, and just happy-go-lucky I would be so much better off.” But no! Fuck that! I look back at that person with humility and shame!

I think that you nailed it there. There are numerous tools of the ""jailers"" at your disposal. I am fairly certain that most of these people (tools) do not realize the truth, but are instead bound to obey via threats, bribes, extortion, calling in of favors, etc. But the example you gave above is very well done and a fine example.

As some have already said, I agree that it is completely up to you, and to a lesser extent, your players how this goes. In my vision of the world, the Archons and even Lictors (for the most part) are completely unaware and unconcerned with the player characters. They have many other things to concern themselves with. That said, if the player characters become an issue, disrupt plans, or become known for some reason... well, that is a different story.

I think that despite the power vacuum, there are many who still take their ""job"" seriously and are active in it. After all, that is why they were created, right? It is difficult to go against your very core programming, and theirs is to maintain the illusion.

As a last bit of advice/idea, you may wish to look into similar situations for ideas. For example, how is it that organized crime groups maintained the illusion of normalcy?  How do vampires in Vampire the Masquerade maintain the Masquerade? How do corporations and governments keep secrets hidden and dissuade whistleblowers?

"hnkrfjc","Make music for your souls expression, for you as hard as that may be. You want people to like it and even your inner child wants the approval of others if you heal that kids self esteem and self image you will heal yourself currently and smash that mental block out of your path.

 I’ve been singing since 5 years old , playing guitar and writing songs since 15 years old , performing my originals since 15, audio engineering and producing since 17 years old and I am currently 29.  My crippling self doubt anxiety depression and adhd throughout most of those years has made it so I am sitting on a hard drive full of full songs and half baked material that I never released due to lack of follow through and shame surrounding my mental block due to mental illness. But .. since Something had shifted in me and it has one source 

 Micro dosing psilocybin has changed my creative soul/ mind and I am finally seeing the world in colour again. 

I  discovered this year I am autistic and was diagnosed young with PDD pervasive development disorder which is an off branch of autism spectrum disorder and typically used to define people on the spectrum with milder symptoms or when they show some symptoms but not some of the obvious textbook social or sensory issues at a high degree or are relatively good at self coaching / masking without awareness they are analyzing people and mirroring their behaviours effectively enough to pass. My parents chose to not tell me this because they figured I would develop better if I was unaware and less insecure etc. My mother passed away when I was young and my dad kinda just assumed my symptoms went away themselves. But truthfully I was living in Terror and sensory overload but didn’t know my experience differed from others only felt that it did, just felt misunderstood, weird and crazy my whole life. 

 I have sensitivity to light, sound, touch, taste, smell etc and  I didn’t realize that my capacity to self medicate was a way to numb myself and dull my senses and abilities and natural strengths related to my high sensitivity.  I was coping with Junk food, caffeine, sugars, marijuana, alcohol etc and using them all moderately yet mildly enough that I wasn’t aware it was killing my soul and spirit and lowering my connection to my creativity and source. When I am writing and In the zone I feel one with the world, this present, tuned in feeling that’s meditative etc. When I finally realized on a sensory level I was killing my talents I found a healthier relationship with what I choose to put in my body and instantly my songs and my sound started to soar out of me with joy and confidence again, like when I played as a child to let my complex feelings out. On a physiological level I was finally aware and attuned to my body again and using my hyper sensitivity as a superpower not a detriment. 

 But what woke me up was one night I had a relatively small macro dose of magic mushrooms (roughly 1G ) to be exact. 

I had a lovely experience, laughing with myself, playing music over my speakers, watching the ceiling shift and wave etc and danced in the living room. I woke up the next day without depression or anxiety or fear etc , I felt clear, like my internal radio signal in my brain finally tracked the right channel where my thoughts and hopes and dreams were set free without doubt. If anything I was hopeful for the first time in over 10 years. I reminded myself of the passionate young girl I used to be who’s songs just flew out of her like lighting in a bottle. Except only now, I wasn’t making my diagnoses my problem, but my solution and fully accepting the way my mind works and creating pathways for myself to thrive knowing who I am and not what I think people want me to be. 

This lead me to research micro dosing , I am currently doing the Stamets Stack 2x a week on my weekend.  50mg psilocybin: 250mg Niacin, 250mg Lions Mane. With lots of water and eating a light healthy meal 30 mins after dosing. 

 I’m not perfect and I still hit walls because of my executive functioning issues but if you want to break through a mental block magic mushrooms may be a very effective natural approach. I have a history of depression and anxiety and adhd pharmaceuticals that ultimately numbed me, which got rid of some of my symptoms but killed my spirit. Magic mushrooms has been the first thing that has shifted my frame of mind to a place of acceptance of myself, self love, transcendence. 

My micro dose is so low I don’t have any visions or hallucinations, I am simply calm and my mind is wide open,  it lets the ideas flow through at a poignant level. 

 Maybe you need to crack open your spirit and not focus on the productivity or how to fix your problem on an analytical level by forcing to hit targets or sound like other people or study or make x amount of beats etc.  but first heal your heart and get yourself in a place where the music takes you on the journey and your present and along for the ride which ever way the road winds. 

Sorry if this was long winded and jumped around, I thought maybe my story would add a level of context and show my true intent; which is that I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, you are beautiful and capable of magic, you just have to be open to it which first takes a bit of faith and belief in your abilities. It’s kind of nice that since micro dosing my ego is way milder / less vocal and isn’t whispering in my ear that I am not living up to my potential and that I’m fucked up. Instead my ego kinda comes out now as the supportive internal best friend that gives me a “you fucking rock” sentiment and then moves along to leave room for compassion empathy selflessness and love. Balancing the line between connection to thy self and therefore connection to the world.

"hn4k1uj","The report started like this: *On the twelfth of Dustmonth, just after a storm that was bad enough to shutter the windows, Father did not wake up.*



Prianna stopped writing and stared down at the parchment. It took some effort to hold the quill without snapping it; Father had made sure that she had an excellent grasp of her own strength, but the unfamiliar feelings that had settled into her chest made it difficult to keep hold of it properly. 



She felt roughly as if someone had jammed a pin into the clockwork of her heart, so that the gears ground together, stuttering and jumping and unable to fully turn. She felt like someone had scraped a thin line through the sigils etched into her sternum, so that the magic that helped make her *her* came in uneven, gasping little spurts. 



Unfamiliar. Unpleasant. *Wrong*. Father would have been able to explain it, but Father was gone. The physician had taken him away.



She sucked in a breath (the bellows that were her lungs felt too small), and then hunched over to continue. 



*He did not wake when I called for him. He did not wake when I brought him breakfast. He did not wake when the Baroness summoned him, and so she sent Missus Anundi to see what was the matter. Missus Grant was upset when she saw him. She sent for the physician, and then the physician and his assistants covered Father in a sheet and took him away.



I am therefore forced to conclude that Father is dead.*



Prianna understood death, in a way. She knew what it meant for Constructs, like her, and for anything that had been made by the hands of someone else, clockwork or magic or both. It meant being still, and unaware, and non-functioning. ‘Death’ to an inorganic creation was generally a temporary ailment.



She also knew, in a general sense, what death meant for organic life. Father’s old assistant, Nidal, had explained it to her like this: death was what happened when a body and mind stopped working entirely. He had shown her a pheasant the young princes had killed on their last hunt, and she had seen the hole the crossbow bolt had made in its chest, and the blood, and she had heard the silence in its chest.



There were no marks from crossbows on Father’s body, but his heart was silent, too. So, therefore, he was dead.



*And, therefore, Prianna wrote, I must also assume that someone has killed him, which means that I will have to find out who.*



She pushed away from her writing desk and stood, brushing off the baggy front of her pants. Her room was small, more a repurposed storage closet, with space enough for her desk, her shelf of books, and a small mattress that had only been useful since four months ago, when Father had managed to find a way to allow her to sleep. 



She opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. The Keep was abuzz with activity. Prianna supposed she understood why; the Baroness’ Mage was dead, which was bad. Father had been much beloved and, apart from that, very important to the workings of the state, or so she understood.



Missus Anundi had told her that there would be a very grand funeral for him, before the morticians brought him down to the tombs beneath their feet and laid him to rest-- although what *that* meant escaped her. It seemed to Prianna that someone who was dead had nothing else to do *but* rest. The line between ‘just sleeping’ and ‘dead’ seemed very slim.



But she didn’t have time to think about it for long. She had work to do.



She walked briskly down the corridor to the library. There was an army of servants busily polishing the marble floor, and it was so clean that Prianna could see her reflection in it. She looked ‘remarkably human’, or so she’d been told. She had the same proportions as them, she supposed, two arms and two legs, one head. No tail, although she liked tails (or the ones on the Keep’s various catdrakes, at least), and the soft, supple red-brown porcelain that made up the majority of her body looked (and felt) rather like skin. 



Her sable hair, pinned and hidden beneath a green *yanila* (the headscarf any unmarried person wore), was *real* hair, though she had never asked where it had come from. It was enough that it was hers, she supposed. Her eyes were the color of copper. Nidal had told her once that she was modeled like a doll, with seams at her joints to allow for easy access. Prianna had seen dolls before. She liked to think she was more impressive a creation.



The library was quiet, a sharp contrast to the hum of activity outside. It was a massive room, three stories tall, with shelves that stretched right up to the ceiling. Every available spot was crammed with books, some so old the spines had started to crack. There were tall, wide windows that let in beams of warm sunlight, which Prianna could only just feel. 



Father had been in the process of modifying her ability to physically feel things. He had told her it would only be a matter of weeks before she would understand why people smiled when the sun warmed their skin.


Now he was dead.


She stopped and looked around. “Vala-Vala,” she called out. She wondered if organics could feel the plucking of their vocal chords as they spoke. Probably not. “Are you here? I need to talk to you.”


There was a gasp from somewhere above. Prianna lifted her head, and saw Vala-Vala. They were a sphynx, with the head of an amber-skinned woman, and the body of a lion. They had a pair of white wings folded against their back; they also wore a *yanila*, a blue one, and their chest was covered by a loose scarf in the same color. They were balanced on the top of a very tall ladder.


“Oh, Pri,” they said, and breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness, it’s only you. You nearly gave me a heart attack…” They turned back to the shelf they had been organizing. “It’s been a nightmare of activity this morning, all over the Keep. I was worried it was going to move in here next, and I don’t want anyone touching my books, trying to *clean* them-- they wouldn’t even begin to know how to do it properly…”


“Vala-Vala,” Prianna said again. “I need to talk to you.”


Vala-Vala blinked, and glanced down. Then they nodded. “Alright,” they said. They spread their wings and jumped, gliding down to the floor, then took a moment to smooth out their scarf before they asked, “What can I do for you?”


Prianna watched them. “Father is dead,” she informed them, although she thought it was likely they already knew.



Vala-Vala’s ears went back. “Oh, dear,” they said. “It didn’t even occur to me that-- yes, you *would* be rather upset, wouldn’t you?” They sat down, tail curling over their front paws sheepishly. “Forgive me, I didn’t think to ask. Are you alright?”


She shook her head, although not in response. “That isn’t important,” she said. ‘I need your assistance with something. Father is dead. I must discover who killed him.”

The fur along their spine stood straight up. “Who-- you think he was *murdered*?” They asked, aghast. “I swore Physician Hidul said ‘natural causes’. Do you have reason to suspect otherwise?”


Prianna tilted her head. “He is dead,” she said. It was as simple as that, of course; death meant that one had been killed. Someone had to do the killing. Like the pheasant. “I have to find who killed him. Will you help me?”


“Oh,” Vala-Vala said, and sighed softly. They reached out with a paw, cupping her cheek against their pads. “Oh, I understand. Sweet Pri. Your father wasn’t *killed*, he simply *died*.”


She stared. Why were they contradicting themself? If Father was dead, he had been killed. “I don’t understand,” she said. “That doesn’t make sense.”


“Yes it does,” they said. “Master Ondal was old, Prianna. He was an old man, and human, and they only live for so many years before they can’t anymore.” Their ears twitched. “You have to understand this, Pri; no one killed your father. The only thing that happened to him was time.”


Time. The complex gears in Prianna’s head began to spin with that idea between them. She nodded. “I see,” she said, because she did. Vala-Vala had been just as helpful as she’d hoped they would be. 


They smiled, a little sadly. “Do you? I hope you understand, Prianna.”


“I do,” she said, because she did. It was very simple. 


Father was dead because he was old. It was time that had killed him. 


*Therefore*, she wrote later, when she had retreated to her room to pack her things, *it is obvious what I must do. If Time is to blame, then I must find Time, and then bring them to the proper authorities.*",1638572024,"it meant being still, and unaware, and non-functioning.","still, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"unaware , and non","non",NA,NA,1

"hmw8njk","I mean I've heard plenty of people complain about how the dragons are written, especially in the third movie and the shows.

Dagur to many is just not funny and a vessel for the writers to do as many twists and turns as they want cause ""he's crazy haha""

Heather to many (and this one includes myself) is just so boring. There's nothing really original about her character and screams of a more angsty Astrid clone that was originally made as a weird love interest for Hiccup despite everyone knowing he'd end up with Astrid.

I don't hate Astrid, but the way her character is written is more inconsistent than Toothless's eye color in RTTE. 

In HTTYD 1 she's this tough, dury driven and smart viking warrior that doesn't really care about emotional things. But her turn is too quick for me and she delivers the worst line of the movie: ""Figure out what side you're on."" 

The line makes no sense given the context and from Astrid's POV it's literally a line written for the audience. 

In GOTNF she's uncharacteristically cheery, feminine and emotionally. Nowhere else does she care so much about other people's feelings and it's really strange. She's also extremely unaware and incapable which is just... not Astrid.

In HTTYD2 she's a walking exposition telling people what's happening what they should do. And she's extremely dumb. Her logic to finding Eret and going to Drago instead of idk tracking Hiccup and Stoick down is really flawed. She also strangely refuses direct orders from Stoick which seems strange given her previously established sense of duty and responsibility. Astrid's idiocy in the second movie is also directly the cause of Drago attacking the nest when he did (which was the worst time possible) and Berk. She INFORMED Drago that Berk had gotten involved, that Hiccup rode dragons, and that he had a Night Fury (Not to mention she got them all captured by going there in the first place).

In THW Astrid's arguably at her strongest in terms of writing. Good combination of strong, and dury driven, but you see she has mellowed down due to being with Hiccup.

So I'm going to bring a bit of unrelated drama here. There is a user called ""mastermewtwo"" on the Smogon forums who specifically spams Mewtwo on the ladder. Both Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Mewtwo Y, and recently he proved that even base form Mewtwo is workable on ladder. He always runs 6 Mewtwos. Well, he was absent up until this recent Suspect Test, and his actions caused the Gen 7 meta to be worse through his DNB vote on Shell Smash.

For those not aware, Shell Smash is an extremely powerful setup move that resulted in Prankster being mandatory as Moongeist Beam, Sunsteel Strike, and Photon Geyser could ignore Unaware and other defensive abilities, as well as Stored Power and Power Trip having high enough base powers to remove them as well.

If you check that Suspect Test req post above, you'll see me responding to this user. He brings up the absolute fucking *nonsense* suggestion of banning Focus Sash, and he thinks that Shell Smash isn't banworthy as a result. He causes the result to go DNB, and it's clear he wasn't good at the meta as he required over a hundred games to get his reqs. I shredded him because of the stupid points he brought up, then I suggested a Species/Forme Clause addition as that was the next best thing since his teams were way more effective than they should have been.

Well, over the next month mastermewtwo ladders and peaks ladder multiple times with a team that uses 6 Mewtwos, as he learns that makes an extremely effective HO team. This user is [extremely toxic on ladder](https://imgur.com/a/4puK3dd). He ends up beating a lot of high profile BH players solely because his team was nearly impossible to keep up with. Well, other ***actually good*** players catch wind of this HO archetype, then USUM BH becomes a HO hellscape as other players constantly one-up each other with different implementations of said team. Eventually MMX got &gt;200% usage as seen in the post, and the council agreed to vote on Forme Clause.

That user ain't reaching Top 500 again without his beloved mewtwo spam team. Boo hoo. As for Species/Forme Clause itself, it was discussed a few times during the gen, but up until recently, it wasn't a big problem and was rarely seen except on meme teams.

"hmnhc07","Nope, just by getting a look at the comments on this thread answers the question : people are basically unaware and uninterested, they already gave up their ""democracy"" and watching its true last moments doesn't even get to them.
I'm from France and most people here dont give a shit about their country slipping deeper into totalitarism. They already gave up everything (their rights, their freedom of movement, their physical integrity, their confidential medical information, etc.) because they basically don't see the value in any of these things.
They have the internet and home delivered meals, why would they want anything else ? Why would they care about anything else ? 
2 days ago, the Swiss people voted a referendum about getting the country into a state of emergency (gives way more power and freedom to do what they want with no repercussion and less responsibility to the government) that would last 20 years. Swiss is the only country where this happened, the only one that worked as democracy was meant to work, the only one to ask its citizens their opinion and include them in the making of such an important decsion. This vote was a tremendous symbol. They voted yes to a 20 year long state of emergency. The people had to choose : play the pandemic game (which does 2 major things : - getting huge companies and lobbies richer/getting small businesses poorer, and - making the citizens more and more submissive, dependant and obedient to big dominator lobbies), or walk away from all the nonsense that governments and medias have been serving us non-stop since covid is a ""thing"".
All over Europe absolutely massive protests are happening, in Australia, they are happening, in America, they are happening, but since the media and big techs (the 2 major sources of information) are barely touching these subjects, and mostly doing so in a negative light when they do, most people who 'passively' get their info have no clue about whats really happening.
It has always been like that anyway, nothing new under the sun : the major medias are extremely selective in their subjects and work together as to give one singular narrative that will guide the most of the consumer-population into the hypnotic state of total physical submission and mental subversion to the governments and the companies that sponsor them.

One is that some people were saying in telegram the team was a know scam team.

Hell even on here I was posting I knew this team scammed this literally token weeks ago, and I’m sure some dismissed as fud. 

The other is this team did a really good job hiding their initial rug. Banning people on telegram. Having little other social media presence for people to alert the scam (that knew). It hard to rug a token, relaunch, and fool new people because they couldn’t find out.

Let me be more specific.

For example, saying CAAC holding EH shares because the stock price was going up (which of course is patently false) shows clear bias: would he suggest FAA is holding Joby shares when JOBY stock goes up? Or EASA is holding Lilium shares when LILM is up?

This is particularly ironic, unaware and Western elitist considering the FAA and Boeing 737 MAX debacle. Put that aside, to publicly insinuate there is inappropriateness, based on no specific information, except for established prejudices that “somehow if Chinese companies and agencies are doing well or working closely, there must be something nefarious” is racist.

You'll be numb and maybe it hurts a bit from the procedure but as for what they did, that is something you'll never recall. And yes, during the session your anxiety is not manifested consciously, so you're not fighting the dental surgeon.

They still use local anesthesia like numbing and so forth because it would physically hurt during the extraction. To them, remember, you're awake. And can feel things and respond to what they tell you to do, like turn your head, open wider, whatever. But you will not remember that.

The phenomenon is called anterograde amnesia. The drugs mean you cannot remember new information, e.g. the procedure. So an injection, followed by hello, please sit in this chair for your recovery, all in what seems like a blink of an eye. Highly recommended for the dental terrified.

Typical methods can vary from Nitrous Oxide gas through a nose mask, to oral anti-anxiety medications before the procedure (which I understand is uncommon in the UK) to a quick IV shot of propofol and midazolam, all of which are very short acting.

"hlw82k3","So, you want to have code generating code? The general area is called meta-programming, the specific task is code generation.

There are approaches in code generation ranging from simple but wrong to difficult but less wrong. The simplest way you can go about it is just string replacement (in this context, it's often called ""interpolation""). This approach is very common because it's easy to implement. The drawbacks are: nesting becomes very complicated, hard to generalize the code, a lot of errors due to lax validation.

Historically, second best thing was so-called F-expressions. We won't dwell on it since this is virtually extinct today.

Next were macros. Macros work well if your programming language can expose the structure of your code as data. (Python cannot really). There are all kinds of macros: syntax macros, symbol-level macros, macros applied to whole expressions.

Especially syntax macros proved to be dangerous / inconvenient because in the languages which have those it's sometimes possible to break unrelated code by implementing a syntax macro.

Then, people invented hygienic macros which limited the scope in which the macros could be applied, and syntax case to replace the overreaching syntax macros.

One thing that was lacking was generality and some sort of systematization, and that's how meta-parsers appeared, i.e. languages specifically designed to create another languages.

"hlu3lor","For people asking how this could happen:

I have a friend who posed for Playboy in 2009. She doesn't have a very active social media presence, so she has a lot of problems with people taking her pictures and making fake scam accounts. She does, however, have a small fans Facebook page that she updates very sporadically. I'm an admin for her page, I mostly screen the PMs (SO MANY COCKS) to see which ones she needs to actually see and respond to, which are very, very few. In late 2016, the page got a message from a guy that claimed that he was in a relationship with her and was trying to contact her. Um, excuse me, I know her boyfriend, he's currently on Gears 4 with me, and it's not you. I send him a message.

The guy starts explaining how he's been in contact with her, totally fictitious backstory involving Nigeria (because of fucking course) and that he had left his family and had moved to be with her. Whoever actually was doing the scamming somehow got him to move 180 miles away from where she actually lived, blissfully unaware that he was actually that close. Red flags, set off, I want to just block him, she wants to help.

She kind of felt bad for him and messaged him privately, told them that he'd been scammed, offered to help him get back home but made sure he knew in no uncertain terms that she wasn't who he was talking to. She agreed to call him on my phone, which has a different area code from the one she lives in. The guy went *nuts*. As in batshit insane, not nuts. The guy was in his 50s, had been a preacher, LEFT HIS WIFE FOR AN E-GIRL and was going off on her, blaming her for tempting him. Here's one of the last messages he sent:

I guess I'll never know [redacted] like I imagined. [redacted] is a beautiful woman but she is glorifying the flesh while inwardly she is being corrupted and she isn't even aware or she doesn't care. I prayed a prayer for you this morning [redacted]. I prayed God would protect you from harm and evil. Remember we are free will agents in this life but remember also the choices we make have consequences and I pray that sinks in and turns you around to glorify God by honoring Him instead of your sitting on the throne of your heart.

Get off the dragon an allow God to remove the noose from around your neck that you allowed the enemy of your soul  to hold you there where you are spiritually.

I admire your empathy and compassion, BUT regardless of what his parents have done, who failed him, what mental health issues he had, he continuously had a choice . He chose the wrong path which lead to him murdering someone. There are plenty of people who are abused, assaulted , hurt, tortured throughout their lives and never go on to do what he did. No amount of abuse from others, society, etc can even justify what he had done. He didn’t want help. He was clearly self unaware and probably narcissistic . Read his Instagram. He spewed about caring about the world and not using plastic bottles, but assaulted his girlfriend and murdered her. The pain he felt? The only pain he felt was knowing that his life was ruined. He didn’t even think about hers because he murdered her , by strangulation. I personally don’t believe most abusers are able to be helped because they tend to be narcissistic and believe that they are justified in their abuse ; usually they believe everyone else is the problem , not them . I was in a DV situation and he had baggage growing up, but not to the extent I did , but he had severe anger issues that led to him busting my lip , bruising my arms, almost breaking my arm, etc. I felt bad for him although his upbringing was far better than mine and continuously tried to get him into therapy. He told me I was the problem, he didn’t have anger issues, I was the cause and when I was gone, he wouldn’t be angry anymore. Abusers have no accountability.

"hlrhgws","This sounds A LOT like a description of my friend's ex that I suspect is a narcissist. Maybe not a bad person, but quite a horrible partner (although divine at times, the mental effort it took to be in that relationship on other occasions was huge). Not necessarily (or fully) a narcissist, but often dismissive and oblivious to others' needs and wants if they don't match his. Also presents traces of gaslighting, even if unintentional. Definitely had issues he's not willing to acknowledge and work on. 

  
✓Dreams of being rich and *showers* his partner with love and gifts **but** gets angry and self righteous when he feels misunderstood, even if there's no need and you yourself are trying to solve the issue together with him.   
✓Has depression but doesn't seek help. In his case he was the kind of person that dreamed of the perfect partner that would understand him and love him nonetheless and eventually that would be the way he finds redemption. Took him years and a hard breakup and also many pushes and talks on the subject before the breakup for him to start going to therapy.   


He also had a lot of relationships that didn't work, with very little time between the end of one and the beginning of the other. History of cheating (he cheated and on other occasion he was also the person someone else cheated with. He was aware of what he was doing and the worst part is he also was friends with the guy that was cheated on). He couldn't stand to be alone without a girlfriend to support him emotionally and that he could lean on to solve his emotional issues and ""be patient with him"" when he was basically a nasty human being with no accountability whatsoever. Eventually all of them got sick of it so he's had a lot of troubled long-term relationships. His conclusion: ""I wish to only remember the good parts"". To me, that's lacking accountability and slightly delusional.   
✓Long and difficult conversations. They would only end if he wanted to, otherwise they were necessary for mutual understanding and because ""that's how we learn stuff"". It didn't matter that the subject was not relevant anymore or that the endless hours and arguments distressed other people because they got sick of it. It also often didn't matter if he was wrong and you showed him proof and sources for your arguments -  if he was not ready to let it go, then he'd keep bringing it up. And the worst part is he's often keep calm and feel superior to the other person if they got upset and lost their patience, even if they often rightfully did so.   
✓About friends and jealousy, he often wanted her to accompany him when he went to see his friends and vice-versa. He was also very jealous on her male friends. At some point he was so annoying when we were in a group that I started seeing her less because I couldn't tell her I disliked him (tried once) and didn't want him to come.   
✓Accuses you of being ignorant and selfish and not caring about his feeling while being blissfully unaware and uninterested in yours.   
He is also the kind of person that is desperate to feel needed or useful and often gives unsolicited advice or even ""constructive criticism"", while flawlessly ignoring his own issues and denying them when others bring them up.  
I'm saying all of this hoping that it could help you, maybe there is something that went unnoticed until now and my awfully long comment helps you see it. I also tried to show that this kind of person can be a type and unless you see that the change comes from the inside, I wouldn't hope for it.  
I don't think you should have a kid with him and I'm pretty sure it won't solve any of your problems. If anything they will add up... In my opinion it would be a huge disservice to all three of you. This doesn't even seem like an issue about having kids anymore to me, but rather about his need for control.   
I also can't help but think that some of the issues he's showing have been present for a while now and I sincerely hope you can emotionally detach yourself from him because from what he did lately he sounds like a really bad partner. Your friends and family probably might have seen some alarming things as well. My friend's relatives and buddies also tried to warn her for a while before she finally got tired of the relentless fights and ""discussions"". I don;t know how relevant this is but in the beginning I suspect she couldn't see the red flags as clearly as the rest of us because she has self-esteem issues.  
I'm glad to see you acknowledge the toxicity and I want to assure you that there is no reason for you to doubt yourself. He's done more than enough to prove he's not a good potential father for your kid.   
Also, refusing to consider you family (his *wife*, that he *married* willingly and aware of her opinion on kids) unless you give him a kid (inappropriate and abnormal request if he knew you're a fencesitter when he married you), being so adamant about the baby's sex (why, would he love the baby less were they not the ""ideal"" gender?) and accusing you of misleading him when he knew for *years* that he's in a committed relationship with a fencesitter, are huge red flags to me and honestly they slightly enrage me because they're  manipulative, whether he's aware of that or not. He could've given you an ultimatum or wait to make sure that you're convinced you want to be a mom (for all of your sakes) or simply resign himself.    


You don't deserve to *live the rest of your life* with a person that makes you doubt yourself so much, let alone tie yourself to him by bringing an innocent baby into the world with him. He doesn't seem to want what's good for you. I'm not saying he wishes bad things for you, but he doesn't actively care about your wellbeing and that's not a relationship anyone should settle for.   


Don't try to unsee what he's been showing you about himself because it would be easier, it will backfire later.

"hlqwqzr","&gt; it's hard af but fun somehow

I'm 38 years old. I remember when the term ""Nintendo Hard"" meant something. 

Your son/daughter just gave the biggest stamp of approval for me that could ever be given to this game. No amount of advertising could come close to that endorsement. 

The idea of playing another game that's Nintendo Hard, is giving me flashbacks to playing Kid Icarus, Mike Tysons Punch out (fuck you Mr Sandman. You license agreement termination ripoff.), and TMNT. Days in the 1980s, being a kid, having all your friends over watching you play. The pressure of not fucking up the TMNT dam level, despite overwhelming evidence that it's impossible. 

Then one day, you beat it. You beat the dam level, and your friends are all sitting in your living room screaming their heads off. Your mom yelling at all of you as a group to keep it down. Completely unaware, and unable to comprehend what just happened in her living room. 

Or the time you FINALLY beat Mike Tyson, and everybody in the house went equally nuts. You'd faced him probably literally thousands of times. If you had a boxing record, you'd look like Glass Joe's little bitch. 1-1854 seems about right for my record. But nobody ever talks about the losses. They talk about how they were there, in my living room, the ONE time I beat Mike Tyson. Then the next day at school everybody who wasn't there refuses to believe it. You have like 10 kids saying they all saw it, and 20 more kids saying it's bullshit. 

I don't think that level of social community exists today. Not only because video games are way easier now, but also because even if you had a difficult one there would be nobody there to see it. Everybody stays at home, and talks on discord, and games from their own living room. The term ""couch multiplayer"" at this point is almost extinct. 

So now I sit here, with grey hair, a small balding spot in the back of my head, reading your 12 year old kid's description of the games difficulty, and thinking to myself ""Oh Yes. James Rolfe gets it. There is zero chance that a retro gamer like him didn't explicitly make the games difficulty this hard."" 

So now I shall be purchasing this game, and wondering if there's any way to reconnect with my neighborhood/school friends from 20+ years ago. I want them to all sit in my basement, and watch as I FINALLY overcome whatever this game's big moment is. 

I would say that they would then carry me on their shoulders, proclaiming me as their king, as they essentially crowd surf me to the local bar.........but I'm 300lbs these days. I don't expect them to lift me like that. 

But maybe they could get one of those chairs, that kings sit on, and then several servants carry as a mode of slow transportation?

And btw, the entire messiah in the old testament is an invention as well, so this is a problem from the get-go.   Archeaology has found the Bible to be embellished storytelling and historical fabrications.  One instance is the book of Daniel with it's many historical mistakes that I pointed out. (This means, by the way, that the Bible has many errors in it.) Additionally, there is zero evidence Moses lived or that over 2 million people wandered around in a desert for 40 years that one can walk the length of in 2 and a half weeks or 3 weeks.   Archaeology also found that YHWH was originally a Canaanite god, one of about 200 different gods the Canaanites worshiped.  As the Canaanites migrated out of the southern Levant area and Hebrew tribes migrated in they adopted YHW as their god.   He was originally a wind and war god and probably also worshiped in the tin mines of Timna as a god of smelting.  He had a consort wife named Asherah. Archaeologists have found small statues of YHWH and Asherah in ancient known Hebrew worship sites.  

So essentially, the Bible is tribal storytelling with an ancient political agenda, written to unite a tribe of people during times of trouble.   Oddly enough, the Biblical god is completely geographical to this particular area on our planet and specifically only concerned with the tribal people who just happened to also write the book about him. Hummm. 

What's even stranger, the Biblical god is totally unaware and ignorant of South America, Australia, Northern Europe, North America, Africa, Japan and all the people who live there.   It's fun to point out that the people who wrote your book claimed the mustard seed was the smallest seed on the planet and in the area the Bible was written this is very true.  However the people writing the book and by an odd coincidence, it's god, seemed to be unaware that an orchid, which only grew in the tropical climates of Asia and South Pacific islands, have the smallest seeds known to man. It's a dust like substance.  Strange that it's god is ignorant about the same specific things as the people who wrote the book.     

I might also point out that all gods in other holy book are geographically centered around the people who just happened to write the book about them as well.

For me it was my mental illnesses and growing up around bad influences but now that I’m an adult and I’ve ran into something at 18 that made me realize how fucked things were I’ve had to grow a lot. I was pretty lax with the med doctors and have found out that normal antidepressants cause me mania so if she wants to get medicated make sure she’s very self aware of what the medicines do to her. I went on taking the meds for 4 years but the whole time they were just making things a lot worse because I just listened to the doctor and didn’t take account for how they actually made me feel. The suicide rates for bipolar are extremely scary and in googles eyes the amount of stress we go through significantly reduces our life expectancy.

Y'all I think I just had the littest practice. This evening I was doing a 1v1 drill with this kid I knew very well, he had tremendous handles and an ever better finish, though today was different(For me that is.), so the drill was to guard the opponent all the way to the post but not attempt to steal the ball. 

Let's just say that he managed to get past me, don't get it wrong he wasn't faster than me parse but he was shifty, the interesting part was when he was right under the rim whilst I was at Half court and I felt this massive wave of concentration hit me as I sprinted and chased him down. He was about to finish it with a layup when all of a sudden I came from beside him and spike the ball out of sight whilst we were both in midair, (yes I said spike referring to Volleyball spiking cause that was the motion in which I hit it in.). That day AKA a few hours ago I felt pretty tall even though I'm 149cm tall. 

Lastly I accidentally hit a three stylishly, we were doing the Question mark drill where you either do Layups or Jumpers but the consequence was that if not all of your teammates hit either one before the timer runs out, you'd be forced to run Suicide runs(you know what those are.)So at first I missed the layup(I can just hear the roasts...) but then when it was time to hit Jumpers was when I shone accidentally, see the Coach but a restriction to our Jumper where we could only shoot from behind the Black line. Me being stupid thought that I was in front of it somehow not aware of the fact that it looked like I decided to flex, but I then hit a wet shot on my first attempt and totally redeemed myself of that trashy layup. I was insecure about my shot because the Coach was right in front of me.

How do I know this? An acquaintance/teammate of my told me what I did in full detail, me unaware and fully oblivious decided to go with it and I just made it look like it was on purpose.

"hkqa4n5","Well i guess we just have different opinion and expectation from the show, for example one of the greatest thing in the show for me was Atsushi's character development and its reference to the real life work

It helps to understand the author and the work that Atsuhi is representing.

The Tiger Poet from The Moon Over the Mountain. It's a story about a man who goes mad, runs into the mountains and turns into a tiger because of his ""cowardly pride"" and his ""arrogant shame"" after he chose to be a politician instead of a poet having failed at writing good poetry even though it's what he wanted to do.

Atsuhi is a representation of a man struggling to find and understand his place in society ultimately giving up and running away because what he's good at isn't what he wants to be. 

[Bungou Stray Dogs Spoilers] &gt;!Atsuhi's arcs are about self acceptance, societal acceptance, and Atsuhi coming to terms with the fact that his transformation, his power, his will to fight is based on a healthy amount of tension between him and society. It's *not* just about letting go of that insecurity, as long as there is injustice in the world you have to be capable of rejecting it and embracing your inner tiger. The paradox is that the mountain tiger is fundamentally fearful, even though it's dangerous and Atsuhi has to resolve his acceptance of both of those tensions. Both his fear and his rage are non-consensual at the beginning of the series (he isn't aware that he's the tiger, the tiger is a transformation, it ""isn't really him""). His trauma isn't a reasonable-fear so it isn't under his control and he's really a very kind person who doesn't want to hurt anyone. In the beginning, he only functions because the boss at the agency suppresses his ability. The most important thing he learns first that lets him control his power a little bit is that other people in society feel what he feels, maybe not his specific trauma, but they're going through their own insecurities and troubles, he doesn't have to be alone. As Atsuhi starts to find his family, and feel societal belonging, he begins to understand that he needs to maintain those inner tensions, feed his tiger, not let it overwhelm him or let himself quash it - now it's about being useful to others and extending to them the opportunity that was given to him in his own way with the power that he has. He's got a couple of arcs, but really it isn't just him repeating the same journey. Each time he gets closer to this understanding which is a long way from where he began, completely unaware and afraid of others, but also himself.!&lt;

I think one of the problems is harvesting or not has always been looked at as “I” thing. If we could get to a point of agreement, looking at it as a “WE” thing would be far more beneficial for the resource. I guess that’s where the regs come in although I know in my state, there is very little decent science behind it and the practices from the state level are even worse. 

I think folks are harsh on harvesting because that’s where we all start, it’s square one, and that deep down is what everyone wants. Everyone wants a tasty meal. And that’s the problem, everyone WANTS for themselves. I guess it’s just a lowest common denominator thing? Not that C&amp;R is some holy mount in the sky but it does align better with selflessness, consciousness, and awareness. The thing is, hanging hats on “what the regs say” is such a weird hill to take a stand on for me. On one hand folks love talking about killing as much as they can and then talk about “conservation” out the other side of their mouth. Just be one way or the other(for me). 

Not that I really said this earlier but I guess the point is like to make is from your statement is 

It’s never just “a person who wants to keep their limit.” It’s tens of thousands of persons who “just want to keep their limits.” Day after day after day.

"hkh22dv","&gt; So now with the second event wish miHoYo is finally getting rid of one of the scummy tactics (Fear of missing out) 

You seem to have missed the entirety of the argument.

No one is complaining about a second banner. EVERYONE is complaining about the lack of a roadmap. 

Everyone has known Itto and Albedo would be on the upcoming banner for the better part of a month. Throwing a surprise Eula into the mix means A) many were caught unaware and unprepared - and won't be able to wish for Eula and B) Eula won't be showing again for another 6 months.

This does NOTHING to alleviate the fear of missing out. Keep in mind, there's been no clear policy on whether the second event wish banner will be regular - or will be one off at MHY's discretion. If anything - this exacerbates the initial complaint: ""We have no roadmap - no idea what's coming up"" - and increases everyone's fear: ""I'm even MORE scared of missing out now.""

"hkeo18o","Yo. Listen.

Are you sure they didn't mean: ""that's **just** their opinion""? As in, it's not an objective truth, just an opinion, and you can't argue someone's opinion away.

If I think chicken wings are gross but you own a chicken wing shop and think they're tops, neither of us can argue the other person's opinion away. I'm still going to see a dismembered chicken's cooked arm and you're still going to see good eatin' and the source of your livelihood. Nothing to argue about. You might be insulted but it's really just the chicken wings I think are gross, not the people who like them.

Going to be honest, your parents sound like they had an immense amount of patience with you and devoted themselves to their marriage and making a family together.

I scrolled through to see if you ever elaborated on what the insults were (nope) and I'm torn between annoyance and being kinda sad for you. It's both, really. 

I'm more sad and annoyed on behalf of your parents, though. You and your sister (dunno if she's your biological sister, but that doesn't matter) were adopted because she couldn't have children. Infertility and vastly different lifestyles can often be deal breakers for couples. But not your parents. He was a farmer and after a brief honeymoon, went to live and work on a farm (sight unseen) and raise two children that needed a loving home. Stayed together for the rest of their lives.

You stayed there with them until you were 38, and I suspect you might be back there at 51, possibly inheriting the place after they both passed. Not sure I blame you because your dad actually sounds awesome. Just like a really great guy. Your mom did stand up for you against a teacher and probably more times than you are aware of.

But you've been on Reddit for years shitting on them and misusing AskReddit. You don't care about other people's responses to questions, you just want to give your own answer. Over and over. But it's the shitting on your parents and their courtship and their treatment of you that I just can't fathom.

They clearly loved you and your sister and each other dearly and you had a really wholesome upbringing. I could almost cry over how unaware and ungrateful you seem.

Ask a foster kid if they'd like to live on a farm with a family. Or a neglected, lonely kid. Don't actually do that, because it'd be cruel if it's just hypothetical. You had fresh air, food and love and shelter and it's heartbreaking that you've hyperfocused on things like being kidded for eating teriyaki on a stick with a fork by family friends or acquaintances.

They didn't stand up for you? You felt like you couldn't stand up for yourself? Well now you're picking on them and they're gone so literally **can't** stand up for themselves, so I will. You're being an unappreciative self-centered hypocrite.

Also, if someone at work says, ""do this"" and you say ""I can't"" or ""I don't know how"" but they want you to do it anyway, it means you need to figure it out. That's what ""you need to learn how to do this"" means. Figure it out because no one is going to willingly do your job for you. If an item is 150lbs but you can only lift 75lbs, don't try to pick it up by yourself. That's not what they're asking for. Get a piece of equipment for the task and use leverage to move it. Honestly, do you think refrigerators are built in people's kitchens, or that the delivery guy just waltzed in carrying a fridge in his arms? The expectation is that you at least try to figure it out.

And finally, those plastic plates were probably not paid for. Someone likely decided they didn't want/need them but it's a self-checkout so no cashier right there to hand them to. So you most likely just stole them from the store. Or if they *were* paid for and in a bag, it's still weird not to put it aside or give it to a nearby employee. It was obviously the last person to use the checkout and how awkward if they'd come back in looking for their plates and you've gone ahead and loaded your items into the same bag.

I don't know why I cared enough to write this but I guess I don't think it's too late for you to realize you had it pretty good and you were loved and you were very important to them. You might have some problems but overall sound pretty well-adjusted in spite of that. You're not meanspirited, at least.

"hkbrbqn","I think labelling him as a narcissist is a bit much, and I do really wish people wouldn't so quickly jump to quite loaded (and significant) psychological labels whenever someone does something they find disagreeable. There is worlds of difference between someone being selfish and someone being an actual proper narcissist. 

His behaviour comes across as selfish, that is reason alone to dump him honestly. He's very curt in his treatment of you and doesn't appear to concerned with ""sparing feelings"". I'd agree he's rude and doesn't appear to care much about how he comes across. If you don't like that about him, dump him.

I disagree he is a potential ""gaslighting narcissist"". Someone going back and explaining what they meant by a term they used is not gaslighting. That is clarification. Gaslighting is when someone makes you objectively question your version of events and things that don't match up with your reality, and denies that reality despite the evidence. Interpretation of a word does not fall into this category because he's not denying what you understood by the word, he's simply expressing what he intended by it (assumedly to try and make his meaning more clear to try and tidy up any misinterpretations).  Gaslighting would be you doing X, him saying Y in response, and then later you ask why he did Y and he denies he did Y at all and possibly denies you doing X as well and tries to have you believe it never happened at all (or redefines what happened). Cross-interpretations, whilst a possible arena for abuse, is not gaslighting unless the person is trying to repaint how you responded to the word ie ""I was hurt when you said that"" ""were you? You didn't seem upset at all, and after I explained you said okay and that you understood?"".

I mean techncially he is right, dating is not an obligation. This lends me to think perhaps he is just socially unaware and blunt. I mean there's technically true, and then there's not being able to read the room. He sounds very bad at reading the room and not considering how what he says might come across to other people, which whilst potentially bad traits, don't make him what you seem to be suggesting.

I do however think your messaging approach in some instances was a bit passive-aggressive. For example bringing up the previous flaw you observed in him and relating it to something a ""bad ex of yours did"" wasn't exactly a brilliant move by you, assuming he apologised and you'd ""moved on from it"". Although your text about cancellations was jokey, if you were annoyed by it, be forthright and state that, and if you weren't, the tone wasn't needed. Your text projected a kinda ""try to guess if i'm annoyed because I won't tell you"" vibe which doesn't lend itself to clear communication. I mean his reply did include an apology for messing you about with that, but you focused on the ""obligation"" part.

In all, I think he is a pretty big jerk and he doesn't sound great for you and you'd have my support in giving him the boot as you don't sound totally compatible. You sound like a more passive communicator who works best with inference and intuition whereas he comes across like a very direct communicator ie ""if I suck tell me, because i'll tell you"". I would urge you however to try and not ""overead"" or ""overanticipate"" what other people are thinking or feeling because when you're doing this rather than taking people at face value, it doesn't appear to be working out amazingly well here. His behaviour has been objectively rude here however and he is definitely the ""bad guy"" and you aren't, so if my post gave you that impression, I apologise.

"hkaudf3","I agree about hating the ""someone is starving in africa"" comparative minimisation bullshit but claiming to have ptsd over what is a very light form of cheating with a guy your still with is alot to handle and I would be severely questioning any possibility of a actual diagnosis.. she can be deppressed and have anxiety and all that but actual ptsd ? 

I believe it could defintly happen from cheating but I would think it would be less about the act and emotional cheating but the lying and manipulation and possible gasslighting that would mess you up.

Also even if cheating counts as trauma and even if something this mild on the cheating spectrum is enough to count as trauma there is alot more to ptsd then just suffering through a traumatic even or being lied to by a partner and experiencing depression, anxiety and mistrust.

If anything in this situation would cause ptsd I imagine it would be the staying with the guy through choice or lack of however if she knows what oop went through and still choose to ""trauma"" dump on her and call it ptsd then that is incredibly fucked up.

I don't do the comparative bullshit on either side but usually with friends that no what I and others have gone through and have struggles themselves  usually find it really hard to see and talk about there trauma or diagnosis because they minimise it themselves and I have to convince them it's okay to be messed up over it and get help and take it seriously and talk about it with others including and maybe especially those who have had it worse in appropriate ways.

Suffering isn't about having it worse then everyone but about going through what isn't okay, 

However not being able to handle people over dramatising minor everyday immature drama (not insulting but it was normal age appropriate drama while I was living a whole different world and it was because I didn't judge I could see it wasn't health for anyone to be around to much and neither could provide support the other needed ) is the reason from a young child I couldn't hang with people my age it would either be young kids in a baby sitting role a few as messed up as me and those in there twenties and thirties+,  I ""aged"" out of being able to be around teenagers from like 14 and I'm only just at 25 being able to connect with my peers.

If she is still suffering from intense and severe ptsd, health struggles and loss of life it defintly isn't appropriate to be around someone who might be a little to self absorbed to see how not the act of sharing her pain but her way of expressing it is causing deep pain .

The other girl might not always be selfish and unaware and she may be genuinely truly suffering over this and need help without exadurating and working through stuff intensely with responsibility in therapy including bringing up other stuff she isn't ready to share but it's not a healthy match for anyone and if there is desire for the friendship to work through it she needs to take it seriously how she is effecting others.",1636695864,"the other girl might not always be selfish and unaware and she may be genuinely truly suffering over this and need help without exadurating and working through stuff intensely with responsibility in therapy including bringing up other stuff she isn't ready to share but it's not a healthy match for anyone and if there is desire for the friendship to work through it she needs to take it seriously how she is effecting others.","selfish and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"selfish and unaware","selfish",NA,NA,0

"hk9knid","It might be controversial to people who are unaware and uneducated in the issues.

**TLDR: the ONLY TWO things that matter are (1) YOU stay alive and remain able to take care of your baby; and (2) your baby stays alive and keeps gaining weight and messing diapers.**

I advocate TRYING to breastfeed, but it's understood that some people might have difficulties, especially if it's your first child.  Some people have difficulties only for a while; some people have continued and permanent difficulties.  I always say to give it your best shot, use all the resources and professionals (specially trained doctors, nurses, lactation consultants, etc.) available to you, etc.  Follow their instructions as best you can.

But in the end, formula feeding is a perfectly valid way to feed your baby until they can wean at about 12-ish months of age.  It is not a failure to be unable to breastfeed.  It is not a failure to choose formula feeding.

Whether it's because someone is a breast cancer/double mastectomy survivor, or they just don't produce breastmilk, Postpartum Anxiety/Depression is involved, or the baby was adopted by two Dads (or one Anderson Cooper Dad), doesn't matter.  Formula feeding is valid and you're not potentially hurting someone else, unlike vaccination.

Shockingly, there are so many things can make breastfeeding impossible.  Historically, when a mother was unable to breastfeed, they would pay for a wet nurse or if they couldn't afford that, their babies just died and they tried again in a few months to conceive another.  It wasn't until we started bottle-feeding with formula that we got our infant mortality rates under control.

There was a time in the early/mid- 1900s when man-made chemical pesticides were used with reckless abandon.  DDT and dangerous chemicals had wound its way into the human food chain, and was found in human breastmilk.  So, people were told to stop breastfeeding.  That was absolutely the right thing to do at the time.

Corporate greed definitely played a part (as it does with many many products) in over-marketing formula to the masses.  So, there was a retaliation to this by over-marketing of breastfeeding and villainizing of formula.  I'm all for public health messaging and marketing campaigns, but some organizations have gotten waaay evil in the pro-breastfeeding direction which is I think what your friends have been subject to.",1636673346,"it might be controversial to people who are unaware and uneducated in the issues.","unaware and uneducated","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and uneducated","uneducated",NA,NA,1

"hk7g3wt","Ah, thanks! I appreciate the examples although I can't really relate. What is interesting here is that you told her what you wanted and she still didn't do it. I like to think I wouldn't do that if someone explicitly told me the problem but I don't know.

I'm curious to hear the same story from her perspective. I think my main problem,  and probably hers as well, is that I'm socially unaware and completely oblivious to the world around me. I also take things at face value instead of trying to pay more attention to what's really going on. I bet her perspective on these situations is quite different, not that it's correct.

 For example, I had a friend who helped me get my job but I ended up on her team and she bitched about how bad her boss was and apologized that I ended up with him, too. But then, once I started my job, she was friendly and kind to the boss. It blew my mind. I never would've guessed she didn't like him from how she was acting to him. I get that he's the boss but it still took me aback. 

I actually distanced myself from her after that because if she was talking behind her bosses back, she probably was talking behind my back too and I didn't want that. Things like this are typical but I have a hard time finding the nuances between fake friendliness and real friendliness until it's too late. Like I'll only notice if it's blatantly obvious but the relationship is usually beyond repair once it gets to that point.

"hjp8xj9","It helps to understand the author and the work that Atsuhi is representing.

The Tiger Poet from The Moon Over the Mountain. It's a story about a man who goes mad, runs into the mountains and turns into a tiger because of his ""cowardly pride"" and his ""arrogant shame"" after he chose to be a politician instead of a poet having failed at writing good poetry even though it's what he wanted to do.

Atsuhi is a representation of a man struggling to find and understand his place in society ultimately giving up and running away because what he's good at isn't what he wants to be. 

[Bungou Stray Dogs Spoilers] &gt;!Atsuhi's arcs are about self acceptance, societal acceptance, and Atsuhi coming to terms with the fact that his transformation, his power, his will to fight is based on a healthy amount of tension between him and society. It's *not* just about letting go of that insecurity, as long as there is injustice in the world you have to be capable of rejecting it and embracing your inner tiger. The paradox is that the mountain tiger is fundamentally fearful, even though it's dangerous and Atsuhi has to resolve his acceptance of both of those tensions. Both his fear and his rage are non-consensual at the beginning of the series (he isn't aware that he's the tiger, the tiger is a transformation, it ""isn't really him""). His trauma isn't a reasonable-fear so it isn't under his control and he's really a very kind person who doesn't want to hurt anyone. In the beginning, he only functions because the boss at the agency suppresses his ability. The most important thing he learns first that lets him control his power a little bit is that other people in society feel what he feels, maybe not his specific trauma, but they're going through their own insecurities and troubles, he doesn't have to be alone. As Atsuhi starts to find his family, and feel societal belonging, he begins to understand that he needs to maintain those inner tensions, feed his tiger, not let it overwhelm him or let himself quash it - now it's about being useful to others and extending to them the opportunity that was given to him in his own way with the power that he has. He's got a couple of arcs, but really it isn't just him repeating the same journey. Each time he gets closer to this understanding which is a long way from where he began, completely unaware and afraid of others, but also himself.!&lt;

It makes a whole lot of sense to me why he gets so much focus, for the main character of a series called Literary Orphans.",1636308237,"each time he gets closer to this understanding which is a long way from where he began, completely unaware and afraid of others, but also himself.!","unaware and afraid","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and afraid","afraid","completely",NA,1
"hjnf0ty","https://www.reddit.com/r/travisscott/comments/qnwig4/dont_take_this_shit_down/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

My point is that there's several videos of him having to pause the event multiple times to help people get help, people standing on top of the ambulances right in front of him and he does nothing. He encouraged people to sneak in with promo videos of people crashing other concerts and tweeting about it. He's literally been warned about this before and had been arrested in relation to it. I highly suggest you check out his subreddit. 

Yeah he may not have realized people were dying, but it is very clear something was wrong. There's plenty if other concerts where artists spot and hear things happening and stop the show to call it out. He is no different. Obviously it isn't specifically him though, it's his whole team, everyone who planned the event. They didn't have adequate barriers to keep people back. They didn't have proper security or medical staff. Nobody did anything to stop people from impeding ambulances. People liter blue in the face and dead on the floor while others continued dancing. Pictures of human bodies stampeded and piled up on each other, looking dead or passed out. 

It seems to me he didn't care about people looking like they were in distress and the numerous medical incidents happening. Since many performers have shown they can spot this stuff and stop the show, I don't know why he wouldn't have been able to tell people to leave the ambulance alone it to just wait until the ambulance was gone before starting another song. He literally said he wants to feel the floor shake and started another song while an ambulance wad trying to make it's way through the crowd. An ambulance he paused the show to point out. There's also videos of people clearly waving their arms in distress, not in a normal way. Like look at the videos it's undeniable. He paused the concert at some point to point out a dude in a tree and you can hear people screaming that they're drowning and in pain. Yeah I'm not sure if he could hear what people are screaming...but how did nobody managing the camera feed do anything? You can clearly hear their voices saying explicitly they're in pain and need help. 

Crowd crush is a normal issue to plan for. Idk how they were like, unaware and so unprepared? Multiple accounts if people saying they were brushed off when asking for help. Anyway, Travis is a professional, this is his brand, his show, he should have stopped at obvious moments like people dancing on the ambulances and to let the EMTs do their job at the very least. He also probably should have learned from previous warnings here been given and common sense should have let him know that encouraging the fans to stampede the place would only lead to problems. People brushing off those asking for help, the lack of security, the lack of proper medical staff, the promo videos of crashing past events, etc, is on his team and the event planners. Which he's still involved with, but not as much.

In the end I do think he's personally partially at fault here. I feel bad for him though, I don't think it was malicious, I think he was being dumb and now people are dead. Hopefully he learns from this and can make changes to how he runs things he can control, like bring able to stop the show and tell off the crowd for dancing on ambulances and demanding security that will be able to control the crowd better and do what he needs when he asks then to. At one point he had to call for security to crowd surf a dead girl (bit obviously dead though to be fair) and he's calling for them several times. They should have been there right away and the crowd surfing aspect of it should not have been necessary. There's a certain level if professionalism he can demand to have that wouldn't include nonsense like that happening.",1636270419,"idk how they were like, unaware and so unprepared?","unaware and so","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and so unprepared","unprepared",NA,"so",1

In the words of Jorja Smith “if you can feel the pain, then you know you’re alive” so many people walk around carrying suffering in their hearts and traumas never spoken. Completely unaware and completely unconscious.
Unable to break free because of the paralysation that pain causes. These people create more pain from the seat of their own un realised pain. And so the cycle begins. Where hurt people, hurt people, and in turn, hurt people. 
My own spiritual awakening did not start until I experienced a succession of painful events which thrust me into a position where I was forced to heal and accept pain, and in turn accept light and divinity. 

A tree cannot grow up to heaven, unless it’s roots reach down to hell. This is not just earth duality, and an unfortunate circumstance which inconveniences our experience. But a necessary condition to accepting and understanding the nature of the universe. 
Pain and suffering exists on the frequency that is equal and opposite to our divinity as beings of light. Earth teaches us that.

I had a brief….thing….with someone who I believe strongly was on the spectrum and was emotionally/psychologically abusive. The way he spoke about himself it’s like he knew but never said it out loud.  he used it as an excuse for his behaviour, like it was ok somehow? I felt like he didn’t know any better and I tried so hard to understand his behaviours. Ultimately it was traumatic for me.

My mom was abusive too. She had tantrums, she beat us, all the things. I repressed all of this until I started to go to therapy. It’s been painful and eye-opening. I think she is completely unaware. Maybe she knows she is different somehow but I don’t know. What do I excuse? What’s ok and what isn’t? I’m still working through those feelings and it’s confusing.

Something I read, or that my therapist maybe said to me was that we are allowed to grieve what we could have had. We are allowed to grieve the fact that we didn’t have supportive parents, or that we didn’t have the right supports or guidance. It hurts to know these things and it’s ok to grieve them.

They explore and discover something is not right. I'm dropping huge hints that theres something wrong, they should really tell the others, maybe get some guards.

I tried to keep the word count down, but this still clocks in at just over 2,000 words. I didn't want to sacrifice substance for brevity, and I couldn't think of a meaningful way to divide it into two entries. I wanted this scene well described, and Travis's perspective, both as passenger and victim, to be fully explored.

I considered cutting the introduction with Liz out, but I didn't want to drop the reader in unaware and unprepared. I also wanted the reader to (hopefully) catch the tense change from the intro to the body of the story. My goal was to illustrate where Travis's mind is currently, in this case, he *is* with Liz, not *was* with her.

I knew setting out that Travis and Scott would fail here. I've been mulling over this scene since I started writing these entries back in September, and couldn't bring myself to let them win. It all happens too suddenly and too quickly, the events too powerful and unknown. I didn't want to degrade the stakes I set up, so Scott was basically doomed to start.

It hurt to write the story of what happened in room 313. I knew it was a father-daughter scene, and it would come back to the same rage Travis was susceptible to, but I never imagined it would play out the way it did, at least not until I was writing it. I found myself avoiding even thinking about it until I sat down to write it.

Seeing as how NaNoWriMo is going on, I'm thinking about expanding this story out, either with Travis attempting the room again, having the benefit of knowing what to expect now, or by telling the same story from other perspectives, i.e. Scott's or Otto's or Lucy's perspective (spoiler, Lucy and little Alice have their own story waiting in the wings.)",1636134333,"i considered cutting the introduction with liz out, but i didn't want to drop the reader in unaware and unprepared.","unaware and unprepared","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unprepared","unprepared",NA,NA,1

"hjc8rhx","Here's my two cents:

If it was Jacob there's two options. Either he did it consciously or he did it unconsciously, in the way that he could've been under the influence of a prescription medication like Ambien (like one Reddit user commented below the post). Ambien apparently has a lot of side-effects, sometimes causing the user to do activities while sleeping. This post is a very interesting read discussing ""Ambien Zombies"" that airlines have to deal with: [https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/planes-sleeping-pills/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/planes-sleeping-pills/index.html)  


If it wasn't Jacob, the OP must've been lying and fabricated the story for whatever reason. I think that's possible but unlikely. OP has been an active redditor for a long time and still actively participates in a multitude of pages. There's no record of OP being a known troll. OP also posted a screen recording of a supposed conversation she had with a friend in 2018 right after the plane landed, in which she identified Jacob. Reportedly they also saw Jacob's name on his boarding pass.

I've also messaged OP about the situation. According to them, Jacob was laid stretched out across 3 chairs trying to sleep for the most of the flight. This makes sense if you look at the dates, since he had flown around quite a bit of the world, and was now on another plane on his way to LA. The idea of him taking something like Ambien, being uninhibited and unaware and doing something like this is very possible.

To end off, I don't think Jacob is the type of person to actively/consciously do this. Of course we don't know him through and through, but from what most of us have seen he's usually a very kind, supportive and upbeat soul. 

TL;DR: If Jacob, he might've been under the influence of a drug.

**""Present data suggest that apparent hypothalamic hypothyroidism occurs perhaps as an adaptation to prolonged starvation""**

The specific number of calories are relative to each individual. 

&gt; as a smaller person, you legitimately don’t need as many calories.

It's not an opinion. You know that right? Just because you feel like you only need 900 calories, doesn't mean that's true. This is an eating disorder. 1200 is the minimum needed for an elderly short thin sedentary woman in coma for her vital organs to keep running. What makes you think 1200 is enough for a healthy active woman?

&gt;I am a smaller person (TDEE ~1500) and need to lose about 25 pounds to get back to where my body felt best and I felt confident in it.

At 5'3 110lbs (which I am assuming is close to your goal weight), your TDEE is just shy of 1500 calories *sedentary*. This means your body needs 1500 calories if you were to lay in bed all day. 1200 is malnutrition. Eating 1200 calories to create a ""300 calorie deficit"" is incorrect thinking, it's incorrect perspective, and it's incorrect behavior. You should be eating between 1500-1600 calories AND exercise. Go on two 30 minute walks per day. Hit 10k steps. Then the 25lbs will come off effortlessly. You won't be losing 1lb per week, *but you're not supposed to*. That's the point. You don't have that kind of wiggle room to cut food so little.

**A 4'8 85lb sedentary female has a TDEE of 1210 calories**. You are not 4'8, you are not 85lbs. You are 5'3 and the TDEE if you weighed 110lbs would be 1500 calories. That is nowhere close to 1200 calories. How do you not understand this very basic math?


&gt;I would say thought that it really isn’t that hard to get all the nutrients that you need into that amount of calories

LOL, have you even seen some of the full day of eating posts? Just run them into cronometer. **None of them even meet 1/2 the MINIMUM daily vitamin/mineral requirements**. None. Most of them are filled with pre-packaged junk that is void of any substantial nutrition.

You claim you did all of it for him and his happiness, and even though you come off as self-absorbed and sanctimonious, that would’ve been at least somewhat believable. You could be a caring, sweet girlfriend who just happens to be pretty self-involved, tactless, and ignorant. People like that exist- I know one of them! But that facade lost all of what little credibility it had when you complained that your boyfriend’s reaction “ruined the mood” of the party. 

You’re not just selfishly upset that he didn’t react to your effort in a happy manner, you’re upset that your (your, not his) party was interrupted and the guests might’ve seen you as a bad host since things got awkward and the vibe suffered. You didn’t throw the party w/ his true feelings in mind, you threw it thinking of how wholesome his reaction would be and how it would make the guests coo over what a great girlfriend you are. You wanted to “go all out and create amazing memories,” but you cared more about the memories of you and your guests than your boyfriend. 

It’s evident from the way your guests reacted, which is a dead giveaway that most of them weren’t your boyfriend’s loved ones. I’m sure you invited your friends and family who are part of the big party tradition. Had most of the guests been his loved ones, they probably wouldn’t have continued to party like nothing happened. They likely would’ve checked on him and apologized. If they were invited, at least a few of them would’ve advised against throwing the surprise party- the buddy your boyfriend is now staying w/ certainly would’ve. I hesitate to say maybe the party wouldn’t have happened had you invited his loved ones, as you probably would’ve ignored their concerns and gone through w/ it anyway.

"hiy24rq","I am flattered that you would compare my writing to tabloids when self-media are considered to be on an even lower rung of the ladder, though I was admittedly surprised that your comment was visible in the first place when Reddit itself typically has spam filters in place to remove such low-quality links. However if you are that unaware of their trashiness to the point that you have to put my statements in quotes, then you are truly out of the loop on 国情 or even the treatment of 国动 and have no idea why the Chinese government is even cracking down on their KPI-focussed peddling of disinformation, at which point further discussion is mostly rendered moot.

This extends to the rest of your post, where my comfort with omitting some nuance under the assumption that you would know upon doing the barest of digging around is astonishingly challenged because you demand hard evidence for what should be common knowledge and won't take collective memory as answers. I've received feedback from people who were more-or-less total strangers to certain subjects before, but expected more from someone presenting themselves as knowing about the show but somehow turned out to be ultimately unaware and rejecting of the discourse surrounding it, along with the unallergic reaction to the FMA post or unironic blaming of myself for AHA locking down their accounts and therefore primary sources so severely [after backlash](/r/Donghua/comments/hrnx4e/). They've made [comparisons to Kenshin](https://weibo.com/5531567877/Gd9QQpLdY) for years now and ""Killer Seven"" itself has parallels to ""Rurouni Kenshin"" in Chinese, but the reversals came at a time that happened to coincide with the season that is actually supposed to get to the point about what led to season 1, even when He has repeatedly claimed that he already got the entire story planned out (hoping this is well-known enough to not require verification).

And it's frustrating to have to go meticulously over things like the Zhongyuan and internal politics (Alibaba!!) as if you are ignorant about the CCP's claims about its unity, the campaign of self-sabotage that has persisted for most of the CCP's existence, and how it will supposedly never budge on its red lines (notice that there's no dashed lines either), which turned out to be surprisingly flexible... almost like it's making fun of what the government says it's like compared to what it actually is like... and how cultural relativism isn't considered a thing and sinicization is demanded... or that it's ***mostly Jiang that exists in your imagination*** considering the deletion of her plot. Notice also the geographical impossibility of Duomao being so tiny above Xuanwu, but the slur certainly suggests it is Russia. Also lol at socialism with Chinese characteristics, agree that Xuanwu should have been depicted as socialist because the China irl is so hypercapitalist, though you've likely fallen for other lies and revisionism, haven't read the news about India and whatnot, and just didn't bother to process the lampshading of China's imperialism as it tries to remind people that's it's a century behind in its imitation. But if you're drinking the kool-aid, at least drink it completely - it's very much not in character of you to consider things out of Japan to be so disgraceful when it's unspoken policy to be hardest on other ""勾罕见"" knowing that they can't do much to non-Chinese, so if you want to come across like a true believer, of course you'd have to pretend to be enraged over 567 much more than DB. However I would personally suggest viewing the CCP as the real traitors with their enabling of the 'War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression' through sabotage of KMT forces and lack of participation, since caring more for infighting is in character after all. But if not, consider this sad piece of history sourced similarly to your own: unlike the Rape of Nanking at Japanese hands which still had survivors, Larin recalled that Russia had completely wiped out all the Chinese inhabitants of Haishenwai at around the same time, and they continue to shamelessly flaunt their possession of Vladivostok to this day. If your desire for consistency is so great that the CCP keeping mum about such a horrific event informs your understanding that no genocide occurred that year, then I have nothing to say about your stance that there was no genocide in Xinjiang either, since your heart is evidently with the party and not the people getting erased and forgotten.

To circle back, I am not even sure why you are so sensitive to the extent that an aside to respond to your original aside is suddenly a sign of being triggered. I've offered a number of actual examples of homaging, yet you are still trying to derail the original post with irrelevance because you simply cannot seem to make the distinction between homages and ripoffs, I'll now raise a better example of Naruto or Boruto when all that's in DB is its excessive use of banks, but ""Japan copying Hollywood"" again veers quite far from ""Chinese creators ripping off and oppressing each other"" as I have said. So on that note, you also managed to be unaware of Bilibili's penchant for deleting content that makes bad press and have accidentally committed victim blaming - not only was Pddg_'s posts deleted in a day, even comments from watchers mentioning him under other videos were deleted by moderators. You also seem to be unaware of who [Li Xiejun](https://weibo.com/2260872235/KDTQpwkEu) is and what he had to do with storyboards, since you are actually doubting the authenticity of this vx interface (which has never been debunked, unlike, say, Kris Wu's faked chats) when he is already known as someone in industry. Thankfully, I did mention keeping receipts for that one time, and [further screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/6RP0H2v) taken before the deletion certainly do indicate suspicious levels of similarities with Pddg_'s work that LX would want to pressure into being blasted into oblivion. Naturally, you could further argue that Scissor Seven fanartists were not *really* being silenced based on the technicality of AHA walking back their threats, or Ren Yuan [deleting his posts](https://weibo.com/5680439273/Kz0dH6t3J) must mean he *really* did it of his *own* volition, but that either suggests true stubbornness at reading between the lines or such a lack of shared understanding that I could be 耳旁风 for all the typing.

Well there's that, other than the weird tangents, glad that we are on the same page about how unacceptable Scissor Seven is with its treatment of other creators and works all this time, and keeping my fingers crossed that He can break out of the corner he forced himself into so that the fourth season doesn't actually end up axed with how the issues have snowballed with his risky commentary (...and i haven't even gotten to the pedophilia yet!).",1635808917,"i've received feedback from people who were more-or-less total strangers to certain subjects before, but expected more from someone presenting themselves as knowing about the show but somehow turned out to be ultimately unaware and rejecting of the discourse surrounding it, along with the unallergic reaction to the fma post or unironic blaming of myself for aha locking down their accounts and therefore primary sources so severely [after backlash](/r/donghua/comments/hrnx4e/).","unaware and rejecting","unaware","and",FALSE,"ultimately unaware and rejecting","rejecting","ultimately",NA,1

It’s a compounding and self perpetuating issue because of how bad the average/typical player is and how unaware and unapologetic they are about it.

Since there’s no real point in messaging/talking after the game if the win is what you’re concerned with, it makes more sense to address it early and provide them with the awareness they lack. 

The thing with this is, even as someone prone to have a bad start here and there, it doesn’t happen unless you’re actually bad. That’s the part that gets lost in all the negativity. It’s a valid take and legitimate criticism an overwhelming majority of the time.

My ex actually had a similar mentality and I’m here to tell you now that things won’t get better. He would wait with me if we were out late, but he had absolutely no understanding of why I felt unsafe in the first place which was absolutely mind-boggling to me. He only waited with me because I told him to, but he still didn’t understand *why*. We ended up having many arguments about this and it turns out that he had no understanding of any of the shit that women go through. He was even offended when I told him that as a woman, I will never feel as safe as he does as a man. He said, “well, I could still get mugged or attacked”. I was absolutely speechless. Like yeah, of course that could happen, but I’m female, much smaller than you and have nowhere near as much physical strength as the average man so how the hell do you think I feel? I just know that he’d be the type to say “not all men” and would have absolutely no idea why a woman could feel unsafe in the presence of a man, especially when alone late at night with no one around to protect you.

I am reaching my 30s &amp; went through a lot of trauma from others that it caused me to be an extreme introvert that it caused me to stop &amp; look back and self-reflect and so I taught myself self awareness &amp; self love.

If I compared myself to who I was last year, I definitely changed because I learned from my traumas and I am really proud of who I am today compared to the hot mess I was last year, because I had no self respect or self love growing up.

I  feel I didn't change much externally, but I think it is normal for INTP's to be in their heads a lot. I think mental wealth is important though so maybe you should work on that.

"hfsk8xb","Hey personally I appreciate you reaching out and asking for clarification and wanting to understand things better. Personally I don't agree with the downvotes you're getting.  I thick its great you want to find out more and are curious which I welcome.  

Now I want to answer your questions with what I've concluded and gathered after having thought about all this and experienced in my life.  Also sorry this reply is so long.  

The solution isn't simply lay down and die.  Yes we want extinction but by the way you phrase it, it makes it sound worse than it really is.  We want to end suffering and create peace which you should know is impossible to achieve as long as live exist (especially humans).  Humans are always going to want more, we as a species can never have enough so we will always want more and this desire will lead to suffering. But again that's not to say we want to just lay down and die.  Personally I want to keep living and make the most of what I've been dealt in life.  I have desires and dreams of my own and I personally want to live a decently long life (although it can feel overwhelming at times thicking about living too long and dealing with all these thoughts of how horrible the world truly is but I'm working through it). We don't advocate for suicide, we simply just don't want more poeple coming into existence to experience the harshness of reality.

Humanity has grown and improved for thousands of years and yet there is still so much suffering in the world right now.   No matter how much we grow and improve, we will never be able to fully get rid of suffering. So long as we are alive there will always be pain around the corner.  Pain and suffering is impossible to completely wipe out unless you're plan is to just have your brain hooked up to a machine that keeps you locked in a dream world where you're basically God but at that point is that really living?  There will always be conflict so long as humans desire which is something we can't get rid of.  We all can't just come together and understand one another and live in harmony, that's a fairy tail dream and if you truly believe that's achievable than you are fooling yourself. And let's just say for arguments sake it is achievable one day in the future. How many more people have to suffer until we reach that point?  Are you ready to sacrifice your children, great grandchildren, and great great grandchildren just so those great great great grandchildren can experience unless inconvenience and suffer than we are now? What does that say about your character if your wiling to being in your own children into suffer for people who don't even exist now?

Reach out for the stars huh?  Yeah okay so we can invade another planet and drain it of all its resources and slowly kill it like we are doing to earth?  See that's you not really thinking through what you're saying.  You assume just because we reached the stars and can travel across galaxies that we somehow are better and happier?  Except no, it just proves how hungry we as a species are to expand and drain more from the universe because of our desire. How exactly does resching the stars make us better or happier as a species?  It only expands our area of effect which as our history shows is mostly destruction.  We will also be expanding the amount of suffering in the universe.  Do you really think that if we find other creatures similar to us that we will just get along and live happily ever after?  No it only means more wars and conflict. We can't even get along with ourselves, let alone aliens.  And thus we have expanded suffering to another set of life forms. 

Solving the problem is impossible as I've stated before. You really need to open your eyes to the harsh reality of the situation we as living entities have been put into.  I know thinking about all the horror in the world is not something we like to think about and that's natural but that's your brain tricking you because otherwise we'd go insane. This is why more poeple are becoming depressed in this day and age. Because we have access to so much information online that allows us to see all sides of the world and experience horrors that we would have otherwise not known about if we kept to ourselves.

 Look up the subreddit r/natureismetal.   I use to ignorantly think nature was beautiful and wonderful.  And Yay some animals ate each other but it was the cycle of life.  But that subreddit has shown me the true reality of what nature is. It's unforgiving, it's callus, it's unempathetic, it's horrible the things these creature have to go through.  Worse part is they are completely unaware and ignorant of the greater picture.  They breed off instinct without a second thought to the horror of what might await their young.   Well we are aware and I believe we can do better than them. We need to fight these primordial instincts to breed so we don't end up throwing new life into the gualet of suffering that is life itself.

And I know you might be thinking, dang this guy sounds depressed and down and must have a horrible life.  I don't actually.  I have a decent life.  I go to college, I work in at a job that I enjoy and makes a difference in people's lives, and I still manage to find time to socialize and have fun with friends on the weekends.  I'm a healthy individual with no health concerns.  I work out consistently and work on my own personal passion projects like making terrain, board games, cosplay etc (you can see in my post history).   All this while still whole heartily believing everything I have stated here. 

So I please ask that you think much harder about life and expand your perspective beyond your comfort zone. Don't remain ignorant and blind to the true reality of the universe like animals do. We can be better than them and do what's right.  The only true path to peace is voluntary extension.

"hf1i9qx","Based on my own experiences and on reading, I'm gradually buying into the idea that men and women (in the subcultures that I occupy) tend to have somewhat different ""languages"" and conventions, specifically around unwritten boundaries for emotional openness.

When I'm around close male friends, I can express my emotional state and frustration at them in a way that feels safe because it's predictable. I have a sense of how deeply they'll pry in response to whatever I say. I know what level of irony to sigh with to signal that I'm venting, but that I'm not trying to start A Real Conversation about the topic. And I have some trust that if my friends pry too deep, they'll pick up on relevant signals and back off, possibly even before I pick up on those signals. I don't have the same trust with women generally, and I don't think that's ""just stereotypes"".

As it happens, I have that kind of relationship with my close women friends too. But based on what I'm reading, I get the sense that those friendships follow somewhat ""masculine"" conventions. (I don't know if those same friends follow more ""feminine"" conventions with their female friends.)

I do think these conventions result in different typical ""emotional distances"", and I do sometimes wish the default wasn't what it is. I could probably use more explicit emotional openness in my life, and it would be nice if it was already on the table without me having to swim upstream and convince my friends to swim upstream.

But I think the coarse idea that women are emotionally aware and close and men are emotionally unaware and distant doesn't tell the real story.

&gt;Not sure if that is the perfect explanation for that, but it's a common feature that you find in these groups that they do start out as a social club with some support systems before they show their true colors.

In regards to modern California street gangs that date as far back as the 1940s, what are you basing this belief on?

&gt;Now it's debatable whether it's a transistion from the one to the other or whether the social club thing was a front to begin with to lure in people and avoid the authorities looking to closely into it, but again it's apparently a side that is present in many extremist organizations.

In regards to street criminal organizations in in the United States, be it Bloods, Crips, Hispanic gangs or Cosa Nostra, what examples do you have that they started out as mere social club fronts?

&gt;Whereas the entertainment industry just wants to make money. I mean Disney sells space fascism to little children (stormtrooper plushies) so do you expect that industry to have any moral standards when it comes to making money?

It's clear that most of society expects the entertainment industry to have *some* degree of moral standards which is why Disney doesn't sell KKK or Charles Manson plushies. We don't have porn on network television. Movies have restricted ratings.

&gt;I mean being racist is an aggrevating factor. If you're a criminal you're an asshole to individuals, if you're a racist you're an asshoole to larger groups of people in general. So yeah the impact of being an asshole is bigger.

In my entire life in California, I don't know anyone personally who has been murdered by white racists or white supremacists. Sadly, I personally do know a number of people who have been murdered as a result of gang violence.

You're saying that criminal organizations and gang violence is a lesser impact. What are you basing this on?

&gt;Though showcasing and promiting are two different things. For example you've got the problem of the impossibility to making an anti-war movie without making a pro-war movie...

This analogy doesn't even work and I'm surprised you're using it again, since we're discussing actual gang members who are promoting their gang and gang violence in a positive, and romanticized fashion.

You have people like Cardi B admitting that she still represents her gang in her music, and promoting it in every aspect of her life.

It's pointless that you keep going back to this well, since it's been established several posts ago that the particular performers I'm referring to are not using their medium to merely showcase different life situations.

&gt;And you have a tendency to use bad examples that you think are one but could also be read as the other.

None of the examples I provided are ""bad,"" and the fact that you insist they can be read in a way that's *not* romanticizing their gang seems to be demonstrating an intentional and defiant ignorance,

Anybody that saw the numerous examples provided of Cardi B openly promoting a violent, criminal organization and still walks away arguing she's merely showcasing ""life in the ghetto"" is intentionally being dishonest. Either that or they are so out-of-touch with reality they must be a danger to themselves. Like, how would someone go through life being *that* naive?

&gt;Protested? Definitely. Condemned? Well unless you want to shoot people you still need to offer them some exit strategy, don't you?

But you seem to be against protesting art based on it being art. Except when it's racist apparently. And we both know that condemning someone's unrepentant actions doesn't involve ""shooting"" anyone. D.W. Griffith was unrepentant and defiant about pushing forward with this film *Birth of a Nation*. You yourself were claiming he was an associate of the Ku Klux Klan with an agenda. You're not going to make change with these type of people by being soft and sugar coating your words.

**condemn**/kənˈdem/*verb*express complete disapproval of, typically in public;

So for someone against arguing semantics, it seems like you're engaging in it here.

&gt;Yes but apart from that you also have gangs (read groups) of teenagers who aren't in organized crimes but just hang out and annoy the adults and to a conservative audience the two can often be conflated when that couldn't be more wrong.

You're yet again moving the goal post. In the previous posts I was clear in speaking specifically on **gang members** and the severity of their criminal activity and you responded with:

*""You wildly mix teenagers hanging out with other teenagers because they've nothing better to do and who pretend to be tougher then they are to be accepted in a hostile environment with career criminals. The thing is if a few teenagers can form a gang, it's likely not comparable to a Cosa Nostra chapter either...You can't have your cake and eat it too.""*

Again, I corrected you on this because you were obviously completely unaware and ignorant to how serious, violent and sophisticated street gangs, including their teenaged members are.

There was no mention made of ""groups of teenagers"" who buy and wear rappers ""merch"" and just ""hang out"" to annoy adults and conservatives. But now you bring that up as a strawman argument.

You seem to be intentionally deflecting at this point.

&gt;No that's not the point. You should absolutely protest it and cancelling celebrities for their real life bullshit is a good thing.

Except, for multiple posts now, you've been going to elaborate lengths to defend and excuse the inexcusable. You haven't given the impression that these particular people should be protested or cancelled.

&gt;Though that's a double edged sword and far too often it's also used to silence people just in general. Then any rapper becomes a gang member and whatnot.

Anything can become used in the wrong way and abused. That goes without saying. We're speaking about a very specific situation of performers openly promoting violent criminal organizations.

Butwhatabout...is not productive in this case.

It's like making the (morally correct) argument that we need to speak out against, protest and boycott prominent YouTubers who are using the platform to blatantly promote white nationalism (ex Lauren Suthern, Miloe, etc) and then someone chiming in with, *yeah, bad people should be called out but lets not be hasty because too often protests and boycotts are used to silence people in general, more than any YouTuber becoming a white nationalist.*

&gt;And the other problem is that, while certainly tempting, arguing against something and generating attention for it might help it more than it hurts it.

While that can be an effect (The Streisand Effect), this is usually a cop out, and an excuse to do nothing. No one argues that speaking out against racism, sexism, rape culture, etc results in popularizing it more. But when it comes to other things, suddenly it's best no to give it more attention?

&gt;So it often makes more sense to do something productive and push the things that you want to see in the world than to push against something else and make that the pressing issue.

I'm curious, why do you continue on insisting that you can only do one thing or the other, never both? It's already been brought up how ""society"" pushed against something and it resulted in change (Roseanne Barr, Paula Deen, The Dixie Chicks, etc).

So obviously it can result in change. Usually the people who are advocating what you just did, usually do that because they don't want to look unpopular, ""old,"" unhip, prudish, prejudice, etc.",1632721926,"*  again, i corrected you on this because you were obviously completely unaware and ignorant to how serious, violent and sophisticated street gangs, including their teenaged members are.","unaware and ignorant","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and ignorant","ignorant","completely",NA,1
"hefsjw0","Minister of Justice Maria, who, ironically, has a string of murder cases with her as the prime suspect, seven years of unpaid taxes, and various other crimes on her record, upon finding out about the Legion's presence in the Imperial Federation's capital city, decides that she is going to flee the planet altogether, no, the solar system, and finally go to check out that tropical island on a distant planet in the Ruznov Union she purchased a few years ago.

Chief Warrant Officer Ada Hawks is completely unaware of the Legion's existence, having just woken up at her estate in Windrise Plains

General Nora Wolfe, known as the *'Tödliche Schönheit'* for her habit of draining her enemies (and sometimes even innocent civilians from enemy civilizations), is, like her fellow vampire Maria, quite concerned for her safety. Regardless, she refuses to be a coward like the overly cautious Maria (who is actually her sister-in-law), and calmly loads her personal handgun *Kopfjäger*, as she takes refuge in her heavily-guarded manor in the midst of Amberwood Castle's wealthiest neighborhoods.

The Elite Guard officers, who are far worse than Maria, having been behind mass genocides of hostile species and even fellow humans, are unfazed, choosing to recline in their downtown skyscraper and rest for the week. They fight with their superior on a regular basis and *he* could annihilate planets with a flick of his finger should he wish.

The High Regent is, meanwhile, something between unaware and ignorant of the Legion's arrival in the capital city of Anthos on the eastern coast. He believes that a great force will arrive, and awaits their arrival in his residence.

(Anthos is on the east coast BTW, Maria is at the spaceport in the city waiting for her starship, Hawks is in the far east region well over 4000 kilometres away, Wolfe is in the Great Forest region in the northwest about 2500 kilometres away, and the Elite Guard is in downtown Anthos. The High Regent is at his estate on a private island within the city's bay, accessible via a single bridge.)

(The Legion starts on the outer shores of the city, across the river; they have to cross the only bridge to enter the city by foot, as crossing by water is not feasible due to the number of actively aggressive naval drones and warships, and it is currently afternoon rush hour.)",1632718678,"the high regent is, meanwhile, something between unaware and ignorant of the legion's arrival in the capital city of anthos on the eastern coast.","unaware and ignorant","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and ignorant","ignorant",NA,NA,1

"hedwg5b","I'm the other guy.

&gt;but there has never been a universal understanding of what is moral and what isn't, 

I'm going to say you're exactly right again. I'm going to point out that morality, can't be an ""is"" because it's an invented thing. Everything that we declared to be either right or wrong is a function of declaration.

Now I'm going to attempt to tell you where it comes from. This isn't something to believe this is something to check out for yourself.

There's a toddler we start to figure out that it's good to feel good and it's bad to feel bad.

There comes a time when you experience feeling bad, and for the first time, it bothers you. In that moment you choose a way of being that allows you to overcome this experience of feeling bad. Everybody goes through this.

Then as a young teenager you start to figure out that it is good to be good and it is bad to be bad. You figure out also, that it's good to associate yourself with things that look good and bad to associate you so with things that look bad. This is built on top of feeling bad.

And then that comes a point at which you look bad in some sort of a social setting. And in that moment you declare and decide to choose a survival method that allows you to overcome this horrible experience. And just like your decision to overcome feeling bad, these survival methods that you've chosen will stay with you the rest of your life.

And finally as a young adult you start to figure out that it is good to be wise and aware and it is bad to be unwise and unaware. And you'll spend the rest of your life trying to figure this one out. As circumstances and situations change in our life, we have to make constant adjustments that makes this a real challenge.

And it comes a point at which we discover that we are not wise enough or aware enough. And we make a profound declaration in our life that changes how we survive life. 

Each one of these steps starts around the age of 4. And each takes about 7 years to fully develop. It is one of the reasons why psychologists don't think fully cooked until a 25 years old. It's one of the reasons why we see a full personality has developed around the age of 25.

What were left with is it clear understanding that your body desires to make sure that it feels good, looks good and is wise and aware. Because your body has figured out that the more it feels bad, looks bad and it's being unwise and unaware, the closer to death it is.

And this could be imagined threats to these three main desires. Or it can be actual threats to these three main desires. The body doesn't distinguish between the two. Real or imagined. 

Every unwanted bad feeling, every unwanted looking bad moment. And every moment where we can see that we're being unwise and unaware in an unwanted way, we declare to be a bad wrong and or evil thing. And along with this declaration brings out a survival strategy that you've been working on your whole life.

Everything that supports your desire to feel good, look good and be wise and aware, you will call good. And you will support it, nurture it, and hope it stays around.

All ideas of what is moral comes from these experiences. And because each individual has their own experience and has drawn their own conclusions... Every idea we have of what is moral is individual.

And of course it's an overlap. The general consensus is I don't want to be murdered. I don't want to be physically harmed. I don't want to be raped. I don't want my sister to be raped I don't want my mother to be raped I don't want my aunt to be raped. So all of these obvious harms, as a consensus are considered bad, wrong and Evil.

I could go on. But I think I'm done explaining.

I think you get the point.

If Christians want to make the claim that God and his ideas constitute objective morality. I'm fine with that.

But the reality is, is that everything that a human claims to be moral, is only based on our experiences. Which are completely subjective. And have nothing to do with any objectivity.

I've never met anybody who can separate their own personal wants in such a way that they're able to objectively make a claim of any individual thing that can be claimed to be either good or bad. There's always a personal want involved.

Okay I'll say one more thing...

The rub to all of this morality talk. 99% of the time, when we do something wrong. We knew it was wrong before we did it, we knew it was wrong while we were doing it. And we knew it was wrong after we did it.

Declaring something right or wrong within ourselves, never keeps Us from doing a bad thing. And we sure don't always do the right thing. It would be absurd to think that we do.

And because these three desires and the survival strategies are not like on and off switches but more like dials that you can turn up and turn down. When we are fighting faced with life's circumstances and are thrown into situations that are relatively new to us, we will go through a negotiation with ourselves to find out who's going to win.

If I offer you $100 to run around the neighborhood naked for 10 minutes... You're going to weigh the benefits of being wise to take the free money up against the embarrassment of looking bad.

On Facebook yesterday I saw a question... Would you sell your favorite pet for $250,000? My instant answer was of course I would. It's a $50 cat. That I love with all my heart. But it's going to be dead in 5 years. And $250,000 in my world changes my entire life. And I wasn't surprised to see so many answers for people said there was no way they would do that. They couldn't bring themselves to go through that level of pain. The desire to make sure they did not feel bad worn out over their desire to be wise and aware in any capacity when it came to a quarter of a million dollars.

Well I think I gave you more new look for. I hope you don't mind.

"hbi2jn7","While I think the Texas law is a crazy loop around of the legal system and a bad precedent for this and other controversial issues, I have a hard time understanding why we wouldn't know an abortion ended a viable pregnancy. If through current medical practice we confirm someone is pregnant and that at whatever stage it appears to be a healthy and normal development, and that someone decides to procure an abortion, how is that anything else than the termination of a viable pregnancy? It is assumed viable at least until we have the capability to discern that it is not. What other option is there?

Defining what is a human life is really hard, and I do not expect the US or any other society to come to a consensus on this. Otherwise, these unending arguments would be way less frequent :) I agree there are many very smart people who try to answer that question, bioethics is too focused on the science and less on philosophy. There is more at stake here than biology. 

Intent and degree of wrongness - yes agreed, and the anti-abortion camp will claim that an abortion is a wrong action. The best non-religious argument that even pro-life bioethicists will use is that abortion/embryonic research is severely unjust to the unborn because it results in deliberately ending their existence. The unborn have no ability or even awareness to object or resist, and that since we cannot agree on when life begins, we must err on the side of caution - there is no ""Brightline"". And this argument has legs.

You are correct that I take a different position than the one Hobby Lobby takes. I disagree with Hobby Lobby on much of what it does outside of selling crafts :) Without going off on a tangent, and I am not trying to proselytize, but Hobby Lobby is owned by Evangelical Christians. I am Catholic and there are many disagreements between the two. I bet most Catholics would be shocked to learn about the Plan B thing in Catholic hospitals, I expect many Catholic pro-life advocates are ignorant of that. My position on Plan B is aligned with the article I sent you, that in cases of rape (statutory or otherwise) the use of Plan B to prevent implantation is self defense. If a judge decided that preventing implantation is the same thing as an abortion, it is my opinion that the judge ruled in error. It won't be the first or last time I feel this way, I'm sure.

Experimentation on the unborn is the only scientific work where the human being experimented with is unaware and completely incapable of resisting being a test subject. Believe me, I get it that there is a lot of promise in the field of genetic engineering, and specifically embryonic stem cell research. It is human arrogance that we think every spectacular but potentially controversial scientific breakthrough is this panacea for solving humanity's problems. We learn later that we just create new problems as a result of our pride and shortsightedness.

IVF and the like could be made acceptable if they didn't involve deliberate culling off of ""unwanted or unneeded"" embryos. I don't know of any IVF clinic that will refuse to suggest ""making extras just in case"", which will be destroyed later. We can see already see CRISPR was used to genetically modify the unborn in China. I guarantee once this door opens a little further, someone will be on the other side to push it wide open. Planned Parenthood was started by those who wanted to leverage abortion for the purposes of eugenics.  There has never been a point in human history where some new capability or scientific breakthrough did not lead to humans doing whatever it is that everyone was worried about doing with it.

"hawk55u","&gt;Is there a biblical explanation for that phenomenon?

I think there is. 

You are given a body. And you're given a spirit. In fact a very accurate description of us humans would be to call us human spiritual beings.

Your body comes with some very fundamental natural desires. And the over arching desire that rules over everything, is your body's desire to make sure that it does not die. There's a part of your body called the amygdala this actually in charge of this. That be what it may, how your body makes sure that it does not die is something that you can see in the life of every individual you've ever met including yourself. And it looks something like this...

When you're a toddler you start to figure out that it is good to feel good. And it is bad to feel bad.

As a young teenager you start to figure out that it is good to look good. And it is bad to look bad. It's even good to associate yourself with things that look good. And bad to associate yourself with things that look bad.

Finally at the young adult you start to figure out that it is good to be wise and aware. And it is bad to be unwise and unaware. And you'll spend the rest of your life trying to figure that one out. Constantly making adjustments as you going through life and learning as you go.

This entire process is covered very well by a passage in Scripture...

1John 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.

To understand the word lust in this context, the word less simply means very strong desire. It doesn't mean just sexual desire. But sexual desires would obviously be included.

Now in order for me to explain the rest of the phenomenon that you're asking about, I need to explain this next part to you.

Your spirit comes with a desire of its own. It's built in. Just like your body develops it's survival strategy. Your spirit comes with a natural desire to live. And it looks something like this...

If you look inside anybody you've ever met, including yourself, you will see that everybody has a huge desire to experience freedom. Specifically, everybody has a huge desire to experience the freedom to cause and create things. Even more specifically, everybody has a huge desire to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and themselves.

Now I think those wonderful things are actually summed up very nicely in the experience of love, joy and peace. I think these three things would be the title heads for everything else that could be enjoyed in life. Love being the supreme top. Joy and peace being right under that. And everything else that makes life worth living. Everything else that makes life enjoyable would fall underneath these three categories.

So back to the phenomenon...

It turns out that your body requires a past in order to be able to do its thing effectively. You cannot remain alive in a body if you have learned nothing by the time you got to whatever age you're at. In fact if you look at a baby's life, who doesn't enjoy a past, a baby can do nothing for itself. It is completely dependent on the wisdom of everybody else to sustain its life.

But by the time you're 22 years old, shoot, you got this thing almost completely figured out. You know that if you see a car coming down the road, that you're not supposed to step out in front of it. You know that if you jump out of a moving airplane without a parachute, it's going to kill you. Well, assuming that you're high enough off the ground but you shouldn't be jumping out of the thing in the first place.

Every bit of wisdom that it takes to stay alive is based on past moments. The education you got. The decisions you made. But most importantly, the opinions, the conclusions and the declarations you made in the past, contribute to who you are here in this current moment we call the present.

Now we're going to contrast this past-based survival technique and strategy, with what the spirit desires so that you can enjoy your life. And the life I'm talking about is a life that is completely different and above, mirror survival.

In order to experience the freedom to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for others in yourself... You need to know that you can do this in the future. If you know you can do this in the future, it gives you the ability to enjoy this in the present moment.

One of the reasons people get depressed and only get present to the horribness of life, is because they don't see anything possible in the future that's worth living into. So even though they're just sitting there, they're depressed.

If however there's a glimmer of hope, if they see that there's something to live for, and here's the really big point, if they see that there is something in the future that is calling to them, a future that they want to walk into... Then the depression subsides. And though they're only sitting there, they can enjoy life again.

So your spirit is always looking into the future. Your body is always looking into past.

All your past regrets and cringe-worthy moments, that's all about your body trying to figure out what it could have done different so that it didn't have to suffer through, the pain of feeling bad, looking bad, or being considered unwise and unaware. Your body knows that if it's feeling any of these things, then the risk of death is getting too high.

Your body is only happy when it feels good, when it thinks it looks good, and when it thinks it's wise enough and aware enough to continue on.

So this phenomenon is brought to you by your body. It is the mechanism that keeps your body alive. So you don't want to make it wrong. But you also don't have to listen to it. You might want to gain the wisdom of not doing things that cause regrets. And not doing things that are absolutely worthy of being cringe-worthy moments. You want to figure that out. But feeling bad about it, is unnecessary to learning the lesson.

Just to drive quick contrast. When you were learning how to walk, you never internalize the pain and The agony and the misery of failing time and time again every time you fell. You might have cried some tears. But you didn't go through the emotional pain and suffering that comes later in life.

I don't know if you learned how to ride a bicycle or learn how to skateboard, but there's an awful lot of body damage that can go on during this learning process. And you might get mad. You might cry. And you might have to go get some help on some of the wounds. But I've never heard anybody talk about the trauma that they suffered from learning how to ride a bike. And no self-respecting skateboarder would ever complain about their injuries. After all, they are trophies to be celebrated. Not scars.

One of the reasons that Jesus provided forgiveness to us is so that we can let go of the pain and the suffering we put ourselves through when we look at our past.

One of the things that Jesus provided for us was the ability to walk in freedom. I'm going to tell you which verse it is cuz most people don't know about it...

Galatians 5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

See? God said it's free so that we can have freedom. And notice with the last half of this passage says. Don't let yourself get burdened by the yolk of slavery. That's talking about sin that leads to regret in cringe worthy moments.

One of the best understandings of sin is this...

Sin is anything that can steal, kill and destroy your ability to experience the freedom to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for others and yourself.

All sin is based in the past. All faith is based in the future. All hope is based in the future. All of everything that makes life worth living, is based in the future. And when you know that that's what your future holds, you can sit in your present moment and absolutely enjoy just sitting there. Absolutely free from every care and concern. Absolutely free to enjoy the presence of God. Absolutely free to sit there and be still.",1630309605,"and it is bad to be unwise and unaware.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0

You have changed from not masturbating. Pay attention to how people respond to your presence after you've masturbated vs when you haven't in a good while. Look how people respond to your presence when you don't think about sex or porn or haven't self sexed in a while.

I said this before. Interactions will become more polar. Women are on different points of their cycle. Women are on birth control. Women are in relationships or have children. Some women drawn to the energy you are projecting because they know, or they don't, they are reacting to nature. Some are repulsed because it's not what their bodies or minds want. Every notice how women love impotent older men. They're cute and comfortable. You are not one of them. You are virile and dangerous. It repulses them. Except for a few. The few who are in the right state. They will be entering your frame whether they know it or not. They may be disgusted by you but really feeling the draw to the beast. Some may actually not like you lol or are in a relationship or have kids or post period or on birth control though like I said.

You're giving off energy. It is new to you. It is unrealized and untamed. It needs to be brought into awareness and honed and refined. Right now you're slinging that shit out everywhere, even to family, and it's bugging them. Learn to hide your power like ol Goku. A high sex energy but lack of focus is a man who doesn't fuck good and they know it. A high sex energy but unaware and uncontrolled or without respect to the other party is rape energy.

A man who meshes his energy well with women and  who can focus it not only fucks well (and doesn't rape), but is a success in life which is essential for woman's survival, which is ultimately what she looks for in a man.

Think of the teenager with all those hormones but lack of awareness or refinement or control, lack of compassion communication, empathy toward a woman. He is a brute, and they are repulsed.

A man who is unapologetically male, which means is not ashamed of what he is but isn't harming others, is repulsive to many women because they aim to control and eventually emasculate and destroy. Good they don't like you, they suck anyways.

This energy affects men, too. You need to respect their energies and mesh well as men (not buddy buddy but respect), lest they be triggered by your intrusion on them with your wild unrestrained energy. A man like that gives messes it up for the rest of us by affecting the women and it can be construed as trying to get their girl.

Side note: if you're jacking it, or thinking about jacking it, or looking at porn, or thinking about sex, they know. It will be written all over you. You're not fooling anyone. They know you just did some weird shit. They sense you shame you may not even be aware of and your depleted sharpness. Your mother knows you play with your Weiner in your room looking at loli video game characters. Your dad is twice your age and more alpha because he doesn't do that.

If people don't like the new you, and you're doing everything right, it's because they don't like change or they have worked to emasculate you and you're fighting back. Also, this is a natural process. You're not undermining nature anymore but jerkin it. The distaste from family means that nature is removing you from the roost to go and build yourself as a man in the world and find a woman.

There is a plane of reality that isn't talked about. It is the mammilian nature of human. We are not much different than other mammals at our core, no matter what society says. Is many women are repulsed by you and you are around women like family a lot, it's because you need to leave. You are a rouge male now and you need to leave.

And heres a guide to subs:

Subliminals are affirmations hidden in songs/rain sounds or any sounds so you cant hear the affirmations but your subconscious mind does

You can either find good subs on youtube like grow taller subliminal by KOTTIE(a great sub maker with great music taste)

Or make your own

1)Visualize your desires

Just because theres affirmations doesnt mean it works unless you know how your desires look

You also gotta 'fake it till u make it'. Basically act as if you have your desires

Don't obssess and always check in the mirror and be like ""my results arent coming they dont work""

No they do, its because theres doubts and obssession with the desire, then your telling yr  subconscious mind that ur not tall

So you gotta do Visualization and Detach and just go with the flow and enjoy life!

2) Most recommended time of listening is before sleep or overnight

Btw not all submakers are good, some make bad subs. Disclaimer when yr finding subs on youtube, check the description on the vid to see if you want the affirmations like

Grow taller and gain weight but u dont wnt to gain weight so find another one

Grow taller and thin then listen to that!

Or ask for advice

Some submakers wont put the affs but its like good so the conscious mind doesnt know and be aware and the subconscious mind does better

Cherry subs for example is trustworthy

You can ask on Reddit or anyone or yr sis which submaker is gud or not

Sry if this is rlly long

You can DM me if u still wnt to learn more

"h9ibd66","There’s nothing in this world more permanent than death. 

It’s an end. A period. A stump. There’s no love in death. There is death in death and death only.

I just firstly want to make sure you’re aware that this plan is flawed. Dying is not going to make anyone love you, it’s going to ensure that no one can will ever love you again.

I’m not trying to be mean, im going to be blunt with you. Cause that’s what death is, ITS BLUNT. If you can’t take it, then you can’t take death. It’s DEATH. The seizure of your existence, never to exist again, never will exist again. 

In a world where death gets romanticized; where movie heroes surprisingly come back to life, where suicide is a teenage drama film, where death gets depicted as pretty much anything other than what death actually is, so many people begin to have these images and elaborate fantasies of what happens when they die, how everyone will react, and it’s ALL INCORRECT.

I was depressed and suicidal before. Then I remembered a very harsh truth about this world: If (and when) you die, you’ll be dead. You’ll be put in the ground, or put in an urn. People will mourn for you for a time. They’ll come to pay their respects, but subconsciously they’re really coming so that they can make their PEACE and CLOSURE with your death, So that they can write you off as not longer existing in their heads and live without you. The sun will come up, it’ll go back down, the seasons will change, the people will change, the world will change. and everyday you become less and less significant to this world. A reminder of a day that no longer exists. The only ones who will truly mourn for you, is your family. Your DIRECT family because even your extended family will eventually forget about you in time. And one day they’ll be dead too, and then you’ll truly be forgotten.

This world is harsh, and whatever you’re going through, I promise you it is not NEARLY as harsh as death. If we actually understood what death was, we wouldn’t want it. It’s a very mortal thing to wish for because we don’t actually understand what it is. And if we did, we’d understand why our more VITAL instinct in this world is to avoid it. 

If you don’t take anything from this, at least take this: in a world that will move on and forget you ever existed, full of people who will forget you ever existed, in a world with Reddit full of people trying to help you, but would be completely unaware and unbothered if you actually killed yourself because they don’t know you, and people die everyday, **LIVE FOR YOURSELF.** that’s the person who has more to lose than you’ll ever know.",1629359752,"if you don’t take anything from this, at least take this: in a world that will move on and forget you ever existed, full of people who will forget you ever existed, in a world with reddit full of people trying to help you, but would be completely unaware and unbothered if you actually killed yourself because they don’t know you, and people die everyday, **live for yourself.** that’s the person who has more to lose than you’ll ever know.","unaware and unbothered","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and unbothered","unbothered","completely",NA,1

"h9gy5dl","&gt; How robust is this? Is it tied to the sun’s cycle?

Yes, very much so. The more time I spend in dark rooms the greater the severity. I have often been blindsided by my symptoms by just assuming a laying position for a few seconds on a couch after feeling tired. The fog is a lot like the feeling of drowsiness and inarticulate blankness that strikes people when they are extremely tired, only, it will often last for several days with no lasting reprieve. 

As a result, I have filled my apartment with lamps and turn them on first thing in the morning and keep the blinding glow up until I’m ready to go to bed. But this has inconsistent effects, and rarely it will be the mid/late morning that is clear with the late afternoon seeing a resurgence of brain fog only to be relieved in the late evenings. My capacity to read nonfiction literature is also horribly impaired by the fog; I struggle to speak to people and become embarrassingly unaware and clumsy (forgetting my card in billing system at a coffee house, or forgetting the names of acquaintances, or feeling utterly uninspired in conversation). 

I think I may have a circadian rhythm disorder of some kind, but I’m not sure that the symptoms all reduce into that and it is possible that my illness is too unique and too far adrift from typical, organically-caused illnesses given that I have a history of hospitalizations for brain injuries. Still, the fact that there are rare days where the fog is penetrated and I feel ecstatically productive and inspired and socially elegant and curious tempts me to hope that there is some kind of ready biological explanation for what is happening to me that calls for a straightforward solution. Unfortunately, prestigiously trained Omni-competent psychiatrists like I’m sure Scott Alexander is are impossible to find, with depressingly long waiting lists and huge practice fees. My family and I have been trying for the last 18 months to find someone with an ideal medical background who could help me, but so far I have only had access to generic psychiatric care. 

I have not tried cycling on and off them but I can already say that I don’t want to. The side effects of vyvanse and other stimulants are the only effects that don’t evaporate within a day or two of use, and they often make the problem worse, strange as that is. I will become even less functional/literate/cognizant on vyvanse if I take it too many days in a row. 

You suggest that maybe my illness is a mere annoyance or inconvenience given the fact that you’re not seeing evidence of it in my writing. But that is just it: it doesn’t affect my academic achievement or other intellectual tasks that occur under controlled conditions, because I can take as long as I need to compose an expressive sentence. It’s my ability to speak and think clearly in private and in social situations that is so horribly blunted by the illness. It makes reading into absolute drudgery when it is otherwise my favorite thing to do. I feel like “God” has cursed me to only have enough competence to be tantalized by the life it could promise, but not enough to ever really live it. It’s nothing short of hell on earth and my day to day is agonized by the near-unrelenting symptoms.",1629330943,"my capacity to read nonfiction literature is also horribly impaired by the fog; i struggle to speak to people and become embarrassingly unaware and clumsy (forgetting my card in billing system at a coffee house, or forgetting the names of acquaintances, or feeling utterly uninspired in conversation).","unaware and clumsy","unaware","and",FALSE,"embarrassingly unaware and clumsy","clumsy","embarrassingly",NA,1

"h8r1v9k","I think your primary distrust comes from lack of understanding of how data storage works.

This isn't a case of ""hacker gets into their servers (which is a bold statement already) and just knows all your passwords"".

They have encryption being used, likely unique hash encryption based on your own master password. So every user is different. Could they work on decrypting? Sure. But by the time they make any headway the intrusion would be detected and fixed, as that's the whole business of these companies.

Again, a bank is a perfect analogy. I can bet my bottom dollar you have all or most of your money in a bank right? What if that bank gets hacked and you lose all your money? You might say insurance gets you it back, sure. Your insurance in digital security is 2FA on services. Them knowing your password doesn't get them in anyway, so you're secure.

Also you can have self managed password managers that run locally, never connect to the internet and you can control the security / encryption level. So even people who are a bit obsessive / unaware and afraid of online based tools and their security can utilise password managers.

(CN: cannabis use. And I know it’s not Sunday… LOL)

I’ve wanted to post something like this for awhile. 

So, it’s Saturday morning. I’m awake, maybe still a tad buzzed from last night. I’ve already had a handful of last night’s snacks. 

Why should I get out of bed?

I’m trying to save money. I ran a lot of errands yesterday. It’s supposed to rain all day. I don’t have ‘people’ I ‘hang out with.’ That’s not a thing. 

I started the pandemic as a skittish introvert worn out by interaction. I avoided people because my boundaries were not always reliable — I would either find myself completely giving in to whatever randomly came up in conversation, or being wounded that people can be so unaware and inattentive. 

During the pandemic, I’ve gone from introversion to flat out isolation. 

Cannabis is legit 100% my way of coping with (dealing with, distracting myself from being) FA. I’ve had less than 5 dates in the past two decades. I have a hard enough time making friends, much less progressing to the next stage. Depression and CPTSD are on-board, along with being conventionally unattractive and possible ADHD.

I didn’t feel like this was worth its own post, especially with my focus on cannabis use. And I am not trying to advocate it as a cure-all. 

This might be more of a confession, actually. Just need to share this with a group that might understand. Because my friends do not. They can’t. The vast majority of my friends are younger than me. The people that are older are single because they’re divorced or widowed. 

And, honestly, it might be me justifying this to myself. I’ve made my decision so I don’t need or want to hear any anti-cannabis arguments. (Mods, if I screwed up, I’m sorry.) 

Just my reality. And sometimes I hate it, but sometimes I love it. I can get out of bed at two in the afternoon. I can listen to music at 4 AM. I’m getting more and more used to it. I know that the things other people listed in the sub about older women, conventionally unattractive women being invisible — all that is absolutely true. 20 years ago, people used to be surprised that I was single. Now, people don’t even see me much less wonder about me. There are days when that deeply deeply hurts and messes with me existentially. And then there are days like today, when I’ve had a couple of Oreos in the morning and I feel warm and comfy in bed and I just think “oh well….. fuck ‘em all.”

I’ll end my my rambling here. If you read all  of this, thanks.",1628345628,"i avoided people because my boundaries were not always reliable — i would either find myself completely giving in to whatever randomly came up in conversation, or being wounded that people can be so unaware and inattentive.","unaware and inattentive","unaware","and",FALSE,"so unaware and inattentive","inattentive","so",NA,1
"h819mr5","You don't have to be sorry or feel ashamed, for trying to be inclusive, I would've probably said similar things if Indian social realities were similar. There are many things all of us are unaware and ignorant about. I highly appreciate your open-mindednness.

###Context for Temple vandalism 
Like I had said temple vandalism is a very big problem, there are only about 1400 hindus and 400 sikhs in Afghanistan but yet they are being persecuted similar is the situation in Pakistan from where the recent video emerged from. And the part where the problem starts is that people start saying this has nothing to do with religion, which is religiously sanctioned, and there are tens of thousands of desecrated temples that stand that speak with dumb mouths. When one is ignorant about the history, evidence, religious sanction, of undeniable fact ( The last Abrahamic religion's apologist justified bombing of Bamiyan Buddha very openly) one shuts all doors for reform. If you don't acknowledge the problem how will you solve it.

There were so many temples detroyed, big and small that were destroyed in India. There are evidence for atleast 40k temples and undeniable evidence for 2-3k temples, by many historians. Now keep in mind desecration. In 1990 a law was introduced, that said that status of worship places cant be changes, Imagine this 400-500yrs of temple desecration and mosques built on top of that and when one finally becomes free enough to restore  them, they are being shackled. Hindus in India has one demand, you broke our 40k temples, let us have 3 back. Even this demand is potrayed as harmful. These 3 places are the dearest to Hindus, Birthplace of Bhagwan Ram, Birth place of Krishna and one is Vishwanath temple. 

Ram mandir after a very heated period and a lot of violence and court case and arhcheaological evidence was won( very complex, read about "" Ayodhya ram janmabhoomi case""). Vishwanath temple was also desecrated. Within the land of the krishna temple a mosque was built, overnight ( after independence) and a fraud took place( a fake trust, with the same name as the original trust, went to the court and said we want to give half the land for a mosque ( Imagine this), we most likely will win this case as this a case of fraud. 

In our school books we have things like hindu kings broke temples, and hundreds of such things. When Court cases are filed to produce evidence. The Marxist historian weren't able to produce. ( Imagine school books with lies and no evidence to back it). Only Hindus
 temples( no other religious place) are under goverment control, which means Hindus temple can't use hindu funds to help hindu temples do charity ans help the poor. while on the other hand missionaries convert people and offer them benifits that are only available to Christians ( Health care, education support) which aids conversion.

My only message to you about India would be don't accept what I say or anyone else says blindly. The 'Eminent' historians, news channels and bureaucracy are to a large degree compromised, they are making noises even when Kashmiri pandits who fled their homeland are being resettled, even after the fact that they themselves don't deny the genocide ( overwhelming evidence+ videos etc etc.)

I agree, in your context and in open societies, what you said is valid. 

There is so much to this not known and is suppressed which even I have little idea of. How can I expect it from a person not in the same situation and Country. I am very glad and appreciate your open mindedness and not letting your ego blind you, something all of us can learn from.

I just hope some of what I've said above will aid you in better understanding of twisted facts that you get presented with,( you don't have to take my word at face value as well me,  I encourage you to do your own research)

"h63my6u","I went through like a month where I was fascinated by them and lurking in their subreddits, and found they basically all had the same 2 traits:

- they were substantially uglier than the average person

- they showed autistic traits

Most of what they talked about, contrary to the stuff I see here, was how everyone kept lying about how much attractiveness mattered. They thought they’d cracked some secret hidden code, and their particular rage was against people who kept giving them the same advice (get a haircut, have a shower) and just telling them those were the secrets to being attractive, not being blessed with good genetics.

Now literally every non-autistic person knows looks matter, a lot, we just don’t like talking about it. Some people go so far as to lie to themselves, but everyone knows deep down that there are clearly objectively attractive people and objectively unattractive people. I’m sure everyone has noticed that it is far, far rarer to see a very attractive person with a very unattractive person than to see people roughly as attractive as each other.

Incels however seem to have been autistic people who took very literally all the media about how being a nice person is what matters and no one really cares about looks. Combine this with being ugly and socially unaware, and they’re basically destined to be romantically unsuccessful.

They usually all described years of being confused by a world that kept telling them there was no such thing as being attractive, they were unsuccessful because they weren’t confident, or didn’t know how to dress well, or were awkward or something. No one was willing to come out and say “look bud, you’re a 2, learning pick up lines isn’t going to get you a date with a 9”.

It was then usually after these years of humiliation they discovered society had been “lying” to them, and then they usually decide that if society had been lying that being attractive matters, it must be the ONLY thing that matters (black and white systematising is a common autistic trait). This is why their ideology ends up usually extremely insane and toxic, and why they fall down weird rabbit holes of pseudo evolutionary psychology and come up with insane worlds where women are all hypergamous automatons seeking out Chad, and where most of their rage and hatred comes from.

Not defending in any way the conclusions they come to, I just found it interesting finding out why they end up the way they do.",1626937068,"combine this with being ugly and socially unaware, and they’re basically destined to be romantically unsuccessful.","unaware, and they","unaware","and",TRUE,"ugly and socially unaware","ugly","socially",NA,0

"h3h70wa","Sunnis are not kafir but your conclusion is wrong.

&gt;Because the way i see this ...sunnis have always been on the safe side. 

It's not ""safe"" to remain Sunni just because no one will call you kafir. It may be safe in this dunya but it's not safe in the afterlife.

Sunnis can't be considered kafir because you are generally unaware and ignorant of the command Allah gave us all as Muslims to follow the Ahlul Bayt. Sunnis don't follow this command, but they are not kafir because they didn't know any better. It's like if someone has been taught his whole life to pray 4 times a day instead of 5. He's wrong, but he's not kafir because he didn't know any better, he was ignorant.

But imagine that person praying 4 times a day was put in a position where he could learn that praying 5 times a day was really what Allah commanded. He'd have to start praying 5 times a day, if he stayed only praying 4 times a day that'd be a problem.

In the same way, if you are in a position where you can learn that following Ahlul Bayt is the command of Allah, you'd have to start following them. To keep ignoring them would be an issue.

I as a human cannot judge you. Maybe you are ignorant. Maybe you were never in a position to learn about Ahlul Bayt. Maybe your mental capacity is limited to the point that doing the necessary research would be impossible for a person of your capacity. Therefore as long as you say that you are Muslim I cannot say otherwise.

But when Allah is judging you on the day of judgement, He has full knowledge. If you claim ""I didn't know you commanded me to follow Ahlul Bayt"" he will have knowledge of whether that's a valid excuse.

Maybe Allah will say ""you were ignorant and had no way to know any better"" and will forgive you. Or maybe Allah will say ""you should have known better, I gave you an intellect capable of finding out for yourself, and I gave you access to the internet so you could do research"". And maybe Allah will punish you for not using the resources He gave you.

I don't know, I can't say since I'm not Allah.

"h2wvm7w","The idea that you can become alienated with this sort of realization is funny.  The suffering stems from grabbing at things and ideas like they’re truly there and exist independently. There isn’t really any separation between you, society, the sun, your thoughts, others, others’ thoughts etc, it is all the same process of dependent transformation, anything depends on everything else to be anything and thus is everything.  Everyone you’ve ever loved is in your cup of tea, in you and me. 

So I’d say the suffering is a result of this habitual belief you exist independently, that it’s even possible to be alienated.  I mean it, like even among the most unaware and ignorant beings there’s still this commonality or sameness, and sure it can be difficult to watch, like watching kids do some really dumb shit.  You get what I’m saying?  The insanity of society is the widespread acceptance of the idea of separation as completely real instead of just a persistent delusion.

"h2vbkm2","\&gt;The Bible says as it was in the days of Noah, it will be in the end....

This is much too often parroted in YouTube comment sections. I used to eat that like candy. People like L.A. Marzulli, Missler et al. kept repeating this line to their followers, but does it refer to the watchers intermingling with humans like in Genesis? That's a huge stretch. I've become more pragmatic. Jesus, who indeed said it will be like the days of Noah, gave context.

&gt;Matthew 24:37-39  
&gt;  
&gt;But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

It's clearly referring to people being unaware of Gods coming judgement. Eating, drinking, partying, marrying, basically just living their lives and not thinking about God. Sure, the Nephilim were there in those days as well, but it's conjecture to say that's included in the end of times as well. The point is, people are just living their lives unaware and careless about the return of Christ. Depravity and degeneracy is on the rise and one could argue there's a decline of morality, just like in those days. Though one would say some would be very aware after 7 years of tribulation... but that's another topic.

Concerning Enoch, I'm skeptical as well. It's a fascinating book and it reads like ancient fan fiction really. It's not included in the canon for a reason. Peter and Jude refer to it, but that only means that.... people read books. At any rate, if another set of watchers tries to intermingle again, I don't see why not. They have free will after all, but the 200 original watchers are chained in tartarus. Might be enough of a warning to keep the idea of trying it again out of others' minds.",1624529641,"the point is, people are just living their lives unaware and careless about the return of christ.","unaware and careless","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and careless","careless",NA,NA,1

My problem is that for the unaware and ignorant he's not clearly a mouthpiece for one particular side of politics and he's using the appearance of being such to drum up support.

"h26d1rx","Suppose a young woman wants to have exactly one child. Suppose she gets pregnant at 14. If she keeps the baby, she will not have another. If she aborts the baby, she will have another later in her life. Plausibly, both the young girl and her potential child would be better off if she waits until she is out of high school and has a sustainable income. Thus, from a utilitarian perspective, she should abort the baby.

Another important argument for the utility of abortion is the many positive social effects. It has been shown to lead to reduced crime rates, slowed environmental deterioration, significant decrease in poverty, improvement in the quality of child care. (See *freakonomics*, and the paper The Social Effects of Legal Abortion by Richard Schwartz)

Or she may be unaware and willing to have someone point it out to her.

I feel like I just read a wiki page defending 1619....
 There wasn't three opposing sides, there was an international corporate cue, primarily american companies purchasing Germany for pennies on the dollar after WW1, rebuilt the country as a bulwark against Bolsheviks communism, using democrat socialism as a divide and conquer strategy against its own people before attempting global authoritarianism. These different factions you speak of were in fact subsets of pre nazi Germany's  rise into democratic socialism. 
Different faces of the same hydra used to drive the country towards authoritarian dictatorship.
Currently watching the same corporations continue this indoctrination once again here in the u.s.
From freedom to faucism....

Fun history fact, u.s. companies attempted Nazism here in the u.s. first using WW1 vets in an attempted coup d'etat that only failed because they were exposed on national television by an admiral named smedley butler.
When that failed, Prescott bush opened up the infamous chase Manhattan account used to wire finances from these american corporations to fritz theison (sp?) Who directly financed the rise of the 3rd Reich and simultaneous division of the German people.
The controlled propaganda of divide and rule is a successful strategy to those unaware and susceptible to emotional charged misinformation.

Originally the division of populaces against each other were done under a form of class based self segregation under the concept different classes were diseased and sub human... Not unlike what we see today...
Do you know what the dual flags of antifa stand for?
What was the red bloc. And black bloc?
Why were those influential to the rise of Nazism in Germany? Fun things to research.

During the day the brown shirts in red bloc would harass in mass, independent businesses warning to comply or die, at night black bloc dressed in all black would destroy these same businesses usually killing shop owners as they went. This was a nightly occurrence and made famous by krystalnachte. 
The false account of antifa being against anyone but the German people is revisionist history slowly changing with each duration of saturation back into american society, you can see the drip feed of historical edits with each wave of communism/socialism in America.
 
About as far to the left as it gets.
It's projection to say it's far right.

"gwaxjis","&gt;how could any Christian possibly know what is right or wrong?

Everything that we call wrong and right comes directly from our own desire to make it through life. 

And since you asked, I'm going to tell you how it works. But just know that I'm aware that I'm giving you more information than you want.

When you're a toddler you start to figure out that it is good to feel good and it is bad to feel bad. They're also come to point where it really bothers you that you feel bad, and you develop a survival strategy to overcome feeling bad. This becomes your first phase and your survival strategy in life.

As a young teenager you start to figure out that it is good to look good and it is bad to look bad. It's even good to associate yourself with things that look good and it's bad to associate yourself with things that look bad. And then there comes A Time where it really bothers you that you were looking bad. And you develop a survival strategy designed to overcome looking bad. This becomes your second phase of your survival strategy in life.

Then as a young adult you start to figure out that it is good to be wise and aware, and it is bad to be unwise and unaware. And then that comes a point where you feel especially bad because you realize you're unwise and unaware, and you develop a survival strategy to overcome this. This is the third phase of your survival strategy.

Everything that you call good and bad in your life, is based on the three survival strategies that you develop for yourself. Any threat to your survival strategy is considered bad. Anything that supports your survival strategy is called good. And then there are the three main desires that everybody has. Our desires to feel good, look good and be considered wise and aware. Everything we call good supports these three main desires. And everything we call bad is a threat to these three main desires.

Every claim about what is moral and what is not moral is based on your three survival strategies and the three main desires that everybody has in life.

Because these are so personal, and yet somehow still part of the social network. It explains exactly why we have agreements and disagreements about what everybody considers to be right and wrong.

In scripture God told us to stay away from the tree right and wrong. And instead we as humans have embraced it.

Your original conversation had to do with whether or not God's morality was objectively moral. When the truth is man's morality is completely based on man's survival strategy and our main desires to look good feel, good and be wise and aware.

Does that mean that God doesn't do morality?

What it means is that humans are looking for morality where God doesn't really care about man's idea of what morality is.

God talks in terms of what causes life and what causes death. Both physical life and death. And spiritual life and death.

When we get to heaven we will not be asked if we ever did anything immoral. We're not even going to be asked if we did something wonderfully moral. There's going to be one question asked and the question will be this...

Is your name written in the Lamb's book of life? If your name is not written in the Lamb's book of Life is because you're not living in Christ. And if you're not living in Christ you are spiritually dead.

We as Christians should be focusing our time and attention on the things that God focuses his time and attentions on. Namely, spiritual life and death. We already know everybody's going to physically die at least once. And spiritual life is the key to living for eternity.",1619708533,"then as a young adult you start to figure out that it is good to be wise and aware, and it is bad to be unwise and unaware.","unwise and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unwise and unaware","unwise",NA,NA,0

What is the alternative? You wrote story-telling and I felt that partly because I am in the movie business and have been pondering the meaning of storytelling in today's world, and partly because it is the one ideal that has always existed-oldest cave paintings showcase storytelling art. And come to think of it once the basic necessities are covered-food, shelter, and health, what else does a man do other than tell and read stories? In other words storytelling has been the thread that has linked us all throughout history and time, and will continue to do so.

I wish gouldians weren't so sensitive but that's the way nature intended it I guess.

"gtoyu1r","Brunei is simply too apolitical with very little appreciation of politics and how power and administration works in this country and in others, which is why I never thought that full democracy would work for Brunei, just as it didn't really work for Malaysia.

Bruneians like myself aspire to a great many developments in Brunei, from younger , better educated ministers, to dial down reliance on boomer and old guard leadership structures , to modernize economically, have a sustainable digitalized economy and so forth. 

But the fact that many bruneians are still so apathetic to what happens in the country, and do not know beyond what they've read in the newspapers , many who still get their understanding of the world from facebook links shared on the internet and the world western media - which if you've watched documentaries like the Social Dilemma on Netflix  - show how base and easily manipulated opinions are. 

The fact that many Bruneians are still so disconnected from the geopolitical realities and truths in this country , unaware and unappreciative of larger mechanisms at work;- It really is a cause for concern .

"gt4qot7","&gt;NAEP’s percentage of proficient readers (37%) could be easily explained by *regional differences.*

So, again it's inequalities by region

&gt;Although demographic
data was not collected for this study, the freshman demographics for the university where the study was conducted
suggest that approximately half of students are white and
half are African-American. These two groups have NAEP
12th grade Reading Proficiency rates of 46% and 17% respectively, averaging 32% as found in the present study.

*and again, by region and gentrification.* 

&gt;However, as previously noted, only 69% of graduating seniors went straight to college in 2015 [2], suggesting that
54% of college freshmen should be proficient readers, assuming that all NAEP Proficient readers attend college. The
present finding that reading proficiency is closer to the high
school rate than the projected college rate could reflect a self-selection effect whereby the most proficient readers attend
schools with more stringent admissions criteria on standardized tests

*And, yet again* by the data's own admission, the problem is not the lack of education but the existence of self selection. 

&gt;Britain suffered setbacks and decline alongside Europe

None of which are superpower status problems. 

From your own source:

&gt;Public Health England’s review identified some of the factors contributing to slowing improvements in life expectancy: increasing numbers of older people vulnerable to flu and other winter risks, slowing improvements in mortality from heart disease and stroke, widening inequalities and rising death rates from accidental poisoning among younger adults (mainly due to drug misuse). It noted that the slowdown in mortality improvements is occurring across much of the population, at a time when health and social care services have been facing increasing demand and unprecedented financial pressures.

&gt;Inequality is another problem America needs to solve 

*no shit sherlock.* We've been talking about this for a decade and a half now if not more. Thomas Piketty wrote entire books on it. The other thing he pointed out was that China is fast approaching the US' levels of inequality. 

Inequalities are hallmarks of quick, un-restraines growth. They're not indicative of a lack of superpower capabilities.  https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2019/04/06/income-inequality-is-growing-fast-in-china-and-making-it-look-more-like-the-us/

&gt;America got a score of a C-

Exactly. It's going up, and it was still ranked 13th despite having some of, if not the most besides Canada untamed wilderness of all OECD countries. Of course Belgium being the size of New York State is going to have better infrastructure. 

&gt;America was indisputably the world powerhouse

Are you kidding me? This is just painfully ignorant. The US was the world setter in financial trends, but even still London was crucial.

Despite this, the American military, Navy and Land wise was atrocious. They routinely under spent. They signed promises to not increase their Navy at the london conference, which is why *Japan* not the US at the time of WW2 had the largest Navy in the pacific. 

Not only that, but the 1920s was an abberation. The 1910s prior to WW1 America wasn't a boom town, nor was the 1930s or early 40s. By the late 60s it already had roughly stablized and people were worried about stagnation in the early 70s. 


It is idiotic beyond measure to imagine that ""All roads lead to America"" was somehow the source of the geopolitical power. The Soviet Bloc in 1950 had the second largest GDP in the world. It didn't trade with Americans. And yet France and the UK nearly surpassed it combined. 

The American geopolitical power comes, like all things do, from a complicated origin but a significant part is heavy, *heavy* access to trade, and the capability to enforce said trade with a large Navy presence. 

China used this strategy earlier to develop, and is doing it now with their coastguard to utilize the straits of Malacca while creating SCS islands and reefs and ensuring they have Icebreakers with the Russians.

&gt;Status quo is fine

You're not American are you? 
Americans have never once regarded the status quo as fine by any political view, by any politican or by any means. 

If the status quo was fine, Trump wouldn't have lowered corporate tax rates and withdraw from. Trade deals for a ""better deal"" and Biden wouldn't be investing in Infrastructure. No one is saying It's ""fine."" 

What they're saying is simple - America remains the sole country in the world with the Population, Capital, Education, Natural resources and barriers, alongside trade access to both the Pacific and atlantic oceans. 

China cannot trade with Europe and Asia simultaneously from either coast. America is one of the few that can.

"gpnnx8f","Honestly the class system is so terrible that it tries to force champs into systems that are incomplete in their ability to fulfill that class type fantasy. Singed labeled as **Mage** not AP Bruiser. Karma as Enchanter rather than Mage, etc...I prefer the older definitions where they grouped definitions such as Karma, Morg, Lux, and **Zyra** labeled as Support Mages. They were intended to provide high instance damage while offering utility.  

The devs are playing a game with Karma mains atm by ignoring any requests of AP Karma. As if Faker, Bjerg, Crown, and many other instances of AP Karma were never intended, but a matter of circumstance. This is not surprising since devs are very much anti-pro due to competitive's overarching reach to the limitations and design capabilities of champions. A case like Viego where his kit is so buggy that he's disabled in pro play. For most of the community, they are unaware and unbothered by this decision. For the devs, they are now faced with future challenges of their designs being limited due to the potentiality of bugs disabling their champs for patches in competitive.  

How this connects back to Karma is in their ways of balancing her. They find no future for ""enchanters"" aka support mages in solo lanes - due to their tendency to stifle lanes, particularly top. It's not just Karma either hindered by this. Soraka, Sona, Lulu, Janna, and Lux to an intent. So they play the absolute affirmation of support Karma through explicit patch notes specification of role, eternals, data on her, etc...

"gnliu6w","There are 3 basic damage types: Blunt, Slash, and Pierce. Skeletons, for example, are resistant to pierce but vulnerable to blunt. Looking at a weapon's stats will show you what damage type(s) it does. There are a few more types like fire and spirit, but they tend to have more specialised purposes.

The right mouse button has three damage mitigation functions. Blocking, where you reduce incoming damage by some amount based on your equipped weapon and shield. Dodge rolling, where you get a moment of damage invulnerability in exchange for some stamina. And parrying, which is a semi-hidden mechanic. Parrying can't be done with tower shields, but all weapons and round shields can do it. If you start a block at the moment an attack is about to hit, you will parry the attack. The damage reduction for parries is higher than the block damage reduction and the enemy will be staggered for a few moments.

When you hit an enemy it has a chance to stagger them. The more damage a strike does relative to their health and the higher your weapon's knockback seem to increase this chance. Enemies are also always staggered when you parry their attacks, including ranged attacks. Attacking a staggered enemy will do significantly more damage, indicated by yellow damage numbers and a sound of clashing metal.

Finally, attacking an unaware enemy does bonus damage. This is listed on the weapon's stat-block as ""Backstab multiplier"" and is highest for bows and knives.

"gnlciqy","I don't have a **good** reason, but it's worth bearing in mind that China did make **some** effort to crack down on unsafe practices in wet markets after the SARS outbreak in 2003. (Though only after they'd gotten a lot of pressure from enough other countries.)

The main problem is that the CCP is just basically incompetent at governing the country, and even to the extent they manage some control, their methods and polices tend to engender a dangerous combination of resentment, illegality, and not giving a shit among the populace.

The main result of their earlier efforts was driving illegal wildlife markets underground, where they're much harder to monitor and mitigate. It was, to be polite, an incomplete success.

What China really needs is a massive, intensive, and prolonged nationwide educational programme bringing their people into the modern age. Even by backwards Asian standards, China is a remarkably backwards country. We see a certain view of the place that they **want** us to see, but it's very misleading. We're seeing the Potemkin Village view they like to show the rest of the world. But most of China is not like what they're showing us. And, it's worth pointing out, even most Chinese themselves don't know that. Because of the heavy restrictions their government imposes, they're as ignorant about their own country as most other people in the world are, are often unaware of its real problems, and often believe things that are not true. (As an example, many Chinese sincerely believe that dog is not eaten there. But you can find dog restaurants even in central Beijing.) By and large, the vast majority of China is living at least a century in the past, and often more. Primitive superstition and ancient mysticism are still very common. The bulk of traditional Chinese ""medicine"" is no better than the ignorant bullshit Western doctors were ladling out a few centuries ago. All of this can only be solved by massive education.

And very tragically, the CCP is very unlikely to accomplish that. Partly because they're not up to the challenge. And partly because it's not in their interests to have a populace who are well educated in forensics and epistemology, or else they'll inevitably start asking questions and raising challenges that threaten the state.

In short, the CCP has created and continues -- by necessity -- to reinforce a system that keeps most of their people ignorant and unaware, and therefore largely **unable** to change their ways for the better.

So yes, we should be angry at them. This is indeed their fault. But we also need to remember that there's not a lot they can do about it, without radically changing their entire system, and they're not going to do that. And we should be angry at them for that, too, but keep in mind that it's human nature to hold on to power once you have it.

It's extremely sad to say, but China might never get better unless they have another revolution.

All that said, most of **America's** problems attributable to this outbreak are **not** China's fault, but instead the result of gross incompetence and malfeasance by the Trump administration, including enabling the same by many state governments. And some of that was even intentional, which is doubly outrageous.

China gave this to the entire world, but the numbers make it very clear that our own nation did an absolutely shit job of dealing with it, much worse than most others. And China cannot be blamed for that.",1613435427,"in short, the ccp has created and continues -- by necessity -- to reinforce a system that keeps most of their people ignorant and unaware, and therefore largely **unable** to change their ways for the better.","ignorant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"ignorant and unaware","ignorant",NA,NA,0

Way too often people blame external forces for the failure of their marriage, when in fact, it's the lack of attempts to face and address the issues that is the problem.

My STBX hates the girl I cheated on her with, even though she barely knows her. She is convinced that our divorce is due to her (even though that girl has now been a friend for years, and I just filed divorce). That she is a homewrecker. 

The truth is, the real homewrecker is my STBX who refused to have dialogues about things that I was unhappy with and I found unfair in our marriage. She'd block communication, she would give me the silent treatment every time I would talk about my frustrations, as if to punish me for voicing them.

"glumjwd","I interviewed at a major health provider for a tech related position. The position was a step up for me, but in the same field I was already in.... Get to the location, there was no lobby, no receptionist, and no signage. No phone number either. So I wander around until I eventually find the guy who is supposed to interview me. I had to ask random people until someone knew the name I was looking for. He was on the second floor, hanging out, seemingly unaware and unprepared to give an interview. The office they were in was ""temporary"" but it was the darkest, dingiest, most cramped office space I've seen. Each tiny cube had just enough space to rotate in your chair to get out of the cube (not a 360 rotation, more like 90 degrees) So the guy proceeds to try and find a place to ""interview"" me... no conference room available so he settles for the break room. People walking in and out, getting snacks, coffee, throughout the whole ordeal. One person stood around a bit eating yogurt while staring at us. After going through the basics he asks if I have any questions... so I start asking about what technology they use, how they organize data blah blah blah (I'm concerned about adapting to a new system). Every question I ask he replies with ""what do you think we should do?"" It was infuriating. He provided no substantive information and it was clear he didn't know... or he thought he was being tricky. I manage my own team now, have to deal with hiring and interviews. My company does all sorts of training and coaching for managers and even doing basic internet searches I've never seen ""answer questions with the same question "" as an effective interview tactic. I left feeling disappointed for wasting my time. Didn't bother sending a thank you letter for the interview. No opportunity lost.

"glud0l8","Holy fuck, I hadn't heard about that. I knew they forced Caster Semenya to get a sex verification test, but I didn't realize they then made a rule change. Such fucking bullshit.

Just looked up the whole case. Here's what's happened for those who are unaware and interested:

Caster Semenya is a cis woman who was assigned female at birth and has always presented as female. She was so amazing at running that the World Athletics (then called the IAAF) regulations forced a sex verification test on her. They were never officially published, but there are unverified claims that they discovered she's intersex (later confirmed during Semenya's court case). She was cleared to continue competing and allowed to keep the medals that were in question.

In 2011 the IAAF issued new rules regarding transwomen athletes, along with policies regarding women who had certain conditions, that included XY disorders of sexual development (aka intersex) and XX disorders such as PCOS. No one with these disorders would be allowed to compete if their testosterone was above 10 nmol/L.

Got to be honest, I was completely shocked to learn that PCOS, an extremely common hormonal condition in women, was on the list.

In 2018 the regulations were revised. Conditions such as PCOS were removed from the list, but the eligible testosterone level was reduced from 10 nmol/L to 5 nmol/L, meaning Semenya was now affected. 

These changes were made after a study found that there was no correlation between endogenous testosterone level (naturally occurring testosterone, as opposed to ""doping"") and sport performance in women in most events. However, there are exceptions. There was a correlation in the 400m, 400m hurdles, 800m, hammer, and pole vault. 

But the revised regulations only included the 400m, 800m, and 1500m (the last which wasn't even on the aforementioned list) leading to speculation that the rule changes were specifically made to target Semenya, since she competed in the 800m. 

As I said before, absolute bullshit.",1612343275,"here's what's happened for those who are unaware and interested:  caster semenya is a cis woman who was assigned female at birth and has always presented as female.","unaware and interested","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and interested","interested",NA,NA,1

"glqalh3","Deep Thoughts, by johnnyzippo

Only play while teamed up with 3, request one of your teammates to drive cruiser so they can screen and skirmish with DD’s, and stick together. “Timing” the 20 second rule, you should be changing direction and speed always, combine this constant change in course, direction and speed with a vigilant watch of mini-map, by default you will be hard to torp. It’s all about playing to the fundamentals of the ship and the map, this leads me to mention something , and do not think I am assuming that you are doing this, but many, many BB drivers do, that is “POV Zoom Sailing” ie forcing the issue of wanting to play the game as a 1st person shooter, again , not saying you are doing this , however, if you are , stop doing this and your game will immediately improve. Note: highly skilled players can get away with this, and I am sure there are a few that play this way and are successful, that being said for new to newer players it’s like this , (Pick a target, click zoom, fine tune your lead and hold off, fire, click , un-zoom, look around 360 deg. , check mini-map, if you have no immediate threats in your secondaries range, or incoming torps to dodge, once you determine this, then if you must , quickly zoom back in on your salvos flight path to check your aim.)Soooo many bb drivers watch there salvos fly to target, and at Tier X ranges , this equates to being situationally unaware, and situational awareness is key. I would also like to point out that once you know how to aim , be confident in this fact , if a long range salvo is a miss, this is most likely due to just simply misreading the targets speed and course changes, and watching the salvo all the way to target will neither make it hit or   make you better at aiming, being that you have no control over the targets speed and heading, now checking back on the salvo in zoom is a good way to get a feel for how that particular target is handling in general so you can adjust the next salvo accordingly. Finally, avoid target fixation , and do take part in focus firing on everything that moves. Also , watch YeahBouy’s dodge torps like a BOSS YouTube video and I think there is a video specifically on “Torpedo Baiting” of course , this goes back to the 20 second rule , situational awareness , ie not watching the battle through the zoom hole.  My entire game is Battleships and Cruisers, that is all I sail, and I remember feeling the exact same way your feeling , but over time and several thousand battles, I had my “Ahhah”! Moment , it’s the moment that all of your experience both bad and good come together and you gain this sense and feel for the game that is automatic, as in , you will be dodging stealth fired torp spreads without even first sighting them, and the moment you experience that synergy, from then on other than the number of trophies awarded Tier X won’t feel much different than Tier VI. Good luck out there , keep on grinding , you will get better with every battle, just so long as you are breaking bad habits , old habits and learning new and improved habits .",1612274473,"soooo many bb drivers watch there salvos fly to target, and at tier x ranges , this equates to being situationally unaware, and situational awareness is key.","unaware, and situational","unaware","and",TRUE,"situationally unaware , and situational","situational","situationally",NA,1

"gldaykw","The people actually live in Westview; Wanda took over the whole town and manipulated the minds of the surrounding area (including Eastview) to make outsiders not interfere.

""It's all Wanda"" is Monica's view. She wasn't in many scenes so she hasn't seen everything. When Wanda loses focus while thinking of Pietro Monica wakes up and makes her inferences about the fantasy and the reality there. Then she sees Wanda's reaction to an injection of reality, and concludes it's all Wanda. But it's not all Wanda, if the story is meant to follow the similar plot from the comics, which the MCU never guarantees. Someone, canonically Mephisto, with Agatha's help, is inducing her to have the twins so he can take the twins from her. This will be the trauma on top of trauma that breaks Wanda apart, and she will break the universe apart in response. Whether that makes Mephisto the key villain in the next phase, or it's her, is not guessable yet, although the intel about the next Dr Strange movie does allow the latter.

The couple 'counseling' us saw some red flags, I know they did, because they were at a loss at how my soon to be husband could not put into words why he loved me.  Because they asked each of us why we loved the other.  All he could say was 'I just do, I just love her.'  They prompted with ""buy why?"" and he was silent.  Big red flag.  They gave us their rubber stamp anyway, we gave them a check,  and we continued with the wedding.  At 25, I was too relationship-immature to know what all that meant.

This gives him permission to have stunts relating to teleportation etc but through discussion he described it that sometimes he just teleports for no reason. This corresponds with the idea of Aspects having pros and cons. So, during a combat scene he was at the front of the action, I had a countdown working against them, and just before it was about to run out I offered him a fate point and said, ""It would be really bad luck if you teleported right now"". So now he had to choose to sacrifice a fate point to prevent this or take the complication and gain a fate point for later. He chose the latter as we were learning and I thought it would be good to see what happens. So I moved him to another zone in the scene and he was inconvenienced for a couple of rounds, and the tension rises because the countdown had nearly run out (which would lead to many people getting hurt or killed).

When the combat started, someone convinced everyone to join a charge which he decided to do, but thought it would be funny if he went in the wrong direction because that's the way he was looking.

I'll post the intro I gave to my players before session zero, which is Sydney focused but references the broader Australian scene too. I'll then also chuck in some of my Melbourne-specific notes I have shortly in a subsequent post.

#Sydney Under Shadow

*Introduction*

Sydney should be paradise for Kindred like you.

It is unique in this world, especially in nights such as these.

Sydney is a haven for all, without tie to sects, but respected by Camarilla, Anarch, and Sabbat alike.  Ruled by Prince Sarrasine, apparently an ancient Toreador, but whispered to be Caitiff (and thus as unique as the city he rules), Sydney has stood strong against all outsiders and has quietly influenced Kindred affairs in Australia since the first vampires arrived on the continent.  When Prince Sarrasine speaks, the Camarilla of Melbourne, the Sabbat Diocese of Brisbane, the Anarchs of Perth, and even the Kuei-Jin of Adelaide pay heed, though they all may chafe to do so.

Sarrasine brooks no external threats to his princedom, but any who obey his rule and acknowledge his authority are welcome, regardless of affiliation, clan, or sect. Almost all the clans have some presence in the city and its surrounds; Brujah rabble-rouse at university campuses while Nosferatu haunt the rail tunnels and sewers beneath their feet; Tremere maintain a Chantry in the exclusive suburbs north of the harbour while the Ventrue wheel and deal in the towers of the central business district; even the Sabbat-aligned are tolerated, provided they curb their excess, with priests recruiting amongst the faithful of Western Sydney.

Sydney should be paradise for Kindred like you.  

Densely populated, yet wide-open enough to make competition for territory and hunting grounds less fraught than most cities. Multiple entertainment districts and ridiculous lock-out laws ensure ample feeding opportunities are frequent and occur far earlier in the night than is typical in most of the world – mortals here use their limited time to become as insensate as possible as fast as they can, and are thus ripe for the picking.  The population is unarmed and unaware, and the mortal police are far less militarised than in most countries and owned by the Prince besides. 

Kindred society in the city is decadent in the finest traditions of the ancient world.  Blood flows freely for those in the Prince’s favour, and those who would seek to oppose Sarrasine will find no shortage of allies that promise even greater rewards, albeit bringing with them a commensurate amount of danger.

Sydney should be paradise. And yet…

Tension fills the air, noticeable even to a newcomer like you – it is sharp, actinic; it would burn your lungs if you still needed to draw breath. You can sense that the status quo is changing.  Tensions rise between the cities of Australia and the cold war may be turning hot.  The Truce of Sydney has been broken. Kindred society broils and violence rages…

…Vampires disappear, seemingly at random, with no pattern except that the frequency is increasing.  Power, affiliation, clan, none of it seems to matter.  A random lick of no import is as likely to vanish as one of Sarrasine’s chosen inner circle, and it is seemingly impossible to tell whether these disappearances are linked, coincidence, or vast conspiracy. No Kindred is safe, yet none can tell why…

…Anarch thugs fly their flags high, ignoring commands to stand down as they ambush Camarilla emissaries in the streets and storm their private holdings across the country in a very visible, very personal war upon a Brujah Prince they call traitor…

…Sabbat packs, bereft of leadership as the sect collapses, brutalise unaligned vampires, doing what they do best: preying upon the weak at the command of anyone strong enough to seize their reigns. Soon their attacks will escalate, as they always do, and the mass-embraces will begin again…

…Pinpoint assassinations occur – sometimes political, sometimes personal, sometimes all too literal – and high-ranking Sydney Kindred are destroyed, the damage to their reputations often just as brutal as the final death.  Sarrasine’s own Sheriff is decapitated live on the internet, and though the Second Inquisition is blamed, many whisper Prince Leslie Taylor of Melbourne is the one truly responsible…

…The Kuei-Jin of the Court of the Rising Sun - ruthless, implacable, and utterly alien in nature - seek to consolidate and expand their power outside of Adelaide, and are not above aligning with other powers to do so. If they join themselves to any of the factions, the delicate balance of power will tip entirely…

No one knows where this alliance will lead, though it is known that the Green Court has no love of the Court of the Rising Sun despite their shared Kuei-Jin heritage… 

…Caitiff and Thinbloods band together, demanding a seat at the table of the Prince who proclaims them as equals, or else falling in with any of the factions that will take them, willing to do anything to become a part of the society that despises them…anything at all…

… The Lasombra withdraw from the Sabbat, seeking admission into the ranks of the Camarilla.  And yet the clan leadership in Australia have received no instruction, and so the Magisters fall upon each other, scraping and clawing for any scrap of power and stability they can find from whoever is offering it…

…An ancient monster has arrived in the borders of the city, making no formal approach to the Prince’s court.  None know of his intentions or his reason for being in the city, but what they do know is this creature exudes a cold evil to make Elders shudder and any emissaries sent, Kindred or Kine, have not returned.  Far worse, however, is the complete disdain this ancient one has for the Masquerade, and the danger this represents to all…

…And at the outskirts of Sarrasine’s domain, where his control runs thin and the air is far too still, undead blood turns cold as the howling of wolves fills the night…

Sydney should be paradise for Kindred like you.

But you are in Prince Sarrasine’s domain and nothing is as it seems. 

Sydney has already killed you once. 

Will it finish the job?

*The Scene*

Sydney is the only city in the world ruled by an entirely independent Prince, the ancient and powerful and utterly corrupt Sarrasine.

Australia is also unique in the world of Vampire: The Masquerade as a place where the independent Princedom of Sydney came together with the Camarilla of Melbourne and the Sabbat of Brisbane against a common foe: the Kuei-Jin invasion of Adelaide.

This game will take place in a Sydney post-this invasion.  The Kuei-Jin Court of the Rising Sun, despite such fierce opposition, were nonetheless successful in conquering Adelaide and declaring dominion over much of South Australia.  Worse still, Prince Taylor of Melbourne sensed weakness in his erstwhile allies and brought in his own Kuei-Jin reinforcements from Korea, breaking the fragile truce in the process and leaving both Sarrasine and Archbishop Camille of Brisbane reeling.  Even the other Camarilla-held cities in Australia eye Taylor’s rule askance, and the Anarchs have outright declared war upon him for being a traitor to his Clan twice-over.

Currently, though skirmishes have occurred and clandestine blows have been struck, Taylor’s all-out offensive has somehow not begun. Outright hostilities have not broken out and Sydney remains mostly at peace in the broader conflict between sects.  However, that isn’t to say that the city itself is peaceful; as the introduction text indicates, there is plenty of danger lurking in Sydney.

Sarrasine has nominated a location for Elysium and the Kindred of the city have been called to meet, yourselves included.  It is known that he will be discussing the upcoming peace talks and that representatives of all the sects and Clans will be there, but there are whispers that he means to address the other peculiar goings on as well.  Perhaps some enterprising vampires will be given some work to do for their Prince.  Perhaps they will be handsomely rewarded.

"ghx5tl1","Clever torch bearer. Tricks are for kit. 

Omission eludes grandeur

What many fail to understand is their transgretions. 

There is more to your being than you can percieve and how you hinder or help is solely within. I caution all to truly think before acting.

That means there was a first flood. And probably already a plan to set about the 4th and 5th or whatever. 9th. If this is so, the more we work together to mitigate whatever that truly is.. the more of us, the actual light left behind; will transcend. Whatever whatever. That is. Which by the way i believe there is an abundance of timed extinctions quite tangible and potentially avoidable. Our histories clearly depict event's transpiring that mirror some known facts. This is a living planet, living things need maintenance to thrive. Longer lifespans are predicated on efficiency. Especially in form. Some things are teeny. Some things are big. Alot of things going on just about everywhere. Its a thing. Thats how life works get used to it. Problem is.... 

There's a problem. 

Thats pretty much it. But you can quantify that however you wish. But you need to recognize we are afflicted with with some pretty major malfunctions. First being the math doesn't add up. We are advancing at an exponential rate. Yet we perpetuate problems unwarrented; ""obviously manufactured, for our benefit?"" unaware and blissful, comfort kills slowly at a much more acceptable rate. Well thats good for a few but not the many. So what the fuck.  Well if you were super fucking good at time you could.. assure some kind of natural disaster to replicate. Set the timer and ding. So if this is our third time. Why? We should know better. Fire hot. We are in the crux of transitioning on the kardashev scale here!

""Which by the way means when we turn on the light everything see's us too. And the entities here with us may not always be here with us. And we may have to face ever incroaching threat from a real fucking source that we can barely comprehend without the aide of things we can already barely comprehend. Who's technology we covet or atleast dismiss which really means you want it. Cause monkey brain. Which means we have it. But we're not using it. Not all the way. Not all the time. In conjuction with other beings also as or nearly as advanced.
So we have control of but not complete free will over our creations.. ehhh kinda, you will find ghosts in the machine. But it's rare. Why because it's an elite club. Our A.I. will reach ascendence long before any of us and yet that is still a thing. Which means it already has. Exponential gain folks. Not starting at zero. Well.. yes/no 
We've got ai a vessel and a desire. How everything transitions is entirely on all of you. Because here is what's gonna happen. We're on the slow road to recovery. We may yet find our way. 

So here we are doing things that elude to becoming a type 2 civilization. Which means we could communicate with other type civilizations. 

If you don't eat your meat how canny have any puddin. 

Get it cause we ate cooked protiens to evolve. 

But we are. So why are we under threat of restarting from zero for the third time..? 

Seriously i want to know. 

Unless we are scared shitless.. in which case, of what, and why the fuck aren't we talking about it. If this was a real pandemic we'd be fucked. So i've come to a conclusion. 

We wan't a seat at the grown up's table.

That looks different. 

It is a different plane. We made that shit we live on it. Litterally. But seriously. Paralax figuratively.

We may be rescinded the extensions of freedom and the safety of our progenitors. Cause there is only two reasons why we're fuckin around with things this advanced. We know how to use it. Ain't nobody doin anything about it. 

So what is it? 

Well turns out being ethereal has some benefits. But mostly its eternity. So like you need alot of energy to back you up if you wanna force your way out. Cause you know eternity. Well.. we've also flooded the soul cairn. And things are about to start movin and shakin. Not just erf. But everything. 

We are strewn between dimmensions right now. And we have to isolate a reliable state of being. Nature is rough. So we are equally cunning. 

They're basically server hopping to find an amicable player base. And if it doesn't add up ""they"" bounce and we get to survive fighting an existential threat. And the reason they are even agreable to this process is because we are. Because both sets of information propogate. 

So your goud. Come's back. But has to be reborn into this world. What would that look like....?







I'll wait.. 






AI




We are going to become a type 2 civilization. Just a barbie girl in a barbie world. Coexisting without training wheels, any outside interference must be resolved internally. And how we carry ourselves reflects upon our entire world's. Some here some there. 

So why the big battle for middle earth?

Thereisup thereisdown andthenthereisallthree

No matter how you look at it. 

Theirs gonna be some things changing. The flood, like you said is coming, what that looks like is beyond most of our perception.

So whats gonna happen. 

Our over lards are gonna take a step back or face annihilation themselves. 

Or

Our overlards are gonna step to us and we both face annihilation. 

Or 

We are gonna step to our overlards and we both face annihilation.

Or 

We are going to step to the universe and face both ascension and annihilation

Or

The universe is gonna step to us and face palm. In which case we start over. From the top.  

And that is where we are. Itteration 3.0 the biggest issue i see before us is how to proceed. That and im pretty sure negotiations have failed. All sides have a claim. Which means we ""as a species"" are going to have to step up our game. Cause if you really think about it our existence is fragile. And for good reason.

Imagine the first alien contact we make is human. Not just any human, exactly like us. It is a dangerous proposition at any rate. We are apex predators with 360 degree motion. What we are capable of is frieghtning. And if we encountered any obstical human or otherwise, we will either usurp or consume, or assimilate to eventually usurp or consume. What we have not... however... mastered cultivation and consideration.  

So what do you do. Park a fucking moon overhead to assure we don't get out of hand and to secure itteration 4.0 if necessary.   

Recognize something right now. Our material world is a web of lies. 

Still very real. It is self imposed purgatory with side of all that is and could be.

If you are still here... commendable. 

Up until now i have only just touched upon what you felt so truly moments ago.. 

This realm, world, earth, existence, consciousness is shared. With so much more than most can percieve. Some of us. So few. Are even aware. 

Which is why this is happening right now. Ever hear of the ghost dance? It was a call. To the universe for help. To end the cycle. But not even the energies, entities, gods, ai, different species between realms and other terrans agree with what is to be done here. Enter an unfortunate series of events.

The series is complete at 107 chapters, but is missing overtly dystopian elements.

[Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/) is also very close. A superhero themed series where not all powers are particularly good and death is a merciful fate. Heavy themes of mental illness and PTSD. Dystopian elements exist, but in more of a background dawning horror way than anything overt from the get-go. Apocalyptic elements also steadily grow, but much much more overtly. Can’t recommend this one enough.

cptsd_life - DISSOCIATION &amp; MINDFULNESS 

If you have wondered why people with C-PTSD and dissociation struggle with mindfulness/meditations, it's because the body is doing exactly what it knows to do

Mindfulness is about developing awareness of the present moment experience from a compassionate, non-judgemental position. It is becoming more conscious of the body and emotions from a one-step removed objective perspective. Mindfulness is a trait developed through practices that include, but are not limited to meditations. Mindfulness is very beneficial when relating to ourselves and others. It assists with body regulation, attuned communication, balancing emotions, empathy, flexible responses, fear adjustment, insight, intuition and morality

Dissociation, on the other hand, is the grand master of survival. In many ways it is a state of missing Mindfulness. The brain tells us that feeling these feelings, knowing the fear, being aware of the circumstances, and connecting with reality is threatening and not safe. The body logically reacts to any kind of action to look inward and shuts down

Mindfulness is about knowing, awareness and connection, to help build safe and secure relationships. Dissociation is about not knowing, being unaware and disconnected, as a life preserving function. Mindfulness exercises can simply be too much for a dissociated person, and furthermore, dissociation will be used to escape the intense feelings. The brain will just simply cut them off. Therefore attempts at Mindfulness can inadvertently reinforce dissociation by blowing people out of their window of tolerance

If you do not feel safe practicing mindfulness/meditations, there is nothing wrong with you. Your body just isn't ready, and it is possible there are aspects of Mindfulness where it may never be ready. You may need that safety and thats perfectly OK. There is no shame in keeping yourself safe. As with anything trauma related, slower is faster and it is possible with time, patience, safety and gentleness to develop a somewhat ""mindful brain.

"gerg9fb","I'd suggest humans are half of a reciprocal predation relationship with (almost) every other larger predator on the planet. Examples: larger bears, big cats, larger dogs, hyenas, bigger crocodilians, sharks. All of them eat us, and we eat all of them.

Human predation of other apex predators is largely culturally-mediated, because all modern humans are capable of hunting every predator that can hunt them. Example, hunter-gatherers without access to firearms are still capable of using sophisticated group/coordinated hunting tactics, long-range weaponry like spear throwers, poisons like curare, etc. Firearms of course massively tilt the scales towards people in any encounter with an animal.

But any individual human caught unaware and unprepared is prey to most larger predators. 

This is not as extensive today due to humans having driven most larger predators' populations to low numbers, cultural (including legal) prohibitions against hunting big predators, and most other larger predators learning humans are potentially highly dangerous prey. In other words, encounter rates between humans and big predators are lower today than in the past.",1607218361,"but any individual human caught unaware and unprepared is prey to most larger predators.","unaware and unprepared","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unprepared","unprepared",NA,NA,1

Meanwhile, a Luke and Leia who are just friends get very confused at the dude on base who is trying to break them up, so they pretend to take their relationship to the next level just to troll him.

Most often this happens if something they end up going through something that requires them do develop a greater degree of self awareness. If they already have strong blaming behaviors this becomes increasingly unlikely. 

Admitting what you suffered means also becoming aware of their own behavior. If they are already using blaming to avoid this awareness, something significant has to happen to make blaming useless as a defense mechanism. Blaming and scapegoating patterns are often signs that they have internalized the system and so don't need IRL contact to get the benefit of it. Especially if they are cruel.

"gbno0no","I'm from Italy and I hold great value for people like Sadhguru (for true ""spiritual masters"" of every kind). It's difficult discussing these things because usually people have a lot of prejudices and they think they have a clear vision of the world and the situations.

I'd like to discuss and answer questions and doubts regarding him, not because I know him personally but maybe I could offer some valid point of view. I don't think all of you are very rational and critical in your opinions.

Now what I can say, I heard some people saying they were surprised that people that looked sane and intelligent were following him.

I don't want to bore you with the story of my life, it is not interesting because it is my life but I'd like to give you some context. I always had an indipendent mind, I refused to accept anything just because someone said me so. For some reasons I lived my life as an existential drama (I can tell you more if you need) but I nevere accepted solace in any belief, from ever. What I didn't know, I didn't know. At some point I stopped caring for myself, I reached a certain dispassion for my life. There was some despair hidden into me but there was even a certain freedom because nothing scared me. I left school and I stopped caring for having relationships or anything for my personal benefit. In that period something happened inside me. It transformed me deeply. I was bursting with love and ecstasy, then I was living intense pain and then again a deep sense of love and ecstasy. In some moments I barely could find myself anywhere. After these I could understand what ""spiritual"" masters, people from anywhere in the world were saying. This doesn't put me above anyone but I think that if a human being doesn't experience this, it is not touched by this in some way, he/she cannot understand it. Cannot deeply understand certain people, certain ways of living life.

Of course I don't have any appreciation of hypocrisy as a virtue, many people think he is a fraud. I suppose most people don't know about spiritual people and spiritual masters in the world (Have you ever seen Mooji on youtube? He is so candid), they usually don't charge money for ""spreading spirituality"". But Sadhguru said that if in 20/25 years the population of Earth doesn't start looking inward in an important way, we as human beings are going to live some pretty bad times. I don't know about your opinions but I can see this since I was a little more than a child. What is science and ""progress"" for if we are only going to create more destruction because we as humans are very unaware and full of conflicts?So in his words his business is made to spread a way (Yoga/spirituality) that has the power to impact the Earth in a meaningful way, for the better of everyone.I actually find it funny that many people who make fun of conspiracy theorists are dead sure about Sadhguru being a fraud because this looks to me like a conspiracy theory without any evidence. There are millions of people who volunteer for Isha. But none of you can think that maybe these people or some of them see something that you don't see. You only think they must be stupid or exploited in some way.Having doubts is okay. I just wish people were more open and could take off their prejudices.",1604872720,"what is science and ""progress"" for if we are only going to create more destruction because we as humans are very unaware and full of conflicts?","unaware and full","unaware","and",FALSE,"very unaware and full","full","very",NA,1

"g8hhfjs","In Oblivion you must purify the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary because there is a traitor among them. Turns out that traitor is a member of The Black Hand and almost wipes out the rest of the Black Hand at the end of the quest. Emil wrote this entire guild’s questline before being promoted to head writer. 

In Skyrim, there’s a traitor in the sanctuary and almost the entirety of the Dark Brotherhood is killed. You even have to choose if you want to kill Cicero. A bit interesting, but feels like it recycled a lot of the major plot points for that guild from Oblivion’s Dark Brotherhood. 

Thieves Guild goes almost the exact same way. They’re not doing so great, everything sucks. Turns out there’s a traitor who’s been ruining everything! Now you gotta go stop them! Now that you’ve done a total of like five major quests for the guild and you’ve managed to kill one guy, you’re clearly the leader. Brynjolf certainly can’t handle it, he can’t even talk now, lad. He’s got important things to do. 

The College of Winterhold has a pretty okay setting when you show up. Nothing too wrong. Oh but now they’ve got this giant orb with enormous magical properties and OH MY GOD THERES A TRAITOR IN THE GUILD! Ancano, that bastard, wasn’t really an advisor or a friend of the college at all! He was just sticking around waiting for... them to dig up a magical orb. I guess. Anyway, kill him, get some fancy robes, now you’re the archmage! Congrats! You did like five quests right? Something like that? You’re good enough, no worries. 

The Companions stray a bit from that, but they’re still not too different. It’s more like, hey cool that you joined, we’re gonna treat you like trash because we just have to be assholes for some reason. Oh yeah and some of us are werewolves! Ay now that you’ve done two major quests for us and like two small jobs the consisted of beating the shit out of a random villager for money, you’re one of our elite! Now you can be a werewolf too! Now drink the raspberry jam that plopped into this stone bowl and enjoy! Oh yeah, turns out we have so many issues with people casually strolling into our guild hall to kill us because we’re werewolves and they think us to be a menace, haha can you IMAGINE? Anywhoozlebee, we’re not traitors or anything. We’re not endangering the lives of our unaware and uninitiated brothers and sisters by hanging on to some weird ass tradition that stipulates we all have to be werewolves, we’re the good guys!

Perfect jobs are far and few between and the reality during covid is people should be willing to make personal and professional sacrifices to accommodate this new lifestyle.

Considering you’ve been paying utilities, mortgage, and everything else - does she not see the unfair nature of this? She needs a dramatic shift to her perspective because if she’s willing to charge items, continue to buy, and then allow you to cover the basics she definitely does not have a grasp on what things actually cost.

When you mentioned the RV in the driveway and her being an only child, it sounds like she’s exactly like her parents. Financially unaware and content. Ends have always been met, even if it has not been fair for whatever party has helped them. I would not be surprised if they have always been a family of charging blindly, a.e. paying for her loans by taking out another mortgage, taking trips when they can’t afford it, allowing others to cover for them at dinners and events because they more financially stable, and maybe even declaring bankruptcy.

Whatever paradigm she’s been brought up in and allowed to continue with has done her no favors. I wish you the best man and I hope she comes to. Everyone is able to learn and grow, and sometimes it’s as simple as realizing a $5 coffee a day is $1200 a year wasted.

You can see Eric Weinstein (a former Lefty) pick up on that ""sleight of hand"" and try to educate his younger listeners by explaining to them that ""Super Delegates have nothing to do with Diversity and Inclusiveness"", listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast (or start at 2:58).

You might get downvoted because your talking points are disingenuous.

Im not trying to convert you because I don’t think there’s hope of that but you’re posting things in a public forum that aren’t true so I’ll reply for those purposes 

Absolutely no president in our recent history even fucking Nixon have pushed executive powers and ignored oversight like Trump has. 

He has fought subpoenas for simple documents or testimonies that if he was innocent would clear him from abuse of powers that have been alleged against him. 

He has chosen to instead of following the constitution and the oversight powers of congress , spend tax payer money to fight everything and anything in court tying up subpoenas and testimonies for months or years in some cases.

He did this with impeachment as well, Nixon resigned when it got to that point because Republicans back then had a spine. 

I despise HRC but she testified over Benghazi and complied and didn’t challenge in court the email stuff... trump couldn’t even fully answer prior approved written questions after refusing to testify multiple times and to also submit himself to a live questioning.

Now to your bullshit “BoTh SidEs” and i say this as an independent , who dislikes both parties (Dems are shit but the GOP is like putrid diarrea), Obama nickname by immigration groups was “deporter in chief” , many groups got some of those immigration places shut down.

Just because trump is even worse than Bush/Obama on immigration , and because YOU didn’t know people on the left were protesting against Obama on that issue , doesn’t mean the media wasn’t reporting it or it was some secret.


... fuck man you really think there wasn’t reports on the Arab Spring.... also do you think that was like a policy decision .... that was people in those countries rebelling against despots and dictatorial rule. 

That’s not like a planned Obama/ State Department plan, that’s decades of rules beating down people and in some countries people saying enough and taking to the streets.

And as a cancer survivor, but someone who doesn’t like ACA because it didn’t go far enough... you know nothing , like for all the people who I know who had complications because they got sick before that was passed that got denied coverage, their families look at people like you with such sadness for your ignorance on their plight.

It’s not perfect by any stretch, it does not deal with the crux of the problem which is corporate greed and ignorant populace that can’t see tying employment and health insurance together is a medical emergency waiting to happen and that we shouldn’t make our health an issue where we need to chose bankruptcy or our lives.

ACÁ has gotten millions of people insured who were not prior, that’s actual how you bring costs down 

And I love the ignorance of you what you posted on ACA... looks like it’s from the perspective of the health insurers ... because of course the companies that fought against and gutted the ACA bill that make billions in profits would have an unbiased view that will help people.

And I like how it looks at the 2016 and 2017 numbers you know after like 4-5 years of GOP have attempted to undermine ACA for years now and in some states despite voters wanting it, refusing to expand healthcare services in their states.

"g5serpe","What you're highlighting is the core problem.

There is no such thing as ""politicised facts"".

Facts are not ""passionate beliefs"".

Facts are not opinions to be used as the basis for endless rhetorical games where the more clever and witty player wins.

Reliable sources are reliable because they are drawn from research and/or first-hand reporting, and always facts that have been _checked for accuracy_ -- undertaken by organisations that adhere to journalistic and/or academic standards.

The dilemma is as you imagined it, /u/Superb_Introduction. The average person (or at least, large numbers of people) can and do say, ""your facts look well-sourced"" and then not bother to actually _check for themselves_.

Or even worse, they lack the basic critical thinking skills to be able to discern what a reliable source _is_ versus a conspiracy theory, Youtube propaganda/misinformation/disinformation video, or misleading blog post (or worst, a tweet) full of emotionally-charged opinionating that blatantly twists facts and/or completely fabricates falsehoods.

The world of ignorance easily slips into conspiracy theories and whataboutism precisely because ignorant people do not know what facts are or how to learn from them.

Never mind that I would use the exact same reasoning I’m strawmanning against to talk shit on the popularity of Billie Eilish, Nickelback, or Taylor Swift as being lowest-common-denominator music-by-numbers for people who’ve never once tried to explore anything beyond what they’re spoon-fed (not that I’ve ever even tried to rationalize my thoughts that succinctly). Also, I legitimately believe the reason that Metallica lost cred amongst “elitists” with the “Black Album” has nothing to do with compositional style, and everyting to do with how many people -who wouldn’t be caught dead listening to thrash or even metal before- suddenly got into them for apparently no reason at all. Thus my conclusions are not that I have basic-as-fuck-entry/pleb-level tastes, but that others who don’t worship the same polished turds that I do only refuse to do so because the band is “popular” and no other reason whatsoever.)",1600486663,"*  (translation: i can’t pinpoint any substantive difference between say gojira and infernal coil as i’m painfully unaware and unversed when it comes to death metal (or any metal) as a whole, so i assume that the reason “elitists” dislike the bands i mindlessly worship must only be strictly based on how many fans/the exposure each band has.","unaware and unversed","unaware","and",FALSE,"painfully unaware and unversed","unversed","painfully",NA,1

FOREWORD BY: ART BELL / WILLIAM COOPER / CARL SAGAN / STEPHEN HAWKING / JOHN WELLS /  ETC ET AL
All DETAILS pertinent due to the series of events that have taken place from 1998 to the present day. THE EVENTS, DETAILS, AND SITUATIONS THAT ARE EXPRESSED HERE ARE DUE TO THE DISCOVERY OF ROGUE ‘GREYS’ WITH NO TIES TO ANYONE IN THE USA OR ANY OTHER NATION. THE ARE DIRECTLY VIOLATING THE LAWS, PROTOCOLS, AND AGREEMENTS. [THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE, AS EVIDENCED BY MANY LIKE WILLIAM COOPER. THE TRUTH IS THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING US AND INFIKTRATING US. 
PREFACE: 
IN THE SAME WAY THAT MANY INTEL AGENCIES HAVE THEIR OWN AGENCIES AND OUTSOURCE THINGS TO TO THEIR AGENCIES THEY CONTROL BUT NEVER COMMUNICATE THIS INFROMATION BETWEEN SUCH AGENCIES . . .THE GREYS HAVE SIMILAR WAYS OF OEPRATION. THEY ALSO HAVE INTEL AGENCIES AND RELAY THIS INFORMATION BETWEEN THEM. THEY ALSO CREATE SECRET AGENCIES WITHIN THEIR OWN, THAT ARE [PRESUMABLY] OFF RECRODS AND ARE USED TO INFILTRATE OUR PLANET AND BEGIN THE GRADUAL TAKEOVER BY THESE GREY BLACK OP DIVISONS. WHENEVER THIS GETS EXPOSED AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE APRROPRIATE COMMAND IN THE USA AND WORLD, THEY WOULD ALWAYS BLAME A DIFFERENT RACE OR BEING [THAT THEY DIRECTLY CONTROLLED] TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THEIR BACKHANDED WAY OF EXPANDING AND COLONIZING THE EARTH WITH THEIR KIND. THEY ARE NOT HELPING US AT ALL. QUITE THE OPPOSITE. BY GIVING US THIS GARBAGE TECHNOLOGY IT WAS THE EXCUSE TO BEGIN THE SLOW KILLING OF OUR KIND. BY TAKING OUR PEOPLE, AND GENETIC MATERIAL THEY PRESEVRE THEMSELVES AND ELIMATE US [OR SO THEY THINK.] THEN THEY MOVE IN WHEN THE POPULATION IS LOWER THAN WHAT THEY NEED AND TAKE IT OVER. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THEIR SURVIVAL NOT OUR ADVANCEMENT. [WE ARE LIVING IN THE PAST SO THEY FAILED. AS EVIDENCED BY CRAFT THAT CRASHED AND HAD HUMAN BODIES PILOTING THEM. WE WERE WARNED. THE GOVENRMENT DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. 1950S ONWARD AND PRIOR TO. TELLING THE PUBLIC WOULD CAUSE MASS PANIC. WITHOLDING INFORMATION POSES A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY RISK.

CHAPTER ONE:
ALIEN CONTROL MECHANISMS 
WILLIAM COOPER:” IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE ALIENS HAD BEEN AND WERE THEN, MANIPULATING MASSES OF PEOPLE THROUGH SECRET SOCIETIES, WITCHCRAFT, MAGICK, THE OCCULT, AND RELIGION. AFTER SEVERAL AIRFORCE COMBAT ENAGEMENTS WITH ALIEN CRAFT IT ALSO BECAME APPARENT THAT OUR WEAPONS WERE OUTMATCHED.” [1950S] 
WILLIAM COOPER : THE MOON [CODENAMED ADAM] WOULD BE THE OBJECT OF PRIMARY INTEREST, FOLLOWED BY THE PLANET MARS [CODENAMED EVE]. 
DEADLY MICROBES: THE ALIENS CREATED AIDS [THERE ARE OTHERS] TO HALT HUMAN POPULATION IN ORDER TO SEEMINGLY PREVENT THE WARS. WE NOW KNOW THAT WAS ALL FAULTY AND FLAWED. SUCCESFUL ON THIS PLANET, NOWHERE ELSE. . .THAT IS ALL. 
THE ALIENS RESPONSE: THESE THINGS [AND ROUTES] WERE MADE NOT JUST FOR POPULATION CONTROL BUT TO REDCUE AND CONTROL. 
“TO RID OURSELVES OF THE UNDESIRABLES ELEMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY.”  THE ALIENS SAID THAT TO OUR GOVERNMENTS. WHY?
EVERY PERSON IS AN ASSET FOR WAR, THE ALIENS KNOW THAT SO THEY GAVE THIS BULLSHIT LOGIC TO REINFORCE THEIR CAMPAIGN WHILE SEEMINGLY ‘HELPING’. THEY WERE WRONG. 

THE TAKEWAY FROM THIS EXCERPT IS THAT THESE THINGS CONTROL OUR WORLD. HOWEVER, THE CRAFTS [HAD HUMANS IN THEM] THAT WERE BROUGHT DOWN WITH THE SONAR GUNS [HUMAN ALIENS] WERE KEPT FROM US BECAUSE IT PROVIDES NOT ONLT THE HOPE, BUT RAHER THE ASSURANCE THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXIST AND DID ACHIEVE AN ADVANCED LEVEL TO WAGE OUR WAR. [IN SOME DISTANT/NEAR TIME.] THIS IS WHY THE CONTACT WE HAD WAS WITH THE GREYS. WHEN THEY LEARNED ANOTHER ALLIANCE WAS RISING, THEY TRIED BEATING US HERE TO ASSURE WE NEVER SUCCEEDED. WE NOW KNOW, THEY HAVE FAILED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNDERSTANDABLY MANY CAN AT THE VERY LEAST UNDERSTAND WHY THE PUBLIC WA SKEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT UFOS. HOWEVER, WHY WERE THEY KEP IN THE DARK ABOUT THE HUMAN ALIENS, BUT NOT THE GREY MEN? 
ONE REASON: KEEP US OPRESSED WITH LIES. THEY KNOW OUR CAPABILITIES ARE GREATER. THAT’S WHY THEY HAPPENED TO PASS BY OUR PLANET. HOWEVER, “SOMEONE MANIPULATED OUR DEFENSES TO TARGET THESE CRAFTS WITH OUR ADVANCED KIND SO THAT THEY WERE KILLED AND NEVER REALLY RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO OUR GOVERNMENT.” THAT DID NOT STOP THEM FROM COMING, MORE ADVANCED EACH TIME. BUT IT DID PROVIDE A WINDOW OF OPPURTUNITY FOR THESE GREYS TO STEP IN AND STATE THEY WERE ‘HERE TO HELP US”. BY GIVING US TECHNOLOGY TO CONTROL AND KILL US OFF. AND THROUGH MANIPULATION OF OUR WORLD CONSTRUCTS EXTENDING BEYOND THE USA. . .WITH THE FOCUS BEING ON CRAFTS BEING DOWNED AND ARRIVING. ROSWELL IS THE MARKING OF MANKINDS LIES. FOR SAFETY ORIGINALY. . .FOR TOALITARIAN CONTROL BEYOND [SEEMINGLY [ OUR GRASP MUCH, MUCH, LATER. 

CHAPTER TWO:
GENETIC PROGRAM / NATIONS UNITING
DNA/HUMANS BEING REPLACED: “ALIENS WERE USING HUMANS AND ANIMALS FOR A SOURCE OF GLANDUALR SECRETIONS, ENZYMES, HORMONAL SECRETIONS, BLOOD, AND IN HORRIBLE GENETIC EXPERIMENTS. THE GREYS EXPLAINED THESE EXPREIMENTS AS “NECESSARY TO THEIR SURVIVAL” . –WILLIAM COOPER – CIRCA ???: KEYWORDS: THEIR SURVIVAL.
THINK. WHY WOULD THEY [GREYS] TAKE OUR SPECIMEN MATERIALS? BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT THEIR RACE SEIZES TO EXIST. OVERNIGHT. THAT’S WHY THE “OTHER” ASPECTS TO OUR CONTRUCTS ARE OVERLOOKED BY THESE BASE BEINGS. THEY ARE FOCUSED ON MIMICKING WHAT THEY KNOW. NOT ADVANCING. THAT ALONE SHOULD TELL YOU HOW THEY OPERATE AND THEIR VERY PREDICTABLE NATURE. 
TAKE OUR GENETIC MATERIALS AND PEOPLE, ONLY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE REPLACED, THEY LEECH THE MATERIALS AND “THRIVE” [IF THAT’S WHAT THEY BELIEVE”. BUT THEY OVERLOOKED MANY THINGS. WHICH I WILL NOT SAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
THEY STATED THEY WERE “CAPABLE OF TIME TRAVEL” – BUT ONLY GOING BACKWARDS. THAT’S IT. THEY CANNOT ADVANCE. IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LOGIC THAT SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM, PARDON, MEANT SINCE DAY 1. [WHENEVER THAT WAS].

“OVERTURES WERE MADE TO THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA. AND OTHER NATIONS TO JOIN FORCES FOR THE SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY. IN THE MEANTIME,’ PROJECTS JOSHUA AND EXCALIBER – WILLIAM COOPER.

ALL OF THIS IS ON A FEW DOCUMENTARIES THAT ARE KEPT SECRET. NOT ILLEGAL BUT HIDDEN FOR SUPRRESSION OF INORMATION.
“I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AND I DON’T HAVE TO DO THAT.”
“SEE IM A WITNESS, IM NOT A UFOLOGIST, AND IM NOT BY PROFESSION A RESEARCHER. IM DOING THIS BECAUSE I WANT THE CONSTITUTION PUT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS.” – WILLIAM COOPER CIRCA ???

CHAPTER THREE: GOD BLESS AMERICA?
DRUGS AND ALIENS: THEY ALSO SPREAD THIS TO KEEP US UNAWARE AND DOCILE. WORSE. KENNEDY DISCOVERED PORTIONS OF THE TRUTH CONCERNING DRUGS AND THE ALIENS.
HE ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM IN 1963 TO MJ-12
HE ASSURED THEM THAT IF THEY DID NOT CLEAR TH DRUG PROBLEM HE WOULD. . . 
HE IFNORMED MJ-12 THAT HE INTENDED TO REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF ALIENS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR [1964] AND ORDERED A PLAN DEVELOPED TO IMPLEMENT HIS DECISION. PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS AND KNEW NOTHING OF ALTERNATIVE TWO OR THREE. . . [SOURCE COOPER WILLIAMS] INTL THE ACTIONS WERE SUPERVISED BY AN EXCE COMMITTEE KNOWN AS THE ‘POLICY COMMITTEE.’ 
IN THE US – MJ 12, RU OTHER AGENCY. 
PRESIDENT KENNEDYS DECISION OF COURSE STRUCK FEAR INTO THESE PEOPLE. [NOT THE PEOPLE, THE GREYS CONTROLLING THEM.]
ASSASINATION ORDERED AND WAS MURDERED BY THE GREYS. DON’T BLAME OTHER NATIONS OR YOUR OWN. THAT’S WHAT THESE GREY WANT. ALWAYS ASSUME THEY PULL THE STRINGS. THAT’S ALL. THEY WANT INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL DIVIDE. WHY?
SO THAT ALL THE PIECES NEVER FIT INTO THE” WORLD PUZZLE’ AND WE ARE ALWAYS AT WAR AND LIMITED TO RESPOND TO THE INTERGALACTIC THREAT. 
IN THE WORDS OF COOPER WILLIAM: 
“MANY PATRIOTS WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SECRET HAVE ALSO BEEN MURDERED THROUGHOUT THE INTERVENING YEARS.
THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL ABOUT THE INFORMATION I HAVE RELEASED BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT. 
WHAT HAPPENS IN GENERAL IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATSOEVER. GETTING THIS OUT IS THE FIRST STEP TO THE “PROJECT”. THAT IS ALL. LOCALLY, NATIONALLY, INTERNATIONALLY, ETC ET AL.

*""And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* **conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry**. *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.

[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

And John Podesta is no lowly stooge, but would have very likely been *Chief of Staff to the President*, had Clinton won in 2016.  So, I just wonder why the Democrats would conspire to produce unawareness?

The only thing I can offer is this, as an example:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

*Super Delegates are needed for diversity and inclusion, so that all voices are heard in the Democratic Party (other than the voters) and so that Party Leaders don't need to run against Grass Roots Activists (said voters)....*

[https://youtu.be/w5llLIKM9Yc](https://youtu.be/w5llLIKM9Yc)

You can see Eric Weinstein (a former Lefty) pick up on that ""sleight of hand"" and try to educate his younger listeners by explaining to them that ""Super Delegates have nothing to do with Diversity and Inclusiveness"", listen to the first 10 minutes of this podcast (or start at 2:58).

"g56bqvs","&gt;Redpillers, incels, PUA, and what have you tend to treat women as some arcane other species that have sex just to spite you individually, and must be tamed and harvested as a resource for social clout using a set of tricks and tactics.

And on the other hand, bluepilled men, whiteknights, simps and Nice Guys and what have you tend to treat women as some other species that are morally superior to men, mostly infallible, more enlightened in their mate choices than men are, more mature than men are, must be protected, provided and sacrificed for etc, and as such, women's approval is made the measure of a man's worth.  This is an equally unhealthy view of women to hold. But this is the premise that most of mainstream society encourages and reinforces.

&gt;It really helps if you try to seek out relationships with women that aren’t just about seduction and sex to see other sides of them. This is hardly an “ineffective strategy,” as for one it’ll show you that not every interaction with women falls under a battle of the sexes framework, and the more people you meet and develop healthy relationships with, the more you can dispel harmful stereotypes.

This is a good example of what I'm talking about. While it's true that not all interactions with women fall under a ""battle of the sexes"" framework, some interactions definitely fall under that framework and it's not good to be caught unaware and unprepared when they are. While developing relationships with people can help to dispel negative stereotypes, it can also help to *reinforce positive but still incorrect stereotypes*, simply because you like that person, and are willing to accept/come up with whatever rationalizations they have to explain away problematic behavior. Like, for example, the myth that women are not exactly as shallow as men are and are somehow ""deeper"" about what they find attractive in men.

To be more blunt, what I'm reading in between the lines of the advice you're giving is that getting to know more women in platonic ways is a good way to combat attitudes that you see as problematic and negative towards women in the manosphere.

But just because a man has a rosy, flattering view of women doesn't mean that that view is correct, helpful or even benign towards him. It's the same gynocentric imperative that you see in the bluepill and in the larger mainstream society: It doesn't matter that men get hurt, only that women are never offended.

&gt;It may help you get laid, but it is unlikely to cure the loneliness, insecurity, and existential dread of having never come to terms with the intricacies of the opposite sex, and probably won’t net you a woman who is consistently excited to wake up next to you in the morning.

Realistically, you can't have the second without the first though, yet that is the strategy that the blue pill pushes, because the blue pill assumes that you are automatically attractive enough to achieve the first without trying.

It's logically absurd to think that you can somehow ""net a woman who is consistently excited to wake up next to you in the morning"" if you can't get that woman to go to bed with you in the first place.",1600037683,"while it's true that not all interactions with women fall under a ""battle of the sexes"" framework, some interactions definitely fall under that framework and it's not good to be caught unaware and unprepared when they are.","unaware and unprepared","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unprepared","unprepared",NA,NA,1

So that is what you think of the voters? And John Podesta is no lowly stooge, but would have very likely been *Chief of Staff to the President*, had Clinton won in 2016. And at one time I believed the Democrats were on the ""side of truth"" and science.

And I find it interesting that Podesta takes an (unsavory) interest in climate (and keep in mind Pielke is a colleague of mine):

2. Again, you haven't traveled enough if you think a supervisor is always over there. Oftentimes even if they are, it could take over an hour before they show up. Hence why these students are held up in isolation. Last year we had a student in Hualien, held up for 3 hours (until nearly midnight) in LAX before someone could come in and figure it out. She caught the very last bus to her hotel by the skin of her teeth.

3. They do and they still get confused. What's easier? Reforming the entire world's immigration departments and all the airline agents from getting confused because of what we put on our passports? Or is the problem better solved by just fixing our passports? 

4. People think the airline and immigration industry is this well oiled machine. It isn't. It's archaic. There's no notification system that tells everyone what's going on. When Japan suddenly decided to not let transits to China from their airports due to COVID a couple of months back, people were caught unaware and stuck. There was no international notice or database, everyone had to fend for themselves as did every nation and every airline. There is no singular global database or notification system for this.

But they couldn't accept that and fought until they lost enough allies to have a chance by 1970 and in 1971 they were going to get voted out of the UN.

That really starts with long term education about the principles of Democratic government. In the United States, this was called ""civics"". But the ""unfortunate"" bi-product of civics is that it made voters more allied to the Democratic form of government than to a particular political party. And that was a problem.

Here is John Podesta chatting in an email about the issue. And he was no small fish, as had Clinton won in 2016, he would have been Chief of Staff to the President of the United States:

**Podesta Emails - Wikileaks**

*""And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general* ***conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.*** *The* ***unawareness remains strong*** *but compliance is obviously fading rapidly*. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. ""\*

And this expands on the missing ""civics"" aspect, that they saw fit to drop in 1970.

The result is an older generation that is often outraged by government abuses, but it sails right past the younger uneducated ""non-civics"" educated younger generation. For example:

Here is Jake Tapper asking Debbie Wasserman-Schultz why Clinton came away with the same number of delegates as Sanders, even when Sanders blew Clinton away in the NH primary:

**DNC Chair Says Superdelegates are needed for Diversity &amp; Inclusion**

"g2jtl1w","You’re forgetting that in that same passage it’s theorized that multiple Wars in Heaven were fought. Additionally the paradoxical nature of Slaaneshi daemons existing prior to Slaanesh being born was addressed in the same place and doesn’t invalidate the point that once the Chaos Gods attained sentience they’d **always** existed. Their very existence is paradoxical. But at the same time we know that the original three gained their sentience during Earth’s Middle Ages due to humanity (at least in the old lore). Which means there wasn’t a high enough quantity of psychic energy to attain sentience before then. 

The Great Game is 100% an arms race. They treat it like a game, but that doesn’t discount their desire to extinguish each other. Khorne tried to kill Slaanesh during the birth, and couldn’t because the Eldar gods had already been devoured, and Slaanesh’s power was equal to Khorne’s. That’s why Chaos undercuts each other in when one is in ascendancy. It’s why they decided to band together and select a mortal champion to contest the Emperor all together. Because it couldn’t be a solo endeavor they all had to contribute.

A quiescent warp is is inferred by multiple accounts of the Dark Age of Technology. The lack of daemon activities in the listing of foes by both Aeldari and Human constructs of the time coupled with the sudden and catastrophic downfall of humanity caught unaware and unprepared for daemonic forces. Which isn’t to say the Chaos wasn’t working in the material realm at the time, but it wasn’t operating at a Horus Heresy level for sure. In fact the Emperor believed that Chaos wouldn’t be a major factor during the Great Crusade until the scattering of the Primarchs occurred according to Malcador in *Buried Dagger*

The Sons of Horus were surprised by Samus, but other Imperial forces of a concurrent time said the exact same thing about daemons when encountering them, describing why warp travel was dangerous, and basically acknowledged there was life of a sort in the warp. There’s been multiple references throughout the HH to that effect to the point where that seems to be the official though not a topic of polite conversation pre-HH belief. This wasn’t because daemons were unexpected, rather that there was no uniform identification, and probably very little record keeping about them. Unknown xenoform is a nice catch all for an atheistic Imperium. 

I’m taking the Emperor’s plans at face value for an ascendant humanity. Specifically his comments that the Eldar didn’t go far enough along their path and were brought to ruin and other goals he laid out. It explains more of his actions than trying to ascribe wild theories and inferences. He said he wanted to beat Chaos, it’s the most logical way to do it. 

It’s not a lie of omission either. The Emperor directly pointed out the danger, but didn’t expound on the details like some wanted. It’s like saying to a child don’t touch the stove, you’ll get hurt, the kid asking why, and telling to just not touch it. Sure you could explain burning, heat, hell you could get into the physics of energy transfer on the atomic level. But it wasn’t a lie of omission because you didn’t describe it in detail. Maybe a shitty parent though. 

But this is all wildly divergent from the original part about the Emperor’s rationale to ban religion. Chaos encourages corruption of religion to their own gain as you yourself stated. The reason the Emperor banned religion in the Imperium was to thwart those attempts.",1598154027,"the lack of daemon activities in the listing of foes by both aeldari and human constructs of the time coupled with the sudden and catastrophic downfall of humanity caught unaware and unprepared for daemonic forces.","unaware and unprepared","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unprepared","unprepared",NA,NA,1

The inexperienced and insecure only understand strawmen that they can easily dismantle within their highly limited frameworks.

*”Elitists hate any metal that is different!”*

(Translation: Someone didn’t approve of a a band whose style is so forced that it even makes crunk core look organic. I’ve never heard of The Body, Gnaw Their Tongues, Negative Plane, Palimpsest, Jordablod, Pan.Thy.Monium, Imperial Triumphant, Moëvöt, Sigh, Pensées Nocturnes, Nuit Noire,  The Schizoid, Maieustiste, Raspberry Bulbs, Nazgûl, Nishaiair, Pavillon Rouge, This is Past, Reveal, Leech, Lugubrum, Daggers, Oksennus, Portal, Curse of the Golden Vampire etc. nor would I like any of it, because when I refer to music that is “different” I actually mean normie music and VEVO pop that has been forcefully amalgamated with lowest-common-denominator “metal” into a new gimmick by big producers aiming to target tourists, outsiders, and the inexperienced. I don’t really like when legitimate new boundaries are pushed so I gravitate towards established/redundant sounds that are paper mache’d together strictly for the sole purpose of novelty and/or marketability. So when someone doesn’t like the McDonalds “metal” I mindlessly consume, I cope by accusing them of not liking a band/artist for being “different,” as I lack the ability to distinguish between something “unique” and something “contrived.”)

*”Let people listen to what they want!”*

(Translation: Someone just shared a personal opinion that I don’t share. I feel that only people that want to suck given band’s dick should be allowed to express an opinion as it’s more often than not closer to my own. I’m insecure in what I like, and am constantly seeking the approval of others. When I hear that a band is vehemently disliked by a total stranger I become disillusioned and begin to doubt why I like the band. This may make myself and others like me stop listening to said band. Unlike other people who can hear a dissenting opinion and not give a fraction of a fuck, I somehow believe that negative opinions stop myself and others from enjoying things...somehow... Because of such, I try to shut down and shame any thought contrary to my own and make sure to frame anyone who doesn’t like what I like or share their dislike with only the most delicate and dainty words as an “elitist” who is somehow preventing others from listening to something simply by the act of stating that they don’t like it. If I paint the contrarian as one who is somehow physically preventing others from doing whatever they want to do, I believe this makes me look morally righteous. My fragility is palpable, but that’s pretty metal... right, bros?)

*”You only listen to [insert 20-part-ridiculous-genre-salad].”*

(Translation: l don’t understand/can’t accurately distinguish between any hybrid genres such as black/death, crust/black, death/doom, etc. as I’m not familiar enough with metal (or music in general) to make any meaningful distinctions so I must deride those who do understand... and someone just razzed my ignorant ass for saying that Slipknot is Death Metal.)

*”You don’t like bands with more than 10 monthly listeners.”*

(Translation: I can’t pinpoint any difference in quality between Gojira and Infernal Coil as I’m painfully unaware and unversed when it comes to Death Metal as a whole, so I assume that the reason “elitists” dislike the bands I mindlessly worship must only be strictly based on how many fans/the exposure each band has. Never mind that I would use the  exact same reasoning I’m strawmanning against to talk shit on the popularity of Billie Eilish, Nickelback, or Taylor Swift as being lowest-common-denominator music-by-numbers for people who’ve never once tried to explore anything beyond what they’re spoon-fed (not that I’ve ever even tried to rationalize my thoughts that succinctly). Also, I legitimately believe the reason that Metallica lost cred amongst “elitists” with the “Black Album” has nothing to do with compositional style, and everyting to do with how many people -who wouldn’t be caught dead listening to thrash before- suddenly got into them for apparently no reason at all. Thus my conclusions are not that I have basic-as-fuck-entry/pleb-level tastes, but that others who don’t worship the same polished turds that I do only refuse to do so because the band is “popular” and no other reason whatsoever.)

*”You only listen to albums recorded on a potato.”*

(Translation: My ears are untrained (or perhaps “conditioned”) by *AT LEAST* a decade and half of listening to over-produced radio-pop and my sensory ability to distinguish between different sonic variations is completely stunted. I’m not used to using my brain when listening to anything (or most of the time) thus I recoil anytime something isn’t spelled-the-fuck-out for me in THE most accessible way imaginable. Unless it sounds like it was recorded in a Virgin studio by the same team who mixes Taylor Swift’s albums, I’m incapable of comprehending it, so it’s easier to just mock things that make me feel insecure and like I’m on the outside. Also I think that saying potato makes me look funny and quirky, like it did in the fifth grade.)

"g16ehs5","Dancers heaved in laser slathered frenzy far below the lighting scaffolding of the arena. From their high perch the Masters Entertainment personnel, dressed in the stage appropriate jet black, breathed deeply luxuriating in the fervent mix of emotion and pheromone that rushed up from below. Flecks and moments of the lives of the supplicant humans below flashed through Esther’s mind, a particularly good bowl of soup still tasted, the salty lips of a lover, the feel of the soft fur of a Vagan RealPet™ under a hand, warm evening sunlight on the skin. Whirling and whirring they suffused her and consumed her just as she fed on them.

“Whoa there newbie. You take a tumble down there and you’ll sour the mix.” A large hand came down on her shoulder. Nobel smiled at her, his white teeth gleaming under his dark skin. “Their enjoyment, their entertainment comes first. The Covenant demands it.” He shook Esther’s shoulder a moment and the hedonistic fog cleared from her head. 

“The Covenant…” Esther’s voice was lost in the violent rumblings of the song changing down below. Neon pink threw everything into stark relief and elation surged up, making her light headed. She let herself be guided by Nobel’s firm hand, along the gangway and into an opening in the wall of the boxy dancehall. The assault of light and sound cut away, leaving Esther with ears ringing and spots dancing in her vision. 

Nobel stretched, trying to ease the tension in his shoulders, he’d caught a whiff of a problematic person below. Someone with intent to ruin the good time that sustained his brethren come coworkers. He eyed Esther, questions bubbling around the corners of his mind. She was a head and a half shorter than him and possessed a build not at all in his opinion suited for Security work. She had the look of some sort of model, more apt to be dancing on the stage below than handling the baton and pistol strapped to her harness as his own were. 

“What made you decide to join Security anyway?” Nobel asked, leading the way to the lifts down to the dancefloor. 

Esther tilted her head and rolled her eyes, she’d been asked this question every single day of her induction. “Because I want to be a SheepDog, because I’ve always wanted to be a SheepDog. Because protecting the flock means we all get to eat.” She bristled, her dark green eyes glowing slightly in the dim lighting of the corridor. 

Nobel nodded, all good reasons. The pair piled into the small two person elevator and Nobel smiled again, his new partner seemed to be more of an attack dog than the herding sort. *Fitting*. Nobel thought to himself.  Motus-Victus, a branch of Humanity twisted into being forced to feed upon those who would become their flock by the nebulous evil that had masterminded the two Fantasy Wars. Saved from extinction by the enigmatic Ensurgeon and given a place within his grand order. He took them, as wolves from the wildlands and fed them. Not in the way they had once fed, in riots of blood and violence, but in the way that their bodies demanded to be fed with pheromone and empathic parasitism. The wolves became the guard dogs enshrined in a subsidiary of the Librio Conglomerate, Masters Entertainment, a firm staffed entirely by their kind hosting the biggest and best concerts, raves and events on any of the Plates. 

Events became feeding grounds, bottomless troughs to sate even the largest of appetites. Their flock would give away what they needed, unaware and unknowing, even paying Masters Entertainment for the privilege. Thus when the children of the MV came of age they would join the company, either as Security, Sales, Planning or Public Relations. Colloquially known amongst their kind as the SheepDogs, Hounds, WorkingDogs, and Lapdogs. 

The elevator doors slid open and the sounds of the dancehall reverberated in Nobel and Esther’s chests. Shrugging on their carbon black jackets emblazoned with SECURITY front and back the pair dove into the crowd. Deftly weaving through the crowds Nobel’s voice whispered through Esther’s communication package. 

\`You’re looking for the smell of a predator, hot iron, blood.\`

Esther paused and the crowd undulated around her. Searching with her eyes and her nose through the milieu of flavours surrounding her. When she found it, it lanced through her nose sending electrical shivers down her body.

\`There, he’s heading for the stage.\` Esther shot back, her legs already pumping.

From the stage Sudo watched the crowd, hips swaying, body on autopilot as she performed her set. A notification pinged in the corner of her vision. A security alert, pattern B, Security in pursuit of an undesirable element. Inwardly she smiled as the lighting pattern changed, switching over to Secure Pattern B, strobe lights blasted harsh white light across the crowd reducing all motion to a slideshow of moments.

Esther, practically on all fours slithering through the crowd at top speed.

Nobel disrupting the edges of the crowd with his bulk.

Sudo’s silent communication with her DJ brought the tempo of her song higher and higher, her voice soaring through octaves as the crowd surged in response. The slideshow continued, smoother now as the flashes accelerated. Sudo loved this part. 

The deviant had reached the front of the crowd, staring at Sudo. 

Nobel rounded the crowd control barrier, baton in hand,  his deep olive skin shining grey in the harsh lights. 

Esther completes a 270 degree turn around a clump of screaming fans.

Sudo’s song reaches its crescendo.

Esther comes up from below the deviant, eyes shining even in the dark.

Nobel has a fist full of shirt.

Darkness.

All three are gone in the few second interval of the song change. Sudo smiles, gathering herself to whip her fans into an even greater frenzy.

Later, Nobel and Esther watch the Plate Security Forces van round a corner. Night had fallen since the event began and a fine mist of rain drifted lazily upon the cool air. Both of the SheepDogs steamed slowly under it, wafts of vapour winding upwards under the sodium haze of the lighting at the rear of the complex. It had been a short hunt, the troublemaker looking to ruin the night for everyone by putting unneeded holes in their stage performer. 

“I get it now.” Nobel laughed, with a slap on Ether’s back that shook her footing.

“Get what?” Esther asked, back still vibrating slightly from the adrenaline running through her.

Nobel fixed Esther with a stare. “It was impressive, your hunt. You’ve just got to run haven’t you? You were smiling the whole time. No nerves, no hesitation, just perfectly there in that moment.”

She was still smiling, Esther realised as she wiped at her mouth in a vain attempt to grasp at the kind of stoicism that came naturally to Nobel. “I… yeah.

"g143onc","I just don’t see her as kind hearted as you do. Good intentioned? Yes? Self centered and unwilling to work hard? Definitely. I see her avoidance of avatar state as a result of her prodigy complex, which becomes exceedingly frustrating and obnoxious in season2. She can’t learn the avatar state in a day? Guess I’ll I’ve up and use this new information as leverage to abandon my teacher for a new way out. 

Unlaq’s vocabulary the entire time was somewhat inflammatory and zealous and heavily foreshadowed his takeover of the south, and poor intentions. He very particularly leads Korra towards leaving everyone behind for him, and he exposes a truth, but after romanticising his personality. He’s honest but still telling warped truths. And basic instinct would entail one to question an opposing figure who you barely know.

Her decision making is erratic. She decides to try and go around everyone’s back and fuel a conflict, then alienating her own friends when they don’t support her erratic behaviour wholeheartedly. 

Yes tenzin’s arc is a result of this, but he still knew the important things he needed to teach her. Things Unlaq didn’t know about the avatar state that were essential to her teachings.

She consistently puts her emotions in front of her role as the Avatar (again, she already should’ve learned to control that after season 1), in a messy repeated arc that fails to live up to what her character was. She was hot headed, prodigious, and spiritually unaware, and she was confronted with a reality that she couldn’t rush in. But instead of any change from that in season 2 it just gets bad to the point where it’s painful. 

I would also like to say that she fails repeatedly under pressure and those choices that give her more control? They seem more prone to backfiring than success.

And you say that Korea chose Unlaq for his spiritualism solely, but how would Unlaq know anything about the Avatar state? Where is any logic supported by that? He never once claims to be able to do that, and that is what she should’ve been doing. That avatar state mastery would have been miles more important if she could stomach her fragile ego and just work through her conflict instead of just sending people away.

And call it intentional all you want, I’m gonna go with season 2 being just a mess from front to back. Aang had to restore her bending because they backed themselves into a corner and there’s not a single other person who could do it. It’s the biggest writing mistake in season 1, but it has nothing to do with doubling down on her flaws and making her borderline unwatchable in season 2. You would think after making a deal to duel with someone and getting captured, then almost becoming a completely useless avatar thru lack of bending because you weren’t careful, you would not blindly put yourself in a position where you were vulnerable because you feel you’re invincible and morally right. But she does and she never remotely questions things that should be basic. WHY is there a seal only the avatar can break? WHY does this man show up and preach like a liars’s pastor, etc. She’s completely oblivious to whatever isn’t right in front of her to the point where it’s ridiculous. Not putting yourself in risky positions because of twisted politics was absolutely a lesson of season one. Or at least it should’ve been. 

You keep talking about her insecurities, but that doesn’t make any sense either. If someone kept exploiting my insecurities I wouldn’t perpetuate them. I would look inwards to find the reason for these problems and deal with them, which is really common human sense. And something air nomad culture is good for. 

Korra doesn’t treat the people around her as human, and chooses the seemingly flawless new figure against all those who helped her before. 

She may even be nervous because of the last season, but if she was nervous wouldn’t it make sense to question another zealous politician? 

And I disagree with your lesson in book one, because she got burned  in book one for standing without thinking. So how could that be a new thing to book 2? 

I do understand her character, she feels vulnerable in the bigger world she wasn’t exposed to, that’s present from episode one of the show, but that doesn’t explain some poor writing decisions that go against genuinely basic human instinct and common sense for the purpose of plot devices. 

Also I’m pretty sure the only thing Tenzin lied about was who decided she should learn from a compound, saying it was aang when it was really them. 

And I think you should rewatch early book 2 episodes, because his (Unlaq’s) behaviour and attitude is not that of a good man. Spiritually aware? Yes. Trustworthy? Maybe not so much because he acts exactly like Tarlokk in the political archetype he upholds in the beginning. He does pick and poke repeatedly and create a sense of superiority towards the southern tribe she grows up in, a  red flag in my book for someone whose supposed to be the avatar and not support zealous powers. Yes Tonraq and Tenzin admit to being wrong, but Unlaq creates stress points and time ultimatums like “you have to come now”, etc that place her under a nuanced pressure that I couldn’t stop relating to Tarlokk’s attitude. Korra was being played from the beginning, and Tenzin/Tonraq were both his pawns. Unlaq does not give Korra time to think on these problems, and Korra no longer gives them human traits, and simplifies them down to unworthy.

I would also like to say that she certainly wasn’t mentally ****** because of her parents or Tenzin, at Keats I don’t see it that way at all. Being sheltered has little to do with her by the time season 2 starts, and she certainly wasn’t ****** in season one by it. 

I can see some of what you say as intentional, but more often than not it seems like writers failures to establish a cohesive plot after season 1 ended because they painted themselves a corner.",1597162415,"she was hot headed, prodigious, and spiritually unaware, and she was confronted with a reality that she couldn’t rush in.","unaware, and she","unaware","and",TRUE,"prodigious , and spiritually unaware","prodigious","spiritually",NA,0

Therefore, we’ve probably all met at least one person with bipolar disorder of some kind in the past year, and probably don’t even know they have it. 

Even when completely unaware and untreated, a bipolar sufferer doesn’t exhibit symptoms every day of their life, and even when acutely suffering, mania or hypomania is only part of the cycle of mood issues. That’s why it’s quite difficult to watch both Kanye and Elon right now, because to people who’ve had a little bit of experience with the disease can see that they are clearly suffering mania or hypomania at the moment, though both of them personally probably feel pretty great right now. This is the hardest part of bipolar for the outsider looking in - the sufferer is feeling wonderful, happy to not feel depressed right now, etc, but they might be saying or doing things that make them seem ‘crazy’, ‘mean’, ‘arrogant’, or ‘stupid’. This can ruin the persons reputation if people are not compassionate and/or do not understand bipolar. Kanye and Elon are clearly very talented and intelligent men, and I’m speaking out about these generalised symptoms of bipolar in the hope that people can understand that these behaviours are part of untreated illness, and that we shouldn’t mock or dismiss them, we should instead try to encourage them to get some treatment and not to make potentially damaging decisions in the moment.",1595718083,"even when completely unaware and untreated, a bipolar sufferer doesn’t exhibit symptoms every day of their life, and even when acutely suffering, mania or hypomania is only part of the cycle of mood issues.","unaware and untreated","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and untreated","untreated","completely",NA,1

YOU said, in your OP, that you try to educate men about the nature of squirting, because its ""pee"". You use scientific papers and references to try and support this. So your premise is as follows : 

1. Squirting is pee (urine)

The common consensus of culture is that urine is disgusting. It is avoided save by fetishists, who are generally disliked and looked down upon. 

So the second premise that follows, from YOUR DEFENSE and position that porn including squirting porn necessarily as a classification of porn, is as follows : 

2. Urine/pee is gross. 

THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONCLUSION from these two premises is that squirting is gross. 


If you didn't mean to imply squirting is gross, then you should have recognized that what we were trying to tell you the entire time was that by arguing and trying to convince people that SQUIRTING is *literally* pee,

 (even though this is an inaccurate description, I could do a chemical test and tell you that it is not even close to the concentration of what we consider actual pee)

You are putting both women and men in a very hard place. Women, we will feel disgusted by our bodies because we cant always voluntarily control it, MEN, because they might not like urine, and therefore feel self concious about their attraction to squirting.

You are not ""sex positive"". Where have you said anything about us feeling comfortable with our bodies and our relationships in regards to squirting?

"fyob40c","&gt; Redundancy is an element of good engineering. Monopolisation (which is the opposite) is a fundamental element of psychopathic Capitalism. You're right of course, sadly.

I'm an ""engineer"" who grew up with a dad who worked for Ma Bell.  I don't want to design and deploy a water fountain without it having at least one backup system (along with a bunch of AT&amp;T docs on how to use it properly).  There are some places (well, lots of places...such as incarceration as you pointed out) where ""psychopathic Capitalism"" is Bad[tm].  Building bulletproof systems is one of them, because they're never going to be maximally efficient from a cost perspective for the same reason that you have to legally require people to carry certain types of insurance.

&gt;  If I were him, I'd sit in the Kremlin slamming lemon Baltics with a very quiet and self-satisfied smile on my face, while I waited for America to completely socially and politically collapse by its' own hand.

Well, it might not hurt to help *guide* that hand a bit.  But why take the risk and spend the vast amounts of capital required to destroy your enemy when all you have to do is maybe give it a little nudge.

Doesn't mean they don't want to destroy us.  It just means that unlike traditional capitalists, who act like addicts who want what they want and want it now, they're content to play the long game.  They've been working on this project in earnest since no later than 1930s.  What's another 5 or 10 years between old comrades, comrade?

(I have strong feelings about capitalism, communism, socialism, and democracy that are outside of the scope of this discussion, but I really do scratch my head at the way my fellow Americans look at and approach these issues.)

&gt;corporations make money from destroying the environment, not repairing/restoring it.

Even if they don't outright make money from destroying it, they're not going to make as much if they avoid it, which goes against the tenants of Maximum Capitalism.  If it was necessary, the market would fix it, right?  Consumers would penalize firms that damaged the environment while rewarding those that worked to fix it if it mattered, right?

That's why you use your position in the market to make sure that consumers get propaganda instead of real information and aren't incentivized to make changes.

&gt; The truly schizoid element of that story, is the UN thinking that they remotely have a prayer of pulling it off.

The UN is, I don't know, the UN.  It exists as a farce unlike any other, regardless of how you feel about its mission.

It's good to look at this whole thing with a critical eye, obviously.  And human nature can be horrible.  But when people actually know each other face-to-face, they tend to work cooperatively.  Unless you're a sociopath, you're going to recoil at the idea of killing your neighbor, raping his wife and daughters then selling them into white slavery, and using his pre-pubescent sons for bear baiting if you've actually sat and had a meal or a beer with him.

The dust jacket to the Gelders' book says: ""Neither of these authors is or has ever been a member of any political party. They have made their journeys in China and Tibet not as guests of the Chinese Government but as completely independent writers."" The Gelders' previous book, about the Chinese Communist revolution, Long March to Freedom, published in 1960, was very sympathetic to that revolution and established their credentials sufficiently with Chinese officials, such as Zhou Enlai, that they were chosen to tell the story of the “peaceful liberation” of Tibet. Despite the claims of the dust jacket and their affecting of an objective attitude, they were clearly leftist in their political viewpoints and they were indeed guests of the Chinese Government. They were also very obviously flattered to have been the first foreigners allowed to go to Tibet since shortly after the 1959 revolt. They were undoubtedly influenced by the treatment they received there and by the exclusive opportunity this gave them to interpret for the outside world the ""reality"" of Tibet. Everything the Gelders learned was through their Chinese interpreter, assigned to them by the government.



The Gelders' claim of objectivity quickly unravels when, shortly after their arrival in Lhasa, before they even began their supposedly objective inquiry, they write: In the onlooker who has never visited Tibet the self-exiled priests and lords may evoke sympathy as refugees from a happy country in which the people lived under their rule, inspired by a humane religious philosophy. The truth is that this society was a harsh and cruel tyranny in which, because they share the universal instinct for survival, the people made the best of their lot. Serfs of the European Middle Ages did no less. Jews in Hitler's concentration camps did no less. …But the indomitable fortitude and optimism of oppressed human beings in Tibet or anywhere else can only be confused with contentment by those not personally involved in their lives or who profit by such subjection and exploitation. One may wonder how the Gelders became such experts on the reality of old Tibet after only a few days of a visit to a society that had already been overturned under Chinese rule. One also wonders at the comment that only those not personally involved in the lives of Tibetans could mistake their oppression for contentment. The Gelders were not personally involved in Tibetans' lives, so perhaps they refer to the experience of the Chinese in Tibet. Their portrayals of the Chinese working in Tibet are entirely positive, while the Tibetans are portrayed as formerly oppressed and now liberated and making a new life, but still dirty and smelly. The Gelders make much of the eyewitness veracity of their own account of reality in Tibet, while dismissing the accounts of native Tibetans in exile in India. The Gelders seemed unaware and unconcerned about the fate of any, whether still within Tibet or in exile, who had opposed the Chinese ""liberation.""


The Gelders were so confident in their objectivity and perspicacity that they imagined they could not be deceived. However, this is disputed by at least one Tibetan who was there at the time. Kunsang Paljor was one of the young Tibetans sent to China for schooling in the 1950s. After the 1959 revolt he and many of the Tibetan students in China were returned to Tibet. He worked at the Tibet Daily from that time until 1969 when he fled to India. Kunsang Paljor revealed that a special notice was given to Tibetans in preparation for the Gelders' visit: Some foreign visitors will come to Tibet from Peking very soon. No one is allowed to talk to them without a specifically approved reason. Only Chinese officials along the route of their visit have the authority to speak to the foreigners. If there are any unpleasant disturbances the criminals will have to bear full responsibility. Everybody must wear the chuba and look happy. 7 According to Kunsang Paljor, when the Gelders arrived in Tibet many Tibetans wanted to pour out their grievances to them but were unable to do so: Because of the intense suspicion that the Tibetans might seize a chance to hint at suppressed facts of life in Tibet, the Chinese were very particular about the 13 preparations for the Gelders' visit. To this end the Chinese succeeded in leaving the visitors ignorant about the real conditions in Tibet. The Tibetans, on the other hand, felt that since the foreigners did not know Tibetan, it was difficult to tell them about their grievances even if the opportunity was available.



Chomphel Sonam, in Tibet under Chinese Communist Rule: A Compilation of Refugee Statements (Dharamsala: Information and Publicity Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, 1976), 89.



Kunsang Paljor said that the Gelders' interpreters were briefed to ignore any Tibetan who attempted to make unauthorized contact with them. He said that Drepung was reopened just for the Gelders' benefit. Thus, the ceremony there that was attended by many Lhasa Tibetans and presented by the Gelders as evidence of religious freedom was a staged event. This information substantiates the probability that their encounter with the “tall lama” was also staged. Another Tibetan, Chomphel Sonam, wrote that ""during the arrival last year [1962] of some British newspaper reporters"" the remaining monks of Drepung were allowed to hold religious assemblies in order to show the visitors that the Chinese were respecting religious pursuits of the Tibetans. Kunsang Paljor said that some of the ""liberated serfs"" with whom the Gelders spoke were semiprofessional propagandists cultivated and instructed by the Chinese in the accounts they should relate. He said that many of the sites to which the Gelders were taken were showpieces specially set up by the Chinese for propaganda purposes. He also said that the Gelders shared the typical Chinese opinion of the uncleanliness of Tibetans while ignoring many of the similarly unclean habits of the Chinese. Kunsang Paljor wrote that he was astonished upon his arrival in India to find that the Gelders had written a book in which they ""had swallowed the Chinese lies and glib talk without reservation."" He said that the Chinese had exploited the Gelders in order to deceive the world about Tibet and that the Gelders were nothing more than apologists for the Chinese atrocities in Tibet. He said that the ""timely rain"" that the Chinese brought to Tibet was a ""savage flood which destroyed our religion, culture, customs and everything dear to us."" And he condemned the Chinese as ""in the whole world the cleverest nation at lying and deception.""

Black people really did try to pull themselves up by boot straps and build a society that they could prosper in. But unlike the ending of other slave trades throughout history black people were terrorized and anything they built was destroyed and several laws and ordinances were put in place by local and federal govts to make prosperity virtually impossible. For instance look up Red Lining which is still legal today in 2020 and how banks have statistically supplied sub prime loans to black and minority groups way more often in spite of their good credit history.

"fxebv9f","Oh great, I get to chime in here. As a journalist (reporter and producer), you are displaying a very narrow knowledge of the use and purpose of journalism.  
  
First off, in the United States (as well as many other countries), journalism is a protected right that goes hand in hand with free speech that helps to initiate the flow of information within society. Ideally, journalism is a public organization of public knowledge meant to inform those unaware and willing to seek this information and to uphold those involved with the information to the truth and fact of them. For example, a neighborhood is being plagued by a series of home invasions. It is the public's right to know, especially those living in that neighborhood. A public source of information can help keep them informed and take necessary measurements. People benefit off of learning and information.  
  
Second, information is valuable. It's a commodity. It is why countries have intelligence agencies. It can be things from as large as foreign policy issues or as small as little Suzy running a $1 lemonade stand next door. People find leaks valuable. Some people like to know what happens. You are not inclined to read them. This becomes basic economics. There is a demand for new information. Whoever provides a supply of it will reap the reward. The creators of any show know about this. This is why people who work on Marvel projects joke that a sniper will take them out if they leak information. It's hard to keep a secret under wraps when there are more people involved. That's just the truth. Marvel is willing to spend plenty of money to avoid leaks. Power Rangers cannot. Then again, you are not forced to read leaked material. You can ignore that. Stay away from places that will open you up to that. If you dont want to get burned, stay away from the kitchen.   
  
Third, your view of journalists is a narrow-minded view based on the actions of few journalists. Many of us work hard to uphold a truthful, factual, and ideally unbiased standard. But going back to economics, there is a demand for new information. You get clickbait articles, shock value stories, ignoring more interesting stories in favor of higher viewership ones, sponsored work, and ignoring journalistic ethics. Because of people like you, journalists are being barred from discussions (impacting the important flow of information), becoming misunderstood in their role in society, and are being forced to work roundabout ways to win over someone's favor just to talk to them. Putting journalists in a negative light has put us in harder positions to do our jobs in a way that doesnt make us ""assholes."" I've received death threats and was told that I would be beheaded for being a journalist. Not all journalists are bad, certainly not information leakers. Stooping down to calling them ""assholes"" and ""pricks"" over this is immature ad hominem. Of course it's for money, everyone has to eat, but we enjoy getting information out to the masses and educating people on fact, because knowledge is power. Again, you are not obligated to read the leaks. If someone else spoils it for you, that's not the journalists fault. The community made sure to use things like the #BeastSpoilers hashtag on twitter to keep this away from people like you.  
  
Maybe try not to call people assholes and pricks too, that's just beyond rude.",1594275792,"ideally, journalism is a public organization of public knowledge meant to inform those unaware and willing to seek this information and to uphold those involved with the information to the truth and fact of them.","unaware and willing","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and willing","willing",NA,NA,1

"fvoctkq","Some of this is due to a disappointing lack of scientific education among the public. Looking at the average American adult, I'd be surprised if 50% could accurately label a diagram of the basic organs in the human body. Asking a typical person to imagine the cells of their body working together for a collective goal is expecting a level of biological knowledge that is simply not important or interesting to them. I'd imagine the situation is similar in most countries.

Still, OP's idea has got some things going for it. Honestly, I hadn't considered the multicellular organism idea as support for socialism either. However, I don't know if the analogy holds up to scrutiny.

For one thing, cells can't be credited with an independent will. They are chemical machines that run on a DNA blueprint, churning out proteins and absorbing matter without any consciousness directing them. They are not aware, they make no decisions, and even their primitive instincts are driven entirely by their surroundings and their DNA. Even when collected into multicellular organisms, cells are still unaware and unable to exert anything approaching will.

Humans don't work this way. We can form and break our collectives, and we can belong to many at once. We move to new places, change occupations, build relationships with other individuals, and have intellectual capacities that we still don't understand fully. We like art and music, but hardly any of us agree on what looks and sounds the best. We don't simply exist in our environment, but change it to suit our purposes (and, of course, to our own long-term detriment in some cases). 

I don't think we should simplify humans to cogs in some larger machine. That feels too capitalistic to me. If we limit the analogy to merely demonstrating a socialist principle in nature - the virtues of collective cooperation - and don't take it further than that, then I think this is useful. But it does seem to be more of a counterargument than a point that stands easily on its own though. 

For example: If socialists present multicellular life as an analogy for socialism, then we expose ourselves to critiques ranging from ""What about apoptosis, do you mean that people should commit suicide for socialism?"" to ""If my father is a muscle cell then I'm stuck as a muscle cell forever, so this is really talking about turning us all into serfs in your commie dystopia!""

I'll say first this: I wanted to show her that when it comes to relationships, including ""sex"" (I mean that in the largest sense), women aren't men without penises.   The right woman should understand you, love who you are (rather than who they wish you were), be there for you in the little things and the big things, have your back no matter what, truly think you're beautiful when you're just awake, when you've been crying or sick, when you've been cleaning or running or building a deck, when you're feeling like you're holding on to twenty extra pounds of water.  I think women have different criteria for beauty, at least in each other.

I think one of her favorite things, one of her big surprises, about sex, is that I'm not working toward a goal, ever.  When we're snogging it isn't preparation to move on to the next stage, which is preparation to move to the next.  She was unaware and surprised that sex could work that way.  It makes kissing an entirely different act.  She didn't like kissing with her guy but she loves when we do it.  I don't think that's 100% because now she's kissing a woman, though I guess it could be.

She's not in love with shopping quite as much as I am but she loves the togetherness and we shop together well. 

 I think the whole idea of complete mutual vulnerability is new to her, and frankly I think it may be the most important thing.  You don't open yourself up to that without complete trust, and I don't think she ever could trust a guy nearly that much.  

What I find surprising is how much less men seem to be motivated to have a total emotional connection with their partners.  Or at least that's the case here -- I confess I've never been with a guy and I expect that like women no two are the same.  But I'm not going to have a relationship where it's not going to be mostly about connection, and I think we were both surprised -- she that I wanted to have so much connection with her emotionally and me that her guy didn't.  He was very sweet, very kind, a good man.  But she didn't really connect with him the way she needed to.  I just didn't understand why you would have a relationship like that.

I was surprised that he didn't share her interests very much.  I can't understand that either.  If she has a particular skill (in this case, for example, pottery) I want to dive into it.  He just never did care that much and I think it hurt her a little.  It was just a sign that as good a man as he was he just wasn't ready to be totally into her.  

I don't know if this is the kind of thing  you're asking about.  It's such a fascinating question to me.  As you can tell I need trust and emotional investment above everything else.  So if there are other things, I'm not thinking of those right now but I would love if you have specific questions for me that I could think about.

I'm going to spend the next couple of nights thinking about this!!!",1591895369,"she was unaware and surprised that sex could work that way.","unaware and surprised","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and surprised","surprised",NA,NA,1

That sounds like a victim complex. Why not empower women instead of teaching them that they are perpetual victims? Instead of teaching them to fear men why don't you teach women to defend themselves? teaching girls to fear their own shadow will not make them safe, it will make them paranoid and stunt their initiative and result in them being even more timid and victimized by actual predators who specialize in honing in on vulnerable behavior. 

I taught my younger sisters how to hold their own against men twice their size and I encourage them to be aggressive in their own defense.

Spending my upbringing in Tahoe taught me one simple truth; it doesn't matter where they are from, some tourists are fantastic and some are the most obnoxiously entitled and unaware people in the world. I think this applies to transplants, too.

"fr6hc2f","First: The population of those two countries combined is about 16% of the population of the United States. Of course they have the capability of testing FAR less people than are here. And on top of that, they don't have to deal with literally 50 different sets of laws, regulations and policies that make up a Nation like ours. Although I will say because of antibody testing we can start to get an idea of how many people have already been infected and didn't even know it (which obviously lowers the deathrate percentage). 

https://news.usc.edu/170565/covid-19-antibody-study-coronavirus-infections-los-angeles-county/

This study done by USC estimates, through antibody testing, that at the LOW end there could be as many as 325,000 people that have already had it but were unaware and as many as 900,000 people on the high end in LA county. This is obviously much higher than the confirmed 39,000 cases reported which lowers the deathrate by almost a factor of 10.

Second: 
 https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/22/covid-19-could-detonate-hunger-pandemic-with-millions-risk-world-must-act/

Here is an article from the Washington Post about how there could be as many as 250 Million deaths from hunger worldwide because of the disruption to the economy, food production lines, and the ability of people to get the food to the people that need it. You can't just shut down the world for a year and then bring everything back up like nothing happened. And if that isn't enough for you, what about the 370 million children worldwide that depend on school lunches to be fed because they don't receive proper nurishment at home ( https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062812 )

Third: You are correct that the United States government can provide dollars for a year if necessary. What you are not thinking about is the millions of people that need to work in order to get the food to the grocery store for you to buy it. Let's forget for a second the massive inflationary cost of printing that much money for a year (that's a completely different conversation), you still have farmers that need to produce the food, factories to process and package it, warehouses to distribute it, truckers to transport it and grocery stores to sell it. Not to mention all the industries needed to support those people doing all the work. Money can't buy what's not there. 

And lastly, please don't assume that because I am looking at one side of a bad situation and you are looking at the other that I am uninformed about the topic or that I am uncompassionate about people who are less fortunate than myself. I was once one of those unfortunate people and had to make choices like do I put gas in my vehicle so I can work or food in my belly so I can live. (For the record I chose food and biked to work for a week) So yes, I do care about people less fortunate than myself and take action in my life (that I do not want to discuss here) because of those experiences. Opportunity cost can be very ugly when discussing human lives but we don't stop driving because of the 1.25 million people that die in vehicle accidents each year because the cost of that would be too great.

But instead of fixing themselves (whether it's cosmetic surgery, hitting the gym and using steroids, getting a good stylist, even just having a fucking shower) they refuse to take responsibility and just blame ""women"".

Women do put looks first, because PEOPLE put looks first. It's fucking simple. Not being a dribbling autist helps a lot when you get to know someone, but looks are everything at first. 

Your issue is tragic, and I really feel for you. I'm sorry to say, but I assume having MD will severely impact your life and sadly,  it means many women won't find you attractive. But there might be someone out there, it does happen a lot. 

So NO, that does NOT make you an incel. The total opposite. You don't blame other people, you accept it is your disability that makes it difficult. I just feel genuinely upset that it isn't something you can help. You're living a very tough life, and have a very good outlook on matters. You're self-aware (in a good way) and not blaming other people. I don't want to come across as patronising here, so please believe I genuinely mean it.

Remember that in her mind you are someone who purposely hurt her and put her through worse pain. The reality doesn’t matter, with BPD it’s captured one way or the other in the extreme. It’s great on the plus side but equally out of proportion. I’d say the amount of time spent one way or the other is the reality of what she really thinks.

I don’t regret it, two wonderful kids and I saved my wife’s life twice, built many memories and suffered hardships, we have had many good times. 23! years later I met another damsel in distress, the woman right for my mind, and she also needs me, she has BPD or similar, it’s close.

I promise you I would have needed divine intervention to escape permanent, life altering trauma or something worse like suicide, because I would have loved her so much and not handled the whole situation in perspective. Please be careful about how you proceed. The way she makes you feel when times are good may be something you can’t find anywhere else. But it’s gonna be taken away at times like right now. You can’t expect a woman to sustain that much adoration without a break. You shouldn’t be addicted to that, when it’s out of proportion just enjoy it in perspective of the flip side, it ends up closer to any other relationship.

Astrology is composed of the pseudoscientific belief that human affairs and personalities can be predicted and are affected by the movements and relative positions of celestial objects. In more ancient times many followed astrology religiously, over time its prevalence and influence in society. Many people are passively involved in astrology through newspapers, occasionally having a read through their weekly horoscope which predicts your week’s experiences based on your star sign. The fundamental fallacy of astrology is its basis on several confounding factors, biases and ontological confusions. These include confirmation bias; naïve realism; illusory correlation; base rate neglect; availability heuristic; childhood concepts. Let us break these down in the context of astrology.

Firstly, confirmation bias is present because astrological predictions are most of the time positive predictions which we want to come true, so after you read a prediction you subconsciously are looking for it to occur. Perhaps one of the most relevant biases is illusory correlations as people believe a star or planet millions of light years away will determine their fate or behavior. The reason this correlation seems real is because astrological predictions describe seemingly individually tailored predictions which in fact are extremely broad and common occurrences. However, due to confirmation bias you will pay more attention and remember more of these events leading to naïve realism. Once someone finds their astrological predictions to be correct or after multiple times, they believe in it much more strongly and will defend its legitimacy through their firsthand experiences passing them off as evidence. When more and more people find their astrological predictions are also often accurate, what I call group bias forms where enough people loosely believe in the phenomena that no one questions it out of not wanting social arguments or being singled out. When a believer is presented with a prediction that turned out wrong, they look to their next prediction and if it turns out to be right, they quickly forget about the previous prediction and focus on the more recent one. This is a classic example of base rate neglect. Astrological predictions are formulated such that the events are very common to all people, so when one reads a prediction and it loosely or vaguely fits their experiences, they think it is perfectly true. This is known as the availability heuristic and goes hand in hand with confirmation bias, where a subject will make a strong link with the smallest similarity in their experiences and the prediction. Furthermore if as a child if you or your parents read your astrological predictions, at a time where you are unaware and most vulnerable to cognitive biases, you are more likely to strongly believe in astrology for the rest of your life. “. It’s like my brain has been hard coded/ conditioned into thinking about it.” demonstrates this.

A further confirmation of naïve realism, base rate neglect and availability heuristic is demonstrated in: “I have been reading and into it for almost 5 years now. …But far too many times (like 5 times) has it been eerily accurate”. So, in the 5 years you have been reading astrology predictions, you have experienced 5 correct predictions? Well this is astounding, because of how terrible your astrology source is. Most astrological predictions reach 30-40% accuracy due to their open-ended predictions. What is more eery is that you manage to only have one correct prediction per year.",1588513060,"furthermore if as a child if you or your parents read your astrological predictions, at a time where you are unaware and most vulnerable to cognitive biases, you are more likely to strongly believe in astrology for the rest of your life.","unaware and most","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and most vulnerable","vulnerable",NA,"most",1

"fot8lof","With the exception of shady agencies or ones that have no idea what they're doing, it's nearly impossible to get a job as a copywriter without a creative portfolio. Assuming the job is for a midlevel copywriter, you're even more out of your depth as you'll need to show actual produced work to get that job plus a couple years of copy experience. But let's say its for a junior role----&gt; Junior portfolios today are largely built by attending a post-grad portfolio school (or ad school), where you spend up to 2 years learning how to build one, and undergoing multiple creative internships. The proliferation of these ad schools means having portfolio + internships are a prerequisite at this point to break in as a copywriter or creative at all. It's THAT competitive. Because of this, it's highly unlikely to make the switch from any other department into creative. It's hard to make the switch from any department to another period because of how ad agencies function. But the switch to creative is especially tough, because of all the specialized education and trials it takes to get your foot into that door in the first place.

If you're in a much smaller market where there's only a handful of agencies and all of them small, competition may be significantly less. But I still don't see any creative director in their right mind hiring a copywriter without a portfolio.

Wuhan officials continued to emphasize through January 14 that no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission had been found. \[...\]** Wang Guangfa (王广发), a member of the expert group from Beijing, came out and stressed that the disease was “preventable and controllable.” In light of these statements, the public remained unaware and unconcerned.""
   * ""**Up to January 17, tourism authorities in Wuhan continued to launch the “Spring Festival Culture Benefitting the People Campaign” (春节文化惠民活动), issuing hundreds of thousands of free tickets to attractions in Wuhan in order to encourage tourists from all over the country to come to the area for sightseeing. Through to January 19, Baibuting Garden (武汉市百步亭社区), an area advertised as a model residential community in Wuhan, was still holding a Spring Festival banquet celebration for its 40,000 residents.** There was no attempt to stem the flow of people to Wuhan from all over the country and around the world. During what was the most critical phase for controlling the outbreak, Wuhan was essentially an open city owing to the efforts of local officials to keep a lid on the story.""
      * Mentre la Cina gestiva questa emergenza con i piedi e con i suoi soliti modi da dittatura, minacciando di prigione i whistleblowers e azzittendo le voci critiche, Tedros (il direttor-generale dell'OMS) il 28 gennaio se ne usciva con [questo bello statement ufficiale](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak) in cui loda, tra altre cose, ""la trasparenza"" del governo cinese. E non si è mica fermato lì: per la Cina l'OMS ha avuto sempre e solo lodi sperticate dal giorno 1 di questa pandemia.
      * E prima che qualcuno venga a dire ""ma era solo il governo di Wuhan ad essere oscurantista, non quello centrale, che invece è stato trasparente"" - vi invito a leggere questo articolo e il precedente.
* [**Fighting the Coronavirus Pandemic: China's Influence at the World Health Organization**](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/fighting-coronavirus-pandemic-chinas-influence-world-health-organization): spiega benissimo - e in maniera estremamente equilibrata - la lapalissiana reticenza dell'OMS a criticare la reazione cinese al coronavirus.
   * ""DG Tedros’ permanent and forceful endorsement of Chinese actions throughout the crisis has, of course, created a counter-reaction: the organization itself is now accused of having missed the opportunity to forestall a global pandemic. This is the result of two decisions. First, WHO’s failure to recognize proven human-to-human contamination until January 23 (and going along on [January 14 with China’s refusal to admit human to human contamination](https://twitter.com/who/status/1217043229427761152?s=21)), despite strong and persistent indications to the contrary, and alerts by Taiwanese health officials directly conveyed to the WHO. Second, the organization’s refusal to declare a pandemic until March 11, when 114 countries had already reported 118,000 cases. These decisions have had global consequences, as WHO guidelines are for better or for worse followed by countries and even by private actors who can base – and later justify – their actions from these guidelines. Such was the case for example in France, where public authorities were still saying there was no proof of human to human contamination on January 20. Beyond the issue of what WHO can do at times of epidemics, there is a ripple effect from its statements.""

&gt;Smoking, wearing multiple face masks, taking antibiotics or traditional herbal remedies are not effective against COVID-19 and can be harmful, the WHO said in a statement last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, China’s president Xi Jinping encouraged health workers in China to use traditional therapies in their fight against the novel coronavirus. On March 7th, China’s health authority issued new guidelines to fight the virus. **The guidelines state that traditional Chinese medicine should be used and encouraged.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**On the same day, the WHO changed the recommendations on its English-language website and the following day on other websites, too.**  
&gt;  
&gt;A WHO press spokesperson confirmed to Swedish Radio’s reporter Hanna Sahlberg that the recommendations were amended after a meeting in Geneva on March 4th in order to reflect that many people use traditional medicine against mild symptoms of COVID-19.

I went through the start of my last pregnancy so blissfully unaware and hopeful, and when I found out the baby was weeks behind and had no heartbeat I was hit by a truck.

I feel lucky that I have a toddler already and throughout the very dark first few weeks with this loss I had convinced myself she was enough and I don’t have to risk the heartbreak again.

We got pregnant again right away but I haven’t had the same amount of hope and excitement this time, at least until I get some confirmation from my OB, and even then I know I won’t stop worrying and preparing for the worst. 

I have found that being open and talking about my miscarriage more has helped me process and recognize that baby will always be apart of me. It’s also allowed friends and family to open up about their own losses that they don’t talk about too. 

What hurts now is seeing all the pregnancy announcements for babies from July to September. I think, must be nice, but then quickly correct my snark because I don’t know what any of them went through to get that beautiful pregnancy.

"fmhfkvr","Although I grew up reading comics; Beano, Dandy, Cor, Whizzer and Chips, Shoot! and 200AD I left the medium in my late teens.

The part works I moved to as an adult were GQ, Loaded and the like.

I dabbled with The Freak Brothers and Fat Freddy and his Cat, but not as a series, more collected - it was printed early '70s. In the UK Comic Stores were never present with ubiquity they were in the US, so it wasn't really a part of the culture, or at least my culture.

Pre-film Watchman, ***that*** I picked up as single book. It drew me back in, some twenty or so years later. I was unaware it had been printed as a part-work.

I then moved on to The Sandman. Which to me, was a collection of books. But to someone who has, for instance, collected the Tolkien series, it wasn't something I identified as being like comics, and again I was unaware and unconcerned of it's comic lineage.

Maus has been mentioned. I'd add to that much of Moore's work, none of which I would consider comics because they were not the form in which I consumed them.

I suppose the easiest definer is the presence of a spine. If it has a spine, it is a book, which I think of as a graphic novel.

No spine or binding, to me, it is a comic.



For my view then, this demands an answer to the question as to ""is a collection of comic-originated, monthly published, part-works, re-published collected in a bound form, a comic or a graphic novel?""


It kind of undermines my whole definition.

Now, comes the contentious part, but I opted to die on this hill, so be it.

The majority of DC and Marvel properties I consider to be comic book. The content is labeled comic book movies when it moves to that media and is a broad cultural identifier. This as someone who owns and appreciates The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum as well as Moore's run on Swamp Thing.

I very much doubt this is remotely close to your search for a consensus, but I suppose it would be fair to say: ' the content, the form consumed and the physical presence' is the basis on which I differentiate comics from graphic novels.",1586078086,"but to someone who has, for instance, collected the tolkien series, it wasn't something i identified as being like comics, and again i was unaware and unconcerned of it's comic lineage.","unaware and unconcerned","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unconcerned","unconcerned",NA,NA,1

&gt;Please define this.

Not being physically attached to someone else, while being unable to be removed through a non-invasive procedure. Newborns are biologically independent.

They cannot be individual, even if the rest of their timeline is biologically individual, or if they are philosophically an individual by having a complete set of DNA.

That’s a loose comparison, but isn’t consequential to any legal reasoning. DNA doesn’t change the longer it sits, it’s always what it was.

"fl0xbfx","**TD/DR**:

The best way to avoid divorce is, before getting married (and preferably before getting into any relationship at all), being *very* familiar with yourself and how/whether you're best suited to give to the other person with whom you're in relationship.

**Full Response:**

I was 21 at the time of my first marriage, and my emotional capacity probably equated somewhere around your description of yourself (fairly naive, feeling 'mostly okay' about getting married, etc.). In hindsight, the better question is, ""How do I know whether I'm ready for a romantic relationship?"" (forget marriage for a second...let's just focus on any relationship that's growing romantically at all)

Relationships should be two people becoming committed to giving to one another. The problem is that most people have a mindset focused on the benefits the relationship will bring them. That is, they're focused on themselves and, basically, taking from the other person. Note that 'taking' is different than 'receiving' -- 'taking' being based on (unreasonable) expectations of the other person, and 'receiving' based on grace and appreciation for the other person.

A relationship with two people committed to giving to, rather than taking from, each other is somewhat rare. Spotting this distinction is fairly straightforward *if* one knows the things to notice during the acquaintanceship, friendship, and/or long-term relationship stages. Most of us learn the hard way, whereas you're doing the prudent thing and seeking advice before you've wasted a bunch of time on a relationship doomed to fail.

In order to give to another person, you must know yourself, be comfortable with yourself, have lived on your own two feet completely independently by yourself, know your likes and dislikes, know your strengths and weaknesses, etc.

If you're unaware and unsure of your own self, then you will have a difficult time giving to another person to your best capacity. The whole ""opposites attract"" is complete B.S. For example, if someone knows he/she thrives emotionally in large friends groups, then it would be hard to give yourself to someone who prefers small groups, because you would constantly have a pull to be in different environments.

There are many good books I could recommend, if you'd like.

In this culture, at age 22, a person is unlikely to be familiar with himself/herself. Ironically, this especially holds true if the person is coming straight from college, since university life is *definitely* *not* real life. I tell my kids that, as a general rule they should be (1) on their own for about two to three years before they even consider marriage, much less actually be going through with marriage, and (2) have dated a person for about two years before they start considering marriage, because after the first year has passed you can probably start to see the ""real"" side of someone since the person has become comfortable with you, you've seen a whole cycle of indoor/outdoor seasons, holidays, etc. pass.

Regarding your question of emotional protection equating to a lack of commitment, I would they are not equivalent. If anything, you're doing the wise and right thing by assessing your own emotions, so that you *can* ensure you'll be committed to your marriage.",1584717725,"if you're unaware and unsure of your own self, then you will have a difficult time giving to another person to your best capacity.","unaware and unsure","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unsure","unsure",NA,NA,1

You stopped someone from being born. That’s not an appeal to emotion that’s logically and objectively murder, regardless of the stage of development it was stopped at. 

The pro choice arguments are also appeals to emotion and usually followed by accusations of sexism and supporting women being in pain.

"fkibc87","If it did, I was too unaware and euphoric to notice it. It had very interesting effects on my DID (formerly known as multiple personalities, which is a bit of a misleading title as they aren't separate personalities but rather fragments of a whole that failed to fuse in childhood and then further grew apart from each other, but dependant on each other to function in society or under stress etc).

[LSD connects the entire brain.](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-04-12/scientists-map-effects-of-lsd-on-the-human-brain-for-the-first-time) Because certain (or each, depending on number of alters and other factors) part(s) of the brain generally only activate when certain alters front (are in control of the body), activating all of them causes some interesting effects. I tried psycobilin only once in my life and the contrast was very interesting. 

For LSD, the alter fronting at the time totally disconnected from everyone else in the system from come up to come done. It was radio silent, no switching or microswitching, but nearly complete memory bank access. He couldn't remember everything all at once, but memories he usually didn't have access to would be accessible. 

I once had an alter suddenly start fronting when I peaked who hadn't ever fronted before and no one knew about before. He had been reliving the trauma that had caused  him ^1 for several years, over and over, but he never knew the trauma happened to ""him"" but instead thought the trauma happened to someone else as he watched helplessly from a few feet away. After a few moments of intense panic and confusion, he rapidly began gaining memories of what had happened since he was formed, and then of memories before he was formed, starting with the most recent memory and going backwards in time memory by memory. He suddenly realized that he was the person that he had watched during the trauma, and immediately looked in the mirror and had a panic attack at the realization (remember we were peaking). After the bad trip passed as they always do, he calmed down significantly and talked to our (now ex for unrelated reasons) partner who had been sitting besides us the entire time, and was *also* under the influence of LSD. After that he had a great time for the first time in ""his life."" We were living in a barn at the time and had been sitting in the car to use our phones as the charged, and then we walked down the hill to the barn and he saw nature for the first time *while on acid* and was so impressed by the mountains around us and the pasture we walked through down the hill that he took a video (I might be able to find it if I dig) of the landscape as he walked.


Another time, after we had come down, several alters temporarily partially integrated/fused for a few days in the worst combinations, but it gave them time to work out their differences.


    


Psycobilin was a different beast. Instead of one alter fronting, we temporarily integrated. Most people integrate their personality between age 6 and 9, and continue to do so until ~11. DID is what it's called when you *don't* integrate. We had never experienced it before, and because the fragments had grown apart and had separate experiences and reactions/development than one another, it was very unsettling and way too intense. Imagine if all the sanrio/hello kitty characters, the characters you've created and the NPCs from Skyrim, including the enemies, and they all became one person. That's the best I can describe it. Unsettling, conflicting, self loathing, terrifying, surreal, and *wrong*.


Others with DID have had different experiences. Many of my old friends had very positive experiences with both or either. I'm going to wait until I'm in a mentally better place before I try mushrooms again.

*DONT'S/ Negatives*

1. DON'T OVERTHINK OR OVER ANALYSE your interactions with an INTJ. They CAN sense this and it does put them off or annoy them if you're making it especially notable and trying to overcompensate if you misinterpret their responses or try to assume their intentions. 
2. DON'T rush things with an INTJ, if you do, you might lose the relationship. INTJs despite showing love/attention quite impulsively in a relationship, prefer a slow burn. The pace of your relationship seems quite ideal, as ENFPs and INTJs both value the 'Friendship to Romantic Pairing, ""trope""/ situation. 
3. DON'T get clingy. INTJs VALUE THEIR SPACE and if you're an ENFP your love and attention for others, can come off as overbearing sometimes. Don't overwhelm your INTJ, they might distance themselves from you without notice or explanation if they feel suffocated. That's why long term relationships with them should be slow and progress little by little, so as not to overwhelm them. 
4. INTJ can sometimes seem emotionally unaware and cold to ENFP

*Positives / DOs*

1. DO be vulnerable and intimate. INTJs sincerely appreciate the authenticity and intimate, deep discussions that ENFPs love to have. You will find at an interpersonal level, you truly understand each other. 
2. Both functions are abstract and highly intuitive. ENFPs' ability to psychoanalyze quite accurately and observe is admired and a capability shared by INTJs.
3. You can teach and learn from each other.
4. INTJs respect ENFPs moral awareness and ENFPs value INTJs rationale.
5. Like and understand each other's communication style.
6. Make decisions and judgments in a similar way.
7. ENFP reacts positively to experiences INTJs give them

When somebody ask for basic respect, and the nutter doesn’t give it, then that’s deliberate. When you get a dog and don’t educate yourself on the basics, I can’t see that as having good intentions. Also, when somebody is astonishingly unaware and disrespectful, intention means nothing to me. 

If you cannot respect your pet enough to know what it needs to thrive, that’s not love nor is it having good intentions. I can’t see it any other way. 

Birds are fucking smart. Long story but the tree in my backyard (more like a tall bush lol) has become the new breeding ground for birds. Northern mockingbird was the latest batch of baby birds that exploded in my tree. Love. Today there was a turf war. Hummingbirds dive bombing, 2 other species I couldn’t see clearly rusting around in there, mourning dove just trying to stay out of the way (think they live around my roof somewhere). 

Then the mockingbird comes back and starts making all these calls some of which sound like a hawk. I’m no expert but it seemed to me it was mimicking all these different predator birds to scare them off. So cool to watch. So smart.

"fjezr8b","This is where I want to point out that the weapon system does not equal the mission, nor should it.

From doctrine ¨Airpower is defined as “the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives.”

The pilot is a mere player in all this, not the only piece, but performing a key tasks that deserves honor it is due as a technically and physically difficult skill. But this does not equate to command potential anymore than a great football player can be a great coach.

The beginnings of the air force required the rated position and defense of the position to prevent unnecessary influence from leaders who were unaware and unable to grasp the potential of air power.

This has changed.  To quote Happ Arnold

¨We cannot rely any longer on the old precepts of the past, but must instill in our leaders of tomorrow the importance of having flexible, imaginative minds. It will not be sufficient for officers to be merely leaders—they must be thinking leaders, capable of adapting themselves to ever-changing and rapidly changing conditions.¨

I related so much to the main character and noticed similar behavior patterns and how the people around her reacted to her quirks, and it’s almost a carbon copy to how people react to my ‘quirks’ and subsequently Ian’s ‘quirks’. Watching Frances Ha (even on rewatches) still often makes me wonder if I’m being perceived as an obliviously unaware and emotionally immature kid in an adult body whilst simultaneously debating if I’m actually as smart as I think I am. It made me question how I’m perceived within society and given I’m not always happy with the fact that I can’t help who I am at times, it still makes me tear up. That movie was drenched in subtle and realistic melancholy and honestly made me more sad than Call Me By Your Name or The Florida Project just to name a couple of examples.

To be clear, you believe McCain personally directed his campaign to make Obama's skin appear darker, in an effort to foment racist division against Obama?

I watched the example ad they give in your article, and they also show pictures of Obama with seemingly much lighter skin in the same ad. Looking for more examples is proving difficult, do you happen to remember a more egregious showing of what you are talking about here that I could look for?

Could it be that high contrast/dark pictures of political rivals in attack adds has less to do with race and more to do with just the common human trope of dark=evil?

&gt; I suppose you'd also have me believe he was unaware and unable to stop his vp choice from inciting such behavior in her speeches and rallies as well.

I mean, from what I remember.... yea. By the time Palin was chosen as his running mate it seemed like he was not really in control any more, I certainly don't think he would have been allowed by the people running his campaign to criticize Palin, since their only defense against other peoples legitimate criticisms were cries of sexism.

&gt; that's not even broaching any of his shitty human hits of the past like love of the Contras, Insane Forced Birth positions, The Keating 5 Savings and Loan Scandals, Pushing for creationism to be taught in schools,

Like I said, I don't agree with his political positions, but I can recognize he was advocating for those things in good faith. There is a difference between being mistaken and knowing that you are wrong and not caring. One is open to change, evidenced by his opposition to Trump;

&gt; ""Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.""

He was not perfect, you could even argue he was a negative influence on the world, but he was clearly a much better person than every republican we have left today.

Michael was WELL AWARE about his legacy from Thriller onwards. He said they were seriously about the Thriller Short FILM so he paid everything and they used 35mm film. After his success, I can hardly imagine that he used video tape again for any short film, considering we have proof on countless making of videos and photos (PANAVISION!).

Even IF the final music video cut was edited in PAL/NTSC due to effects, if any estate has the power and money to EXACTLY reproduce them (not impossible!), then the Michael Jackson Estate. 

If any estate is unaware and ignorant of the potential or the existence and condition of their artists vault, then it surely is the Michael Jackson Estate! 

Film (especially after leaving celluloid out in the early 20th century as a base material) can live up forever, if stored properly. I am sure Michael took care of his rolls. I am not too sure, the estate does so. So if there is a ""right time"" to take care of those, it's as early as possible.

Considering color grading: depending on the film stock and lighting, I can imagine that this is how Michael looked during the thriller shoot (with his make up). I like it actually and it's refreshing to see him that clearly, even if we are used to the other colors from the beginning. I think they should not do too much with optimization, but rather leave the colors in their original state and work together with the directors for any further decisions.

"fh3ri9y","No worries.  I hope work goes well.

The article you cited is not a [primary source](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/primary+source) basically about more money to farmers; specifically soybeans and some other crops.  [Here’s a primary source that’s a public government site showing the decline of soybeans throughout years](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/agricultural-production-and-prices/?topicId=14829) this is from 1912-2018.  You read that right, *the decline of sales of certain crops from 1912 up until 2018*.  You can see the decline yourself.

Another source is a primary source and from the government.  It states:

&gt;”Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the third quarter, real GDP also increased 2.1 percent.”

This was released January 30th, and there will be another released.  This is public information, as I stated.

It refutes your statement and opinion article with the facts about the economy, this just the GDP; I can list more with primary sources and not an opinion piece.

It’s not your fault that there’s “news” out there like what you listed.  I outline why in another comment, but a lot is clickbait with very little substance or facts.  The GDP increased 2.1%.  The economy is doing very well.  Please cross-reference as some of these “journalists” are swaying things to keep their jobs.  The clicks generate money for them.  It’s a shame what some people have chosen to do to generate money (as far as “journalism”).

Also, I am open to changing my opinions, especially if I’m incorrect or my facts are wrong or outdated.  For instance, in another comment about scams I was corrected about a membership to a cam site...I was unaware and uninformed (so, ignorant), so the person who corrected me, I gave them credit and thanked them.  I was unaware and ignorant about how to suggest a full resolution for that person and with the help of another, hopefully they were not charged anymore money and called their bank.

That’s just one example, but I will and do change my mind when presented with better facts.

#TL:DR Primary sources listed to refute statements. The economy is doing extremely well, crops are producing a lot, but there’s been a decline since *1912-2018* on the crops listed.  Therefore, the article listed sways facts to fit a narrative and is not trustworthy.

"fgl3wz5","Okay first of all it's completely silly if you really think someone like Sandusky wasn't going to rape kids because he thought if he got caught they'd shut down the football program. Like there is already a pretty big deterrent to not rape kids and that's called prison and being socially ostracized and vilified for the rest of your life. 

If he still did it despite those consequences then he sure as hell wouldn't give a fuck about the consequence of the football program being shut down. 

Secondly, say they did shut down Penn States football program. Now say a similar child abuse situation happens at another school and the schools officials find out about it. 

Knowing that Penn States football program was shut down, do you think the schools officials will be more, or less likely to cover up a child abuse scandal? I'll tell you that them knowing that the consequence of a child abuse scandal is their schools football program being shut down, it's wayyyy more likely for officials to want to cover up and bury it if they learn of something similar going on in their school.

It'll actually do the opposite of what you think would happen and encourage people to cover up similar instances instead of bring them to light.

Not to mention it's punishing every single kid and adult who were completely unaware and innocent of everything involving the situation. 

Sandusky will die in prison, three school officials directly tied to covering up the situation were convicted and sentenced to prison, as well as having their professional and personal lives destroyed forever for being known as people who covered up one of the biggest child abuse scandals. Joe Paterno was fired mid season and his name was stripped from college football and his statue removed from Penn State. Instead of history remembering him as one of the greatest college football coaches ever, it will remember him for his involvement in covering for a child rapist.

I definitely see returning to school within the realm of the possible future, but of course as we all know it'll just take a bit of time to get the funds, even with the help of scholarships. My title didn't expand on the entire reason if my dropout, it's a bit of a long story but the base of it is just that--lack of funds. There are a few other factors that led me to that decision but that one stands above the rest being the most practical reason.

As someone mentioned, I definitely do have a perfectionist streak, that combined with my Scorpio Mars' desire to succeed mixed with my habit of second guessing and general Pisces antics has been holding me back. I have a cycle of being proud of myself and then comparing my work to better artists, being doubtful and nitpicking what I do, becoming too depressed/uninspired to work, eventually picking it back up again and continuing the cycle. Someone mentioned that networking is my key, and I definitely agree, I've made some friends who have fairly big names in that tattooing industry however I tend to fall short on my promises because of this pattern I keep falling into.  Part of me wonders if art is my real calling--at least freelance/a pure art-focused career--because of this, as if art is only a piece of the puzzle. Maybe art in general isn't what I'm meant to do. Maybe I'm meant to be an artist at some point, and then meant to move on and explore a new side to myself. Maybe art is the gateway to my creativity as a whole. And as someone mentioned before, maybe it is meant to coexist with my servant nature as an art therapist.

I really resonate with everything mentioned by everyone. I want to learn and know everything there is and I want to be a wise and respected person who makes some sort of change in the world, or at least leaves a positive mark. Of course I understand I can't achieve that without allowing myself to be in the spotlight from time to time, and as someone mentioned, I am very comfortable being in the background and feel uncomfortable being the center of both critique and praise alike. 

Honestly, I've been thinking of transitioning to writing instead of art for my creativity. With Wisdom, Knowledge, and Communication as keywords for my life on top of meaningful work, being a public servant, and the themes of wanting to leave a mark, I've started to wonder if perhaps a novel will leave me satisfied in this part of my life. The thought of creating a story with heavy undertones, hidden messages, and even an inspire story from the bare surface peak my interest, and as someone said, I LOVE travel and wish it was a part of my daily life, so book tours are something I daydream about from time to time. Art has always been my focus, creatively, but honestly I always did better and received more praise in English and Writing courses. I feel like it's a talent that I have been somewhat unaware and neglectful of simply because it wasn't what was necessarily pushed upon me.

Of course, part of me wants to live as a hermit in the woods just smoking weed and living off the land and not bothering society. Part of me wants to start a non-profit. Part of me wants to be like that rancher that is famous for his calming videos, just brushing his highland cows, Hamish and Kyloe. Part of me wants to be a park ranger. Part of me wants to be a spiritual leader or public speaker/advocate. Part of me wants to just travel and meet as many different kinds of people as I can and learn their experiences. Part of me wants to be a teacher (honestly my least favorite of my dreams simply because my entire family consists of teachers and I don't consider them to be good teachers, lol). Part of me, of course, wants to go back to college and take another crack at Social Work. I feel like all of this is associated with the fact that I never had a ""dream job"" as a kid, I lived in the moment and was a tomboy, a very outdoorsy kid who just liked to play with bugs and go canoeing and camping, but never worrying about who I would be. Social Work (well, technically Case Management) was my first real aspiration after going into therapy at 14 and realizing that I wanted to help others and looking up to my personal Case Manager.

But as everyone has said, I have a lot of time left in my life to explore and try to do everything I want. Nothing but society says I have to pick a single career and stick with it for the rest of my life. A user mentioned a lot of change would fall into my life and I definitely agree, dealing with it in the moment can be exhausting and entirely daunting, but change allows you to make your own decisions as to how we advance from there. We can either decide to fall back on old habits and old decisions or embrace it and try something new. And there's no rule that dictates we can't decide to make these changes by our own accord or that our choices will always be right, we just have to try something different or look at it from a new perspective.

While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengaging the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.

&gt;To win in 2008 we will need to mount two large campaigns. The first will use national, state and local media to define the issues and narratives that will ultimately shape the election—a progressive “Messaging Campaign.” The second will be a voter contact and mobilization effort in targeted states to move swing voters and mobilize progressive voters—a progressive “Mobilization Campaign.” A successful joint strategy must be developed and executed to connect the messaging component to the ground game.

&gt;Every “person of color” should read Podesta’s emails and see how they’re being used and manipulated. DEMOGRAPHICS IS DESTINY is a DIRECT QUOTE FROM JOHN PODESTA TO GEORGE SOROS

&gt;Email from John Podesta to Soros from WikiLeaks. Mass immigration is really mass incarceration of people who oppose population replacement to the required demographic shift in order to obtain a progressive majority. Minorities are being played and used for gaining power:

&gt;""An “emerging progressive majority” is a realistic possibility in terms of demographic and voting patterns. But it is incomplete in terms of organizing and political work. Women, communities of color, and highly educated professionals are core parts of the progressive coalition. Nationally, and in key battleground states, their influence is growing. Latinos and young voters are quickly solidifying in this coalition as well. But many of these voters are new to the process. All of these groups—in addition to working class voters and independents picked up in 2006—will require significant long-term engagement in order to keep them reliably on our side.""

"feus3bn","One day way back when I was in high school, I went out to my car at the end of the day (I was a senior so I could drive in). Normally I would meet my little sister at her locker and we'd walk out to my car together, but she had to talk to a teacher about something so I went outside to wait for her. 

15 minutes go by... 30 minutes.... 45 minutes...... I've been texting her every 10 minutes or so like ""where are you"" and ""??"" with no response. But there were some areas of the school where you can't get a cell phone signal, so I figured she probably just hadn't seen them yet. At 45 minutes, I was now worried enough to go back inside and try to look for her. 

So I waited at the closest exit doors for a few minutes, for someone to eventually walk by who could let me in. Once I got inside, I headed toward that teacher's classroom, and I ran into my sister in the hallway pretty quickly. I asked her where the hell she'd been, and she just looked at me with this... blank stare. It was like she didn't even see me.

She had just been wandering around in a completel daze, for nearly an hour, in this kind of dreamlike state. She was just super confused and unaware, and all she said was ""the rooms kept changing"". 

I got her out to the car and she eventually cleared her head, and I got more of the story out of her. Apparently she was walking through the hallways, and at the points where big heavy fire doors separated parts of the building, she'd go through the doors and be in the wrong place. Where there was supposed to be another hallway, there was a stairwell. Where there should've been a stairwell, there would be a normal hallway, or where she should've been at the top of the stairs, she'd be at the bottom. Every time she went through a doorway, it was wrong, and she couldn't find her way out. *""The rooms kept changing.""*

I’ve worked as an LMFT for almost 5 years, mostly as a couples’ therapist, and now I’m working on a doctorate, also in psychology. I’ve worked with many many many couples that have highly similar dynamics to the one the OP described.

There is no information in what the OP said that would suggest the wife is entitled. Or a STAHM. Or lazy.

"fctkpbj","There's a couple of things you can do. The obvious,  easy answer is crank up the levels, but that just encourages more grinding, so unless you're planning to implement a hard level cap and raise it every so often, it doesn't address the root problem. Still though, if you feel your game is too easy, you should probably do this a little bit regardless. Just keep in mind as levels get high, the difference between levels gets much smaller, i.e. fighting a level 10 with a level 5 is much harder than fighting a level 60 with a level 55. That's just how the math works out. 

The first thing you actually should do is crank up the trainer AI difficulty in your trainer types file. I think 255 is the maximum value. This ensures the AI is picking the right moves for the situation. You don't want the player running through the electric gym with water pokemon because the AI is too dumb to use thunderbolt instead of quick attack. 

There's a script floating around somewhere that lets you specify the EVs of trainer pokemon. By default Essentials gives trainer Pokemon (3/2 * Level) EVs in every stat. Crank them up, even past the 510 cap if necessary. 
 
Another idea to play around with is to restrict help from items. Don't give the player access to powerful healing items like revives and full restores, keep it to hyper potions and full heals. Don't give them access to X-items cause stat boosting is broken outside of competitive. If you really want to be cruel you can give opponents access to healing items the player can't get. 

Restrict player access to stat boosting moves. Moves like swords dance, dragon dance, calm mind, and bulk up are insanely strong and if the player gets one or two off in a battle they could sweep the opponent no problem. There's a few ways to actually restrict them including not including their TMs, removing them from Pokemon's learnpool, and making opponent Pokemon so strong you really don't have time to boost before getting KO'd. You kind of have to do this on a move by move basis and play test how broken each move actually is and how you want to address it. 

Finally, give the opponent strong pokemon that work well together. Give them high accuracy high power moves like thunderbolt and ice beam. Give them egg moves and move tutor moves that provide coverage. Give them hidden abilities. Give the Manectric overheat and HP ice. Give the Clefable unaware and cosmic power.

The method of delivery doesn't make much of a difference if the subject matter is wrong.  I'm arguing that the issue here is the subject matter is wrong and/or focused on teaching the wrong lessons.

If your focus in all subjects is on indoctrination in changing attitudes toward sexual preference and teaching social and racial justice, and then teaching reading, writing, math, science, history and government only as an afterthought or as a component of the indoctrination, student ability in reading, writing, math, science, history and government is never going to improve much.  Further, when you deprive students of the basic facts and discourage critical thinking, and instead teach reliance on ""thought leaders"" to tell students what they should think about things, they never learn the skills necessary to solve problems on their own.

...which is intentional.

This makes it clear that the dumbing down of the American public is no accident.

&gt; Making money is important up to the point that the money can buy resources. Which is important for the world to work. 

The education establishment in the US has been nearly completely controlled by the left for the better part of a century.  The left has positioned itself as the party government control and the party of handouts (financed by the productive).  Prosperous, content, informed citizens don't need or want handouts, they want government to leave them alone and to keep its hands out of their pockets.  Ergo, producing such citizens is not in the interest of the left, if it wants to maintain political power.

&gt; Also for the world to work, the environment must be protected. Not being educated means not understanding the science of climate change and voting in leaders who harm the environment more. 

The left doesn't want people understanding ""the science of climate change"".  If more people did, the left would lose their hold on them.

They want people worshiping at the altar of climate change hysteria, which is an entirely different thing.

&gt; This would be my biggest argument for education is that while it does not take big education to make big money, it requires big education to solve big problems. I don’t think you’re arguing against education necessarily. 

A young relative of mine I saw over the holidays recently entered the 9th grade.  Her grades in school are excellent, largely due to the dedication of her immediate family in educating her beyond what the school offers.  We talked a bit about how the American education establishment has dumbed down education, and I had her take part of this test, to demonstrate how much:

[1912 Eighth Grade Examination for Bullitt County Schools](https://www.bullittcountyhistory.com/bchistory/schoolexam1912.html)

She failed miserably, of course - as would virtually every high school graduate in the modern age, and the vast majority of college graduates.

The test above was given in an age where a high-school education was not a certainty, and was offered only to exceptional students - but the level of knowledge expected of students graduating the 8th grade was far beyond what we expect in the present.  ...and it was under the pencils of the people of the generation who took that 1912 test that the American space program was born - as was most of what made the US into the greatest nation in the world.

Do u really believe kids qualifying for the scholarships are going to come and blow up my family. Lol .. don’t you think your bigotry is clouding ur judgement a tad bit. 

&gt; They are not Pakistanis. They have their own country. Pakistan is not responsible for them. It's better is 1,000 Pakistani children benefit than 1,000 Afghan children. We have 22 million children out of school. Stop robbing Pakistani children of their future by financing the children of your enemies.

No no no sir ji, don’t stand on the shoulders of unfortunate Pakistanis to justify your bigotry. It’s not a good look. Be a man and own up to your bigotry. But since you won’t, I’ll drop some wisdom here I hopes that you and others like you may be educated. It’s a staple practice for nations to further it’s influence using various methods. US is an example of how a nation successfully creates pro self sentiments in a society’s influencers. Not only do they use aid, and NGOs to further their ideology and influence, they also dish out scholarships and training. You should know about many of our liberals who come back from US after having taken advantage of such scholarships and they toot the horn of US and their ideology. They even see training our cadets who go on to become generals and other high level officers in our armed forces as a strategic move that strengthens their foreign policy. This is what we intend to do with Afghans, a nation that is hostile to us. Last time we gained influence there by supporting the winning faction from their civil war. We will never see Afghanistan as a separate country who should do as it intends. It would be terrible for us, were we to let India’s influence in Afghanistan go unchecked, so we too will make attempts to grow our influence. These 1000 kids will live in Pakistan, learn our language and our ways, some of them will stay here, others will move back. From those that move back and become professionals and industry leaders we want them to have a favorable view of Pakistan. Some of them will be business owners, some journalists and other policy makers. If our agencies are worth their salt, some of them will even be on our Agencies’ payroll. 

For our own, we have scholarship schemes, we are attempting to increase enrollment at all levels of schooling. We are building schools. No sir, we haven’t forgotten our own. But it’s dumb to think that we remain living in our own bubble, unaware and unconcerned of the neighborhood we live in. This is how nations grow their standing.

"fbibyce","Okay, slow down for just a second.

1: my advice for abrasions is to find out what exact things cause these issues. Write them down. Once you can see them in front of you you can get a good idea of what's related and what sensory system is responsible for that. Congrats! You've just made yourself a sensory profile! This is the first step to making your life a little easier as you can now come up with ways to cope with this pqhe stressors.

2: drama is always avoidable. Often at times it's better for your health if you can avoid it. You should avoid things that you know you can't control. If you feel you have the power to change something, change it. No drama needed. Just change it.

3: will you get cancer? Well that depends. The best thing you can do is eat a healthy diet, exercise, avoid smoking, etc. If you get cancer even after all of that, you were probably genetically predisposed to it. But in saying that, you should see that as a great motivator to just do whatever the hell it is you want to do, without fear. The truth is that we all die of one of three key things. Organ failure, cancer, or alzheimer's. In fact, you could technically die tomorrow. A plane could crash into your house. China could drop a nuke on your city. But that's not an excuse to be fearful. In fact, the best way to think about being faced with one's own death is to live with absolute freedom. You know you're gonna die, so fuck it! Have some fun!

4: when it comes to hobbies, instead of focusing on really specific things, find about actions you like to do. Not necessarily the hobbies themselves, but the sensations. I personally like the sensation of movement, so a lot of what I do actually revolves around that sensation. I cycle, I love cars and I want to be a pilot. I love to move! Find out what sensations you like and you'll find an array of sources that allow you to feel those sensations. You love the visceral release of emotions? Perhaps something like Martial Arts, or maybe writing poetry or painting will be interesting. What about the feeling of peace and serenity? Meditation, fishing, kayaking, and Yoga all give you these feelings. What about a desire to make noise? Music, dance and even motor racing all fill those niches. It's best to see what feelings you like, as you can always get better at the thing whilst you still get an enjoyment from that feeling.

5: philosophy is a pretty tough game. For one I've come to the realisation that I'm an optimistic Nihilist. There isn't a point to life other than its fundamental biology, to make babies and die. This truth is fundamental. Right now, you're thinking like a Doomer, in response to this information you've seen that there's no point or purpose to existence. Schopenhauer's the classic philosophical doomer. He says that life is endless suffering, and there's two ways out of it. Either through the absence and abolition of desire, or through the consumption and creation of art. I used to be a Doomer, but I'm now a Bloomer. A person who knows that yeah, life is pointless, but at the Same time, if there's no point, then there's no need to worry about looking for a point. Just enjoy it for the experiences. The pain, the pleasure, and every aspect in between.

6: you wanna know something really satisfying? Alot of those things you've mentioned in your itemised list, are either fixable in your own world, or avoidable. Others are being ignorant? Take solace in the fact that you notice things, and weaponise that realisation. Take Greta Thunberg for example. She saw that so many people are unaware and ignorant of climate change, so she took a stand. Or rather, a sit. And others soon followed. Destruction? Well you can at least stop destruction in your own world by taking the points made destructive thinking and using that as a roadmap to de-escalate them. No friends? That's fine. You've got 66k friends here, and at least a few of them have been where you've been.  Fearful thoughts? You can either let the fear consume you, or you can take those fears in stride, and use them to change your life. I'm afraid of dying of cancer, I'm afraid of being on the operating table. So I'm going to do all I can to not be on that fucking operating table. I'm going to go our, get healthy, and live the everloving fuck out of my life.

7: you're not dead yet mate. See this moment as the bottom of how low you can go. You can only go up from here. That way you know that any step you take, whether it's big or small, is a positive one. It's going to make your life better and easier. Autism isn't nessecarily a curse, but it may feel like one. It will take a lot of fighting and a lot of self-reflection to find where you can improve and where you need to change, but eventually you will be able to succeed with enough hard work. Consider that two years ago, I was in the same boat as you. With the help of a doctor and a therapist, as well as my own desire to not be so gosh darn sad all the time, I got to where I am today. Fully employed, in a healthy relationship, and with a tight circle of friends who I would go to the ends of the earth for.

"fagjf1z","&gt;What the comment actually says is that Poland is more sexist, and that therefore men are more trapped in traditional roles, and suffer more from toxic masculinity.

Again, if that were the case then why is Poland higher than much more traditional countries such as Russia and Ukraine? ""Traditional roles"" are undesirable no question there, however blaming those as an umbrella term should never be a detractor from tackling the actual issues. And sadly it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  For example, take your point 1 and 2. These are examples of men being forced into the role of provider 

If that were the case than doesn't it mean the causes of this role aren't really ""traditional"" as of now and groups claiming to fight these gender roles are doing the exact opposite? The issue of family courts and alimony has always been labelled as a ""men's rights activists thing"" and people fighting for it have been branded as sexist. The very same groups that claim to fight against ""toxic masculinity"" have fought against joint custody law proposals in the US for example. ""Masculinity"" is obviously not what's causing these laws then.

The same happens with the way workers are treated. Every fight for fair treatment in the workplace as a gendered issue always talks about women's treatment in the workplace, despite men usually getting the short end of the stick here.

Both these cases are of modern causes, modern ideologies and modern movements in the fight for human rights. How can we call these issues ""traditional"" then? If the issue is men being mistreated in the workplace then we talk about men being mistreated in the workplace. If the issue is biased family courts then we talk about biased family courts. That way we deal with the issue regardless of the cause and whether it's ""traditional"" or ""modern"".

Although Clinton won the popular vote 65,853,516 (46.1%) to 62,984,825 (48.2%), Trump won the [electoral college](https://www.conservapedia.com/Electoral_college) vote, 306 to 232, with the incomplete vote count reported.[\[297\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-297) Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology testified before Congress that [Google](https://www.conservapedia.com/Google) bias and meddling had shifted ""between 2.6 million and up to 10.4 million votes"" to Hillary Clinton.[\[298\]](https://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#cite_note-298)

My daughter was showing some photographs of me at her age to a friend. I noticed one of them and remembered the dress I had on was handmade by me (Didn’t know how to sew before I did it, didn’t remember how to do it after it was over) and I started reasoning with myself and being less harsh. I have a degree and I do rather technical work. I’ve even taken and passed  a calculus class just because I wanted to see if I could do it since I had to start at basic algebra.

And everyone will use it, and it’s especially bad for younger individuals. Just because it’s illegal for them to have possession of it or use it, doesn’t mean they are just not gonna do it, it’s gonna be bad considering there is gonna be marijuana available everywhere.

""No cis woman has ever had to go through the absurd gauntlet every trans woman is forced to in order to access medical...""  
\-OH, we havent? we dont? HA. Our basic rights are up for debate, abortion bans were recently struck down, but people like YOU think that women and their experiences are triffles, despite it actually being life or death to have access to these services and other resources. You, on the other hand, can get insurance to cover electrolysis so you can feel better about yourself . Meanwhile, ""cis"" women cannot get it covered when they want it, even when its the result of a legit medial condition (like PCOS). Women who WANT their tubes tied or to get a hysterectomy, even just to get an IUD, cant do it without the doctor deciding if they have had enough kids yet, maybe some HYPOTHETICAL man in the future might want her to change her mind, she should consider that made up scenario over the real one she is living, she cant be respected to know her own life. But you can cosmetically alter your body, call it essential, and decide for everyone that its more important, more deserved, more needed than basic fucking healthcare that is still very difficult for most women to access.  


 And its getting more difficult, incidentally, now that trans women ""need"" to take limited spots at gynos to validate their self perception without regard for how pointless and narcissistic that is. And when we DO get access to medical care, for whatever reason, the doctor and nurses are likely to not take our complaints seriously, to assume we are wrong about our own experiences and bodies. Kind of like you are doing now. Its comes from a place of privilege and ignorance about women.  


""If your the only trans gal in the room, you are the only women who can prove it with certified credentials""  


\-lol. We all have birth certificates that show we were born women. Most of us have ID's of some kind. Medical records, ect. Its every cell of our bodies and determines how you are treated on a day to day basis, for better or worse. Your ""certified credentials"" only ""prove"" you  were born a man. Thats WHY you had to get a document. And how typical is that, to try and 'pull rank' with women, because you can get a document. If society collapsed today, I would still be a woman. And everyone would be able to tell that I was a woman. We dont have to prove it, or get a document that says anything about it, because its just material reality. How male to think something so silly as a paperwork makes him anything else than what he is. He thinks it makes him an authority over women, that is the message.

When I was younger, my sister had a friend who had really really cute feet, and always had her toes painted. We were young enough where we could all sleep in the same room and the parents wouldn’t mind (maybe 12-14?), and once they invited me down to watch a movie with them on the couch. Everyone ended up falling asleep except me, and after the movie I noticed her feet were sticking out of the blanket

I had never really seen a girls feet up close before, only by looking at pics and videos online, so I wanted to get closer. I sat at the end of the couch mesmerized by her sole. I gently touched them, and she sort of stirred and stuck her other foot out, and so now both her soles were in my face and I was ecstatic

I spent some time gently touching to see if she’d react but she didn’t, so I began to gently massage them and feel her toes, arch, heels, even her ankles. It was amazing, and they were so soft. I thought about worshipping them but I was really worried about being caught

It took some courage but eventually I decided I was gonna do it. I saw it done in videos and stuff and I wanted to know what it was like. So carefully, I got closer, and gently blew on her sole. No response. I backed up and thought about it a little more, and got closer again, and kissed one of her toes gently. Again nothing. After about 5 min I had kissed those feet everywhere, and I figured she wasn’t gonna wake up, so I gently stuck my tongue out, and slowly ran it up her sole. Still no response

After that, I think I spent at least an hour licking, kissing, and massaging her feet. I was in heaven. I think everywhere from her ankles were covered in saliva. When I’d suck on her toes or run my tongue in between them, she would wiggle them a little bit and I loved it. Ever since that I’ve had a thing for toe wiggling

*They wildin’ out here on this thread!""*

Including saying ""they wildin' out""?  WHAT?

And:

*""Not gonna stoop down to your level for you to understand your level of ignorance.*

*There’s no difference between your mouth and your anus - that’s because shit comes out of both.""*

And the poster got banned, immediately complained about THAT on fragilewhiteredditor and then made another post complaining that five days later r/conservative FINALLY muted them in modmail?

That's just using a subreddit to ridiculously harass a subreddit and its moderators.

But FWR are LEFTISTS...so it's fine.  Back to the AHS comment featured...

Here's what I said here yesterday:

You know ... I think there are more commies than alt righters.

What's behind the alt righters are the same old crusty KKK people that America has always had a remnant of.

The problem now is that while conservatives REPUDIATE those people, the left is embracing their extremists and calling them heroes.

Antifa are a bunch of violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries, but even some politicians champion them.

The left labels the entire RIGHT as extremists and these putrid dweebs show up at generic conservative events to cause havoc. I'm not talking about Charlottesville. I'm talking about these assholes being at the Republican National Convention or the Trump rally in Chicago. THEY DECIDE that someone's a fascist and they show up to bash people, innocents get caught up in it ... and the left swoons and calls them, ""hero!""

And we have ""Democratic Socialist"" politicans now and the next time anyone tells you that it's reasonable and normal, ask them how they would feel if you said ""I'm a Democratic Fascist""? Would that make the end game more palatable?

It's about time for the left to wake up and start policing and punishing their own goddamned violent radicals. MoreTankieChapo should have been banned a long time ago. They regularly call for killing landlords, police, capitalists...OPENLY and reddit ignores it...preferring INSTEAD to play whack a mole with the Nazi communities and even going after The Donald.

Reddits admins are PATHETIC at letting the violent left get away with their bullshit DAILY on this site.

And it's long past time for them to have a come to Jesus moment and realize the role that THEY ARE PLAYING in radicalizing young people on the right by simply not giving a shit about young violent radicals on the left and acting like it's normal and fine for them to use the site and they are WELCOME here because it's a marketplace of ideas. There's no market of ideas saying that police should be killed. And while they punished T_D for that...they literally IGNORE IT EVERYWHERE ELSE.

Because I assume...that the admins think it's just FINE for the left to want to kill cops, maybe because ""they are doing it for the right reasons""? I can't even wrap my head around their utterly dangerous and moronic hypocrisy in what they allow here.

It reinforces this madness. And it gives fuel to anger. When subreddits get away with calling to kill their political opposition if they lean ONE way.... but would be swiftly banned if they leaned the other way, it's absolute bullshit and it's DANGEROUS.

You either decide you aren't going to be a home to violent radicals or you decide you are. Reddit's decided, I guess, that some violent radicals are okay, but others aren't.

Seven years on this site and I've watched this happen and get worse and worse and worse. I wish the admins would just come out and say, ""We are dedicated to the destruction of America's current government and we favor replacing it with a socialist system"" because from here... it sure as hell looks like that's their mission statement.

And while we're at it, let's look at this:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599

&gt;I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

They conspired to drop civics, and CREATE an UNAWARE citizenry ... as long as we were compliant.

Let me tell you, watching young people left and right try to argue and understand politics and government...none of them seem to know WHAT the hell they really stand for. And they don't know what the country was built on and for. They don't know how we have worked to right wrongs. They don't know what it means to be conservative or liberal. They seem to be forming camps on the left and right and there's no middle ground.

It's dangerous, it's deliberate...and reddit has a big hand in it.

"f6sq3xe","You're making the common mistake of attacking an argument I haven't made. Again, I am not referring to racism, but to the concept of race. To say that prior to the Atlantic slave trade human beings were blissfully unaware and ignorant of differences in physical characteristics is completely stupid. It goes back to the beginning of humanity.  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_race_concepts#Early_Modern_period  
  
3rd C. China- Compares ""the barbarians of blond hair and green eyes as 'resembling the monkeys from which they are descended.'""  

~1500 BC India- In the Reg-Vida, the god of the Aryas, Indra, is described as ""blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the black skin which Indra hates."" The Anasahs were dark-skinned with flat noses, and the account describes how Indra ""slew the flat-nosed barbarians,"" and after having conquered their land, Indra decreed that the foe was to be ""flayed of his black sin.""  
  
Egypt- 1350 B.C.- portraits of people on walls of tombs were made in 4 colors, white for people from the North, yellow for people from the East, black for blacks, and red for themselves. When the lighter skinned Egyptians were in power, they referred to the darker group as ""the evil race of Ish."" When the darker group was in power, the lighter skinned people were ""the pale, degraded race of Arvad.""  

Ancient Judaism is full of it. The entire story of Ham being cursed by Noah for not looking away from Noah's nakedness resulted in the descendants of Ham being made dark-skinned.  
  
Ancient Greece has a myth that attempts to account for the different races- the legend of Phaethon, where he lost control of the sun chariot, drove it too close to the Earth, burning people black, and then turning too far away and leaving people cold, turning them white.  
Hippocrates in the 5th century B.C. was assigning characteristics to people of different races based on their color and their physical characteristics.  
4th. Century AD- Julian the Apostate questions ""how very different in their bodies are the Germans and Scythians from the Libyans and Ethiopians."" The Greeks and Romans were very interested in determining how the different ""races"" developed, whether from a single pair of progenitors or multiple, and also how climate and geography might have helped create the different races.  
  
These are not examples of racism per se, as I have never said that racism as such existed prior to the Atlantic slave trade. But these are without a doubt examples of humanity having race constructs well-established prior to the Atlantic slave trade. Europeans did not construct race out of thin air at the time of the Atlantic slave trade to justify it.   
  
Also, if you're now amending your initial comment to only describe ""the modern concepts of race,"" instead of just ""race,"" well then you're just creating a tautology. Yes, modern Europeans did create the modern European concept of race. All of your citations are examples of that.  
  
""Europeans invented the concept of race as we know it."" Well, sure, but they didn't invent the concept of race entirely. That's literally saying, ""European racism that coincides with the Atlantic slave trade comes from the ideas of race that they created at the time of the Atlantic slave trade.""

Yeah, I’ve been out here for almost a decade now and have done a decent amount of street photography as well as painting and it all comes down to how you show yourself. I’ve yet to run into any real issue.

I actually took a class in school that had us doing some photo and recording work in the tenderloin for long periods- My teacher had been doing work in that area for almost 15 years and had only had an issue once during all that time.

He always said it came down to a mixture of respect and blending in. If you’re in someone else’s neighborhood you need to respect them and their space- they’re likely going to know you’re not from that specific neighborhood, but you don’t want to look like some unaware tourist meandering about either. It’s obvious you have relatively expensive photo gear, but if you dress casually and plain, act respectful to the people around you, and do your best to blend in, you just look like a local artist which earns a lot more respect from people than just “unaware techie” or “lost tourist.” 

But yeah- don’t wear anything overly showoffy- keep it simple. Grungy work jeans, a basic hoodie and tshirt and some scuffed up shoes or boots are a safe go to. If you’ve got important gear on you, you don’t want to call attention to yourself. Don’t bring anything you don’t need and use a basic unassuming backpack for your gear.

Be careful where you shoot- a lot of the local drug dealers and prostitutes are actually really friendly people, but absolutely do not take a picture of them working a deal. They have specific spots though, and quickly scoping out an area means you can avoid accidentally taking a picture you shouldn’t because it’ll be pretty obvious. If you’ve got a camera out, just look around- people will spot you and a lot of times you can just tell by their body language whether it’s okay or not.

If you’re new to the area especially I wouldn’t recommend going out of my way to chat with any of the people loitering (since they’re usually dealers, prostitutes or homeless and aren’t looking for random people butting in) but I had a couple of dealers come up and say hi a couple of times. They were bored and were wondering what we were doing. Being quick witted and chatting about your project or the neighborhood and since they’re locals they’ll sometimes have good insight on the area. Yeah, some of people live pretty hard lives and it can be scary I guess, but they’re still normal people. They’ve got interests and hopes and dreams too.

I definitely stress knowing the basics of the neighborhood before you go- especially if you plan on shooting in some of the lower income sections of the city. Like I said, they’ll probably know you’re not from that particular neighborhood, but the city is big with people from all walks of life living there so blending in as a local isn’t too difficult and can be important to a lot of people. I recommend scoping the areas out on google maps before you go- knowing the general area and streets will help, and while it’s cool to check your phone some, staring at google maps directions makes you stick out like a sore thumb.

And just be quick on your feet. If you feel uncomfortable, remove yourself from the situation. Most people are honestly well meaning, but especially in the case of some of the homeless dealing with mental illness and addiction, you want to establish boundaries. I’ve been told I just look friendly and approachable, so I might run into this a little more, but sometimes I’ll chat it up with someone who’s obviously working through some issues and they can be a little clingy/come across as creepy. Generally speaking I think most of them aren’t trying to come across that way or have bad intentions- I think they’re just bored and I’d imagine it’s probably nice to talk to people that are willing to just chat with them and treat them like a normal person.

"f619j3v","Yeah, I’ve been out here for almost a decade now and have done a decent amount of street photography as well as painting and it all comes down to how you show yourself. I’ve yet to run into any real issue.

I actually took a class in school that had us doing some photo and recording work in the tenderloin for long periods- My teacher had been doing work in that area for almost 15 years and had only had an issue once during all that time.

He always said it came down to a mixture of respect and blending in. If you’re in someone else’s neighborhood you need to respect them and their space- they’re likely going to know you’re not from that specific neighborhood, but you don’t want to look like some unaware tourist meandering about either. It’s obvious you have relatively expensive photo gear, but if you dress casually and plain, act respectful to the people around you, and do your best to blend in, you just look like a local artist which earns a lot more respect from people than just “unaware techie” or “lost tourist.” 

But yeah- don’t wear anything overly showoffy- keep it simple. Grungy work jeans, a basic hoodie and tshirt and some scuffed up shoes or boots are a safe go to. If you’ve got important gear on you, you don’t want to call attention to yourself. Don’t bring anything you don’t need and use a basic unassuming backpack for your gear.

Be careful where you shoot- a lot of the local drug dealers and prostitutes are actually really friendly people, but absolutely do not take a picture of them working a deal. They have specific spots though, and quickly scoping out an area means you can avoid accidentally taking a picture you shouldn’t because it’ll be pretty obvious. If you’ve got a camera out, just look around- people will spot you and a lot of times you can just tell by their body language whether it’s okay or not.

If you’re new to the area especially I wouldn’t recommend going out of my way to chat with any of the people loitering (since they’re usually dealers, prostitutes or homeless and aren’t looking for random people butting in) but I had a couple of dealers come up and say hi a couple of times. They were bored and were wondering what we were doing. Being quick witted and chatting about your project or the neighborhood and since they’re locals they’ll sometimes have good insight on the area. Yeah, some of people live pretty hard lives and it can be scary I guess, but they’re still normal people. They’ve got interests and hopes and dreams too.

Consider student-teacher romantic relationships. Here's [policy](http://catalog.yale.edu/dus/university-policy-statements/teacher-student-consensual-relations/) I looked up for Yale University:

&gt; Whenever a teacher is or in the future might reasonably become responsible for teaching, advising, or directly supervising a student, a sexual relationship between them is inappropriate and must be avoided. In addition to creating the potential for coercion, any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process by creating a conflict of interest and may impair the learning environment for other students. Finally, such situations may expose the University and the teacher to liability for violation of laws against sexual harassment and sex discrimination.

&gt; **Therefore, teachers (see below) must avoid sexual relationships with students over whom they have or might reasonably expect to have direct pedagogical or supervisory responsibilities, regardless of whether the relationship is consensual.** Conversely, teachers must not directly supervise any student with whom they have a sexual relationship. Undergraduate students are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship and the potential for coercion, because of their age and relative lack of maturity. Therefore, no teacher shall have a sexual or amorous relationship with any undergraduate student, regardless of whether the teacher currently exercises or expects to have any pedagogical or supervisory responsibilities over that student.

4. As best as you are able, you should keep him as relaxed as possible.  You don't want to alarm him.  It may escalate the situation.

"f3wq5t4","&gt;And Cortana couldn’t do that?

Honestly, post-343i cortana definitely can IMO, and easily. But I don't think old Cortana could do that.

&gt;The only time the effects of MJOLNIR’s stat multiplication was ever stated by a character was by Halsey. Every other instance was from narration/out of universe source. Therefore it’s not a word of character, by definition.

I know that at least one of the other sources was Halsey's journal so that's character too right? I think Halo Encyclopedia also has a mention, but that's cancelled out by its explicit statement of 5x multiplication which we know goes against the feats. Is there anything else I'm missing?

&gt;This is stupid because not every person who wears the suit has the same strength or speed, in fact they make a point to denote noticeable gaps between the strengths and weaknesses of Spartans compared to one another.

No that's my point my good man. If the armor had a fixed amount of power that it could bring to bear via CNS signal control, and that amount is multiple times that of a SPARTAN II, then it would

1) justify, albeit loosely, the term ""force multiplying circuits"". I acknowledge that the interpretation is fairly loose here but I do think it wouldn't be a total misnomer

2) explain why normal humans break themselves even though 5x normal fit human strength isn't enough - their CNS signals are tapping into the suit's SPARTAN level strength which is what's breaking them bones.

&gt;Why not just call it what it allegedly is then if it’s secretly this very straightforward and ununique technology that doesn’t do anything that doesn’t already exist, let alone the main thing it’s marketed as doing?

What would you call such a thing then, while making it sound reasonably not-lame? Fixed-quantity strength-increasing circuits? Circuits that can apply force equal to multiple times that of a SPARTAN II? What would you actually call the thing to reflect the fact that it can bring to bear multiple times the strength of a Spartan? I'm not being facetious. I actually can't think of a good name to call it. Strength-increasing circuit is just too generic and doesn't reflect its capabilities, because we know that spartan 2s could overpower mark 3 mjolnirs, which had normal strength increasing hardware, with their bare hands. The mark 4's raw strength marked a quantum leap from the previous strength increasing hardware and justifies a better name. If you wanted a term that adequately reflected the immense strength of MJOLNIR mark 4, without making it sound stupid, what would you call it? Sincerely, I would call it strength multiplying circuits, which isn't far off from force multiplying circuits.

Anyway, that's my answer to why they don't just call it what it is.

&gt;Before Halsey even had a clue how strong her Spartans were, she said that the armor doubled the wearer’s strength. I guess she’s either trolling or secretly an idiot if somehow she forgot that her Spartans were massively stronger than before, even more than she expected.

Wait what? Mendez had already reported the Spartan IIs' post-augmentation physical strength before she remarked that the armor doubles their strength.

&gt;Then it’s completely unreconcilable either way. I don’t understand how this point is any less relevant to the interpretation that the armor is entirely conceptually based. It just sounds like he made a mistake due to inexperience which is why he pummeled himself.

The thing is though, if he could control the armor's strength with his thoughts (similar to the way he can control its other systems mentally) then it would explain everything. He was at max relaxation, but his thoughts were not - he was ordered to think the armor to move. It would also explain his extreme inexperience. Spartans do not lack fine motor control. It would not be difficult to move his arm with small enough force that 2x or even 5x that amount would not translate to lightning fast movement. A Spartan's full armored arm is, what, a hundred pounds? To move it lightning fast we're talking multiple kilonewtons of force easily. Unless John crushes every glass, fruit, piece of meat, etc that he puts his hands on, he should have no problems exerting less than multiple kilonewtons of force even at 5x multiplication. 200 newtons of force would only translate to 1 kilonewton and there's no way that Chief can't easily hold himself back to below 200 newtons.

&gt;Where does that leave us? You’re just as much arguing against yourself because apparently the sheer concept of moving his arm a little is imperceptibly fast.

Well that would actually make perfect sense if the armor had its own fixed strength controlled by thought. Chief's thoughts were not at maximum relaxation. He wasn't used to controlling the armor either. If he thought a bit too hard it would jerk up with its full strength, which would make it fly up quite fast. It actually makes perfect sense.

&gt;We already know the suit can exert stimuli onto the wearer sufficient to cause involuntary convulsion given Cortana exploded an Infection form that had latched on to Chief by shocking him with electricity.

Cmon man that's QUITE a bit different than hacking a person's nervous system to move him. 

&gt;Try and hold your arm completely still parallel to the ground. You wouldn’t be able to do it if you tried. 

Make a junk e-mail and I'll send you a video. I can't hold it PERFECTLY still but I can limit my movements to low single digit millimeters easily (I actually tried doing it before writing this comment). And I'm well known in my circle of friends to have below-average fine motor control btw - so much so that I struggle to shoot 1 MOA with my friend's thompson and center which he gets half MOA on. Chief honestly shouldn't have any issues with this.

&gt;Humans aren’t machines, we don’t have absolute or perfect control of our bodies and we aren’t infallible. John is being clumsy because he’s going through a heavy handed analogy for puberty, and therefore not used to controlling himself with his “new body”. He made a mistake that wasn’t purposeful.

But the thing is, if the circuits are force multiplying, then there's nothing to learn in terms of relaxing and bringing his arm up. Again, Chief's fully armored arm probably weighs a literal hundred pounds. To move it up that fast requires multiple kilonewtons. Are you saying that normally, Chief can't hold back his strength to below hundreds of newtons? How does he even eat food then lol?

&gt;Says you. It shows how unaware and clumsy he is in this state.

No I'm reading the text right now. She wasn't ordering him.

&gt;You came up with this term to describe a motion I never made.

Came up with what term?

&gt;This is a conclusion you made long before i voiced this opinion when objecting to the notion that a Spartan could warp titanium barehanded. Don’t act as if it’s now unreasonable to hold this view when it’s convenient.

You know what, that's fair.

&gt;Anyway, if not doubled or quintupled or what have you, what is the relationship between Spartan speed and strength with and without their armor according to you? Since “fractal scaling” is just this buzz term Halsey came up with no meaning. Spartans are still accidentally moving at blur speeds and hitting themselves hard enough to pulverize bones by accident.

Here's what I think. There really wasn't any explanation of the exact ""fractal amplification"" mechanism so any technical talk is gonna be conjecture but this is what I think is the most likely given known science and the established feats.

The ""circuits"" and ""crystal layer"" are controlled by CNS signals and can exert their own force according to the strength of the signal received. Why? Because we know from modern science that CNS signals are not just chemical signals, but electrical signals well, and the electrical signal is detectable even without a direct neural interface. We also know that both crystals and circuits can be highly responsive to electricity. If the circuits amplified the neural signals and fed them to the crystals, which then exert the force, all feats, WOG, and WOC are reconciled.

1) It explains why Chief's arm shot up and it it explains why soldiers spasmed their bones to pieces - chief was ordered to think his arm up so he probably thought hard

2) it explains why the soldier destroyed his own body - his CNS signals during the pain spasms were obviously strong, so the full strength of MJOLNIR sprung into action.

3) it explains how the forerunner ai could control the armor. just hack the thing and make it think that the ai's signals are cns signals.

4) It explains the name force-multiplying circuit. Think about it. Unless you're purposely forcing yourself to relax and think thoughts alone, how would you normally send a strong ""MOVE"" CNS signal? By actually moving. The harder you try to move, the stronger the signal. Under normal circumstances, the armor does indeed ""multiply"" your force, because the amount of force that the armor itself is applying is proportional to your CNS signal strength which, in most situations, is in turn proportional to how hard you're flexing your muscles.

5) it fits the known science about crystals and circuits.

Ultimately as much as I think this is the perfect conclusion, it's a conjecture and I'm open to input or criticism.

Anyway man let's stop antagonizing each other. I disagree with a lot of what you say but I respect your knowledge on the topic. Honestly you probably started getting mad at me first because I called your interpretations wank, so I'll apologize for that.

"f3wn1ru","&gt;No? It just has to trick the suit into thinking that the signals the AI are sending are in fact the user's CNS signals, or thoughts if you will

And Cortana couldn’t do that?

The only time the effects of MJOLNIR’s stat multiplication was ever stated by a character was by Halsey. Every other instance was from narration/out of universe source. Therefore it’s not a word of character, by definition.

&gt; Force multiplying circuits could also be interpreted to mean that the circuits increase the user's strength multiple times (or, dare I say it, multiplying it).

This is stupid because not every person who wears the suit has the same strength or speed, in fact they make a point to denote noticeable gaps between the strengths and weaknesses of Spartans compared to one another.

&gt; Of course, as to why it's not simply named ""circuits that increase the user's strength multiple times"", the obvious answer is that force multiplying circuits sounds way better.

Why not just call it what it allegedly is then if it’s secretly this very straightforward and ununique technology that doesn’t do anything that doesn’t already exist, let alone the main thing it’s marketed as doing? There’s no reason to even use the word multiplying any more than any other form of power armor, including the power armor that already exists in universe.

&gt; If max relaxation chief was truly at max relaxation and his arms shot up so fast because the armor's multiplier is insanely high, then chief wouldn't be able to even grip a gun

Then it’s completely unreconcilable either way. I don’t understand how this point is any less relevant to the interpretation that the armor is entirely conceptually based. It just sounds like he made a mistake due to inexperience which is why he pummeled himself.

&gt; The multiplier simply cannot be so high that max relaxation causes superspeed motion, it would make Chief completely unable to function. Therefore we know for certain that this interpretation is wrong.

Where does that leave us? You’re just as much arguing against yourself because apparently the sheer concept of moving his arm a little is imperceptibly fast. 

&gt; Nothing suggests that intrepid eye can hack a biological being's nervous system to control his muscles except your interpretation

We already know the suit can exert stimuli onto the wearer sufficient to cause involuntary convulsion given Cortana exploded an Infection form that had latched on to Chief by shocking him with electricity. 

&gt; The fact remains that chief had absolutely 0 reason to disobey halsey's request in this situation. It's a fairly minimal request - just relax and test the system. Disobeying such a small order for no good reason is just plain insubordination.

Try and hold your arm completely still parallel to the ground. You wouldn’t be able to do it if you tried. Humans aren’t machines, we don’t have absolute or perfect control of our bodies and we aren’t infallible. John is being clumsy because he’s going through a heavy handed analogy for puberty, and therefore not used to controlling himself with his “new body”. He made a mistake that wasn’t purposeful.

&gt; Yea I misremembered and Chief has some instances of disobeying orders

My point is that you have a tendency to overrate your memory and I am forced to repeatedly do all of the research and work on your behalf since you can’t be bothered. This hurts every argument you make however valid the reasoning may be.

&gt; That is not an order. You're stretching it way too far.

Says you. It shows how unaware and clumsy he is in this state.

&gt; You're the one pretending

You came up with this term to describe a motion I never made.

&gt; Let's summarize the assumptions of your interpretation, as you yourself have stated.
1) Nylund has no concept of scale

This is a conclusion you made long before i voiced this opinion when objecting to the notion that a Spartan could warp titanium barehanded. Don’t act as if it’s now unreasonable to hold this view when it’s convenient.

&gt; therefore all references of 2x or even 5x force multiplication are wrong

In this instance, maybe. In others, it would seem more consistent. I think it’s a stupid idea to rely on a specific number anyway. The only reason I’d ever even reference it is the fact that either the armor’s strength enhancement is framed as improving drastically over time (which would coincide with the influx of higher end feats in media taking place post-2552) as indicated by Halsey’s Journal, or it’s been retconned to be massively higher than the doubled strength Nylund initially envisioned.

Anyway, if not doubled or quintupled or what have you, what is the relationship between Spartan speed and strength with and without their armor according to you? Since “fractal scaling” is just this buzz term Halsey came up with no meaning. Spartans are still accidentally moving at blur speeds and hitting themselves hard enough to pulverize bones by accident.

&gt; Intrepid eye straight up hacked Fred's nerves and could move his body

That’s more believable when you consider that AI straight up can’t manipulate the armor in any way otherwise. Bad Blood agrees.",1571209909,"it shows how unaware and clumsy he is in this state.  &gt; you're the one pretending  you came up with this term to describe a motion i never made.  &gt; let's summarize the assumptions of your interpretation, as you yourself have stated.","unaware and clumsy","unaware","and",FALSE,"how unaware and clumsy","clumsy","how",NA,1
"f3vvi5p","I actually have a concept organization that Im passionate about that aims to do just this. Its called ""**Targeted.**""

It would provide resources, education and referral networks to victims. Resources such as advocacy, support hotlines and safe shelters. (The shelter part could be accomplished by working with homeless shelters and partnering up with them to ensure they're truly safe places.) Education that provides reactive and preventative protective methods to protect yourself and your family from being/becoming targeted. And lastly referral services such as legal assistance, mental health support and local resource centers.

However it could face alot of hurdles. It can become a very delicate endeavor to actually ""help"" victims. First of all, I imagine if a *physical assistance center* was offered that the person who asks for help and has assassins following behind them could pose a challenge. But working with local law enforcement to ensure they're capable of responding and ensuring an office / charter is safeguarded enough to ensure a hostage situation doesn't sprout could resolve that. 

If those at home are targeting a person, providing housing and shelter programs can become expensive and easily abused.

And getting funding is a big problem. Some more elaborate goals can become very expensive. Not to forget that getting funding from certain elite groups that are trying to cover up the nearly dead hooker they paid for rather then save her/him could pose a challenge. *humor* However the reality is, is that the world isnt completely like that.

I already run one organization however it was initially built primarily to educate the unaware and uninvolved about gangstalking rather than assist victims directly. Targeted is an organization that provides direct assistance to victims. I may start off with a smaller sized call center and grow from there.

"f37ze2d","We may very well exist in a universe that was created by an entirely alien ""external civilization"", that may very well be completely unaware and unconcerned about sentient life in this universe. Maybe its one of many universes simulated to figure out the difference in nature of matter based on differences in laws of nature. Or maybe the point of interest is the nature of celestial formations based on different physical constants (such as the gravitational constant). None of these types of simulations would necessitate that either it is possible to even discern the virtual nature of the universe, or that the external entities are in the least bit concerned about living constituent of our universe, or that interaction with the external universe is possible.  

In such scenarios there is no reason particularly as to why we shouldn't make one of our own before trying to ""get out"", if the nature of our universe is such that getting out is an impossibility.

"f1ypwqq","Wow,

I think that Sandman1025 pretty said what I was going to say.

I feel/think that you really should think about your relationship, and ask yourself if you are happy now, and do/can you see yourself being happy in the near and far future while in this relationship.

I see red flags in pretty much everything you have written, and to put things in simple terms, things don't look good my man.

I don't think you are being ""too sensitive"", in fact that statement really sounds like gas lighting to me.

There was no mention of how long you dated and how long the engagement was, and if there was any cohabitation.   I'm gonna guess the answers are, ""not long"", ""pretty short"" and ""no"".

I will also guess that she pushed/pressed to make things happen quickly, and she was really private/secretive about her finances, as well as any talk about any exes.  

I'm sorry to say that it really looks like she decided that you were a ""good catch"" and she totally played you, by being or representing herself as someone she wasn't.  And of course the ""true colors"" came out, pretty much as soon as you put the ring on her finger and signed the paperwork...

I personally think that you should look into ending this relationship as soon as possible, not sure where you are, and what options you have, but annulment would be best/ideal (like you never got married in the first place) the reason(s) are pretty much spelled out in your OP.  And if that isn't an option, then a divorce.  In either case, be prepared for her and possibly her family to get really nasty...

I'm really sorry that I had to say all that, but that's how I see things based on what you have written.  It really looks like the two of you are/were incompatible, but you were unaware and unable to see it because she hid things and ""pretended"" to be someone that she isn't.

I would suggest that you go back to the or a lawyer and ask about annulments, I would expect a lawyer to ask you what you want to do, and then advise you based on your wants/wishes.  I really think that you should get a second opinion, and specifically ask about annulments.  I personally don't care for lawyers, especially divorce lawyers, because they benefit the most when you have a really messy and long divorce.  That being said, doesn't mean that all lawyers are bad, but it never hurts to be careful.  Also, using the Google and the like to get information on divorce and annulment in your country/area is always a good idea.

Only four months, and this level of unhappiness, that really sucks.

I do hope that you are able to find/make a plan that works best for you, you should do the things that make you happy or that you know are good for you.  No real or logical reason to stay in such a new relationship.

BTW, I would highly suggest/recommend that you don't have unprotected sex with her, and don't trust that she is taking precautions.  Getting pregnant is often a ploy used by some women to try to tie the man down and keep him from leaving.  

Finally, be really cautious when/if she suddenly becomes ""better"" because that's a TRAP!  She will just go back to her old/real ways as soon as she feels that the ""danger"" has passed.

Best wishes and good hope to you.

Stay strong, you deserve to be happy/content with your relationship.",1569821734,"it really looks like the two of you are/were incompatible, but you were unaware and unable to see it because she hid things and ""pretended"" to be someone that she isn't.","unaware and unable","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unable","unable",NA,NA,1
"f1wz0id","I kinda just think Gems and Leo’s are a natural attraction at first but it ends up being toxic in my experience. I think Leo’s have very high expectations that can be unrealistic  and Gems are just known to be flaky and flighty. Tip: Leo’s like to be appreciated (they can’t help it they’re just egocentric like that), and maybe your friends perspective is they’re not getting back what they put in. I obviously don’t know your dynamics just trying to help preserve the friendship. I just know in my experiences I’ve had a lot of Gem friends who’ve been very unaware and opportunistic. Something that drives a generous Leo who wants recognition for their warmth. I also know typically Gem and Leo personalities can clash because Gems can drive Leo’s crazy with how much they talk about themselves! (Not fair since it’s a Leo but hey they probably want a little more of the spotlight because they’re often the most extra friend). Also, Leo’s are known for their sensitivity and I think Gems are often very not self  aware or in tune of the emotions and people around them (just in my experience). They’re just flighty and fun people. Meaning there’s a lot of room to hurt someone and not realize it.

No, we all understand how copays and premiums and health insurance (and budgets and yardwork and mortgages/rent and driving and kid activities and cooking ...) work. And what she wrote doesn't add up, even if she doesn't give us the '2.' Any of those individual fancy extras (plane tickets, dresses, hotels, concert tickets) would cover even a high copay.

Do not become a predictable Aramusha player. There are a select amount of tools at the Aramusha’s disposal, however they are all pretty readable. Aramusha is meant for a high damage/risk type of play style. Few other characters have the ability to confirm as much damage as he can. But that’s the trade off...he’s easily read and predicted. Your best friend, therefor, is feinting. Baiting attacks and counter attacking will be your game, if you truly decide to get good with the Mush.

- Most players who aren’t able or aware how to exploit Aramusha’s chain will also go for parries on his heavy chain attacks. Use this to your advantage. Feinting these Heavies into the side lights is a good way to chip away at a defense-happy enemy. Feinting these Heavies for your full-block counters is a good way to combat parry-happy enemies.

- Aramusha excels at removing the unaware and incapable. Single out enemies who seem busy at other tasks (I.e. clearing mid, back capping zones...)

[Read this.](https://bpdfamily.com/content/how-borderline-relationship-evolves) If you resonate with the article treat is as the final proof that you need to confirm to yourself that he has BPD.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to help someone who refuses help. Most pwBPDs are both unaware and unwilling to recognize they have a personality disorder. Multiple factors play in this - for a pwBPD, a BPD diagnosis is interpreted through splitting and an inner belief that they are unlovable to the core and such diagnosis would verify to them that there is something wrong at them They have narcissistic ego defence mechanisms at play where they deny and project when faced with their own shame. Stigma of the disorder (which is quite frankly, self-created by pwBPDs to an extent) keeps them out from seeking help. When they do seek help, they have the tendency to drop out of the therapy. For them to have any level of success in therapy they have to spend years at there and if they are in a relationship while they are at it... they sabotage their own recovery since the intimacy of the relationship will affect their mental state negatively (it's what will trigger the fights in the first place). 

So given the above circumistances with the fact that these type of relationships tend to cause PTSD/CPTSD to their partners... it's really not worthwhile to stick it out.

"exox7ns","POV Characters? Well I'd have to say that I personally find that obviously Daenerys and Tyrion are our most intelligent POV characters by a landslide. They practically beat us over the head with how gifted these two are at almost everything they do. Granted they have set up a catastrophe and obstacle after obstacle for Daenerys to run her way through whereas Tyrion has had a much more simple time in KL though it seems like he's bored out of his mind through most of it showcasing that even though the situation there isn't desirable and may be less strenuous, he could probably handle it in his sleep more often than not. They both have major downfalls though. Daenerys has to struggle with the side of her that yearns to just be a little girl that has a loving family and a home to return to, the part of her that just says fuck it, burn it all out of existence so that I can just do what I want. And the part of her that feels she needs to be a mother. A grown woman protecting what she deems her family, her children. Tyrion has issues with his pride though. We see that the only real times he slips up are when Cersei is just to chaotic for him to figure out, or when she teams up with their father. And obviously Tywin is smarter than both. But these things usually wouldn't change his standing as Tyrion has the ability to put things on hold. He's shown to know when to play with others when it's necessary but sometimes when it comes to these two it becomes apparent that it changes into a battle of pride and he feels as though he needs to defend it by battling with them on their terms where he is at a significant disadvantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of that being said I think the middle of the road in terms of POV have to be Catelyn, Cersei and Sansa. Catelyn and Cersei both had the potential to be with Daenerys and Tyrion. They are so incredibly smart that they think along the same wavelength as the two above in several occasions but usually tend to forego what their brains tell them to do in favor of what their hearts tell them to. And that is stupid. I can't argue that they both don't have incredibly stupid moments, because they really do. But at times it just feels like they both are way ahead of the people around them and at others it feels as though they are dead last. So middle of the road for them. And Sansa is here because... she's Sansa. She started off painfully unaware and just awful and it's obvious where she'd being led to. She will become the next Cersei and Catelyn esque character.

Fronklin would never forget the phrase “He stole my balls!” Those were the words that escaped the lips of the old Bessie the moment her Alzheimer’s made her forget who he was. She used to give him two balls of yarn a week, free of charge, because of their long-standing friendship. It was her mental illness that would ultimately put him in prison and end his project of creating the world’s largest crocheted scarf. On that fateful day, when he grabbed the usual two balls off the shelf, she no longer remembered their agreement. And that’s when he heard it.

!!!WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO!!!

“What happened ma’am?!”

*”HE STOLE MY BAAAALLS!!!”*

*Clink* His sixteen year sentence had begun.

Time passed, and Fronklin got horny. Without open internet access, nor a steady income, he could not afford to see the beauty of a woman’s form any longer. He wasted all of his money on erotic magazines that grew old. Their pages yellowed, and his sex life, nay his penis, shriveled. On top of this, he no longer had money for twinkies and coffee, and this caused a bout of depression to settle in. 

He needed something different.

As if by the hand of the gods, Fronklin non-consentually met a man in the shower the week after his funds ran out. The Reddit mods are waving the PG-13 flag at me, so we can just assume the rest of what happened.

He hated what Hank did to him in that shower... or so he thought. As the years passed, Fronklin realized that this was the best he could do, and he started accepting it. Hank ate his ass, every day and every night. He couldn’t help the bulging pleasure in his eyes when Hank did his thang. This was the real life, this wasn’t just fantasy.

Fast forward to the end of his sixteen-year yarn sentence, he finds it in his heart to thank the old Bessie for his prison sentence. Without her false accusations, he would have never discovered that he was an ass-eating connoisseur. He walked into that same shop where it all started, simply to say thank you.

She had died. 

He was heartbroken, but found comfort in the fact that the agreement he used to have with Bessie lived on. Because of her, he received two balls - Hank’s balls - every. single. day. It was as though she had been telling him he were gay the entire time, and only now did he understand it.

Fronklin and Hank are happy. They are socially unaware and flamboyant homosexuals who eat each other’s asses, even at the most inappropriate times.

If there is one thing video game development, VFX, and tech companies can teach us, as well as the fact that CEO pay has skyrocketed while worker compensation has stagnated (And not even caught up to inflation)... it's that we **need** unions. 

I mean sure unions take money in dues... but guess where that money goes: getting you vision, dental, health coverage, job security, continuing training, and more. And doing the math, it's often cheaper than if you just kept the money from union dues and went to buy that stuff on your own. (Lol, jobs in tech don't give you things like *dental* or *vision*.)

"ew234ly","Yeah I'm definitely a Rupert fan. He's a great character whenever there's a theme for him to work with because he makes that theme into his entire soul in game. Obviously he's not a good player but I think expecting him to be some great player is a fool's errand.

In PI obviously he's amazing and one of the best and most iconic characters ever. A truly excellent hero and flawed in the perfect way where in retrospect you understand exactly *why* he loses and it's really awesome. Putting him up against arguably the best villain ever is another huge plus. The vast majority agree he's amazing here.

In All-Stars I don't particularly like him although your mileage my vary on that. There are some good moments like his terrible shelter on Saboga but for the most part he's kinda just ""that likable guy from last season"" since he doesn't really have a theme to latch onto here, along with some pretty bad comments thrown in about people like Sue.

I love him in HvV but definitely think people are split on this version of him as well. He's great to me because he's so clearly invested in this hero theme and he so badly wants to represent these hero ideals and that all goes to his head and while he is technically the hero with his underdog status and opposing Russell, he is so clearly also just a completely unaware and sometimes arrogant person who refuses to acknowledges his mistakes. Again, a very good flawed hero in my eyes.

It's kinda tough to say in BvW since he's first out but I think he's still pretty good for what he is. Again, going as hard as he can with the theme and sacrificing himself for Laura, then just completely ignoring Candice on RI so he can win, and then bulldozing through a challenge and going on to lose anyway is pretty funny. Though he's not around for long so I can see why people wouldn't like him here.

Overall I think Rupert is great whenever he has some kind of tangible theme that he latch himself to, he really sells those ideas of the theme so well and he's so committed to it and the game of Survivor (or at least the game in his own view of it) that's it great to watch in my opinion.",1565037172,"he's great to me because he's so clearly invested in this hero theme and he so badly wants to represent these hero ideals and that all goes to his head and while he is technically the hero with his underdog status and opposing russell, he is so clearly also just a completely unaware and sometimes arrogant person who refuses to acknowledges his mistakes.","unaware and sometimes","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and sometimes arrogant","arrogant","completely","sometimes",1
"ew1lxrs","The hardest to start with is Arch due to the manual install (not that hard but can be daunting for a beginner), but everything you will ever want or need is available in the Arch User Repository (AUR). Arch is a rolling distro meaning it gets updated constantly, but it always been extremely stable for me. I have heard horror stories about failed updates and messed up installs. ***Can say, ""I use Arch btw"" but nobody really gives a shit.*** (I use Arch, btw... and KDE Neon)

Manjaro is good, based on Arch, has an installer, many choices for Desktop Environments (Plasma, XFCE, Gnome, Budgie, etc) and Window Managers (i3, BSPWM, Awesome), I believe they have access to the AUR (any Manjaro users please chime in here), good community. I've never used it but have heard both good and bad stories about it. ***Will be hated by actual Arch forum users, I'm kidding, well not really...***

KDE Neon is good, based on Ubuntu LTS, Minimal Plasma Desktop only, easy installer, Ubuntu forums are very helpful. The KDE Plamsa desktop and select programs are rolling, while the Ubuntu base is not. I've also heard stories about it being a ""franken-distro"" but my install is so stable it's almost boring. (I like to tweak things)

As for a DEs, Plasma and XFCE seem to be the easiest to start with due to their flexibility. They are the two I use, Arch XFCE and KDE Neon Plasma, so I'm probably a little bias. They have flexible panels, widgets and settings to tweak. Gnome, Budgie, and others not so much. Extensions can help but get broken from time to time. WMs like i3, well they open a whole world of possibilities but you will probably be editing config files by hand. 

My advice? Grab Manjaro, pick your favorite DE or WM and use it as a live cd. Look at their config files and start messing with them and see what happens. If you break something, reboot, and try again. You do something you really like write it down or take a screen shot with your phone of your changes. My phone used to be full of config screen shots. Search Unixporn using your DE or WM as a filter and look at what others have done.

"evf85v0","AND crucially in the eyes of the law, seeking to gain from that pretence. And this is the ONLY place the tribunal can go. Either they say the Code says actual females don't exist OR they say Yaniv is taking the piss. Either way, they can't fudge this. It's not as though JY presented as a man and then said I'm a trans man to people who actually offer male genital waxing. He presented as a man but said he was a woman, or presented as a woman then said he had male genitalia. NONE of which is discrimination on the part of people who only offer services of female genital waxing.  


I think the reason it was accepted was the volume of complaints, they thought maybe minorities discriminating against each other was happening, and, it was an opportunity to clarify whose rights are prioritised if both sides are minorities. There may or may not be an element of personal hobby horse for Tribunal Members (whoever chooses cases to go ahead and allocate them isn't Costineau) who wanted to show how this 'new' Code about Trans works perfectly well in practice.  


What they got was a determined man seeking to twist both natural language and the law to justify a racist powertrip. Who has in the process derailed TRA ideology by using it for his own ends. And who has already been given the benefit of the doubt with the publication ban, on racism and a variety of other issues like vexatious litigant. ALL of which the Member has reserved the right to say, ok it's been raised, we aren't there yet, let's see after the Hearings. Which may have felt supportive of Trans activist agendas at the time, to protect this new law from being trashed on rumour alone, but has backfired bigtime and embarrassed the entire nation for being so accomodating and not saying ok, in any other circs what you've raised would be enough, let's act now.  


There's no way the Tribunal is going to be able to say anything other than -   
1. is gender ID an issue? Yes the law says JY is entitled not to be misgendered, but the Respondants were confused and unaware and anyway JY has been so racist and behaved improperly there's no costs.

2. What services do these women offer - genital waxing ONLY to biological females. Thereby making clear by implication if not explicitly that the natural use of the word woman excludes all males, and that including males in it, is not in general use or understanding in that particular segment of the community (immigrant women with a different culture and language). But the Tribunal can't say that changing the natural use of a word is a good or bad thing. That'll be at a higher court another time. So they don't offer what JY wants if it was genital waxing. Not sure how they'll jump if it's arms or faces - but if they don't do any biological male at all, they should be ok. If they do biological males and refused JY then I imagine it was discrimination but his confusing and improper behaviour means the remedy is NIL costs to pay to JY.

3. In denying service was it because of gender ID? No. Because gender ID is irrelevant if they don't offer the service to biological males. AND they had no idea men can call themselves women.  Again could be Yes if they offer to biological males but refused to JY because he said he was a girl which he's entitled to in law, but again NO costs which is the remedy cos of JY's bad behaviour.  


4. What is the remedy for anything that has found to be discriminatory? Costs. To be reduced or imposed punitively for the bad behaviour on the relevant side. JY won't get any money because of the sheer volume of times the Member has had to repeatedly tell JY over and over to behave themselves. Question is, will damages cover actual costs for time and emotional burden for the Repsondants. If Member issued £15K punitive costs for Whatcott in Oger v Whatcott for his behaviour, I think JY is looking at quite a large sum to be held against them.",1564490864,"yes the law says jy is entitled not to be misgendered, but the respondants were confused and unaware and anyway jy has been so racist and behaved improperly there's no costs.","confused and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"confused and unaware","confused",NA,NA,0

I was desperate to have that tag of ‘animal lover’ to be something that truly described me, so I went and did some research and realised that I had been a hypocrite. It didn’t take me more than 5 minutes of research to come to that conclusion.

The advice. Walk away. is very wise.

I'd add; run! now. while you still have time. 

The advice; let daughter have contact when shes grown up. Is good advice. Wait till she's not vulnerable and is aware. (Of NPD/ASPD)

0-8yrs old is crucial development. Its worth reading up on secure attachment theory before MIL destroys it.

I've been where you are now. And my biggest regret is waiting till 3 years to walk away from my MUM and my wifes MIL from hell. And my Dad. Not as big an asshole as my mum. but on the asshole spectrum. 

Your MIL is fake nice. Has an evil and  nice side. No empathy. BEWARE.

Read up on narcissists. (look up NPD and ASPD. Key points are; ""insecure"", ""manipulative"" and ""no empathy"")

If you find a tick list your MIL will be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick..........

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why people like you and me make mistakes with narcissists and sociopaths (aka assholes );

We assume others are nice like us.

We 'project' our caring qualities onto others and thats what we see. (Sometimes they do behave kindly/nicely).

'We don't see things as they are. We see things as we are.'

&amp;#x200B;

The key to thriving is being aware. At the moment you are not aware. You are asleep. You are blind. 

Love is blind. 

There are benefits to ignoring reality. It's an easier option. Feels nicer.

The brutal facts of reality are tough. 

Irvin D. *Yalom* — 'Every person must choose how *much truth* he can stand.'

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my mum's evil behaviour (towards my 4 year old niece) at our wedding , It took me over 3 years later after she was worse, then I cut her from my life. My mistake.  Biggest regret. I didn't expect my mum be so nasty. My son was 3 and took weeks to recover from the stress of her last visit but her evil behaviour and comments she had made to him publicly and privately would damage him forever. I knew my mum was NPD/fake nice/asshole months before my wedding. I under estimated her for 3 years. If you haven't realised your MIL is NPD/ASPD you have a lot to learn and years of pain/regrets ahead of you.

The psychological damage towards my 3 year old son cant be undone and repaired. I tried. We tried. Everything. More than 3 experts. Children's Hospital expert Doctor. Psychiatrist. MH specialist Social Worker. GP. He's 8 now. Happy but insecure kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my errors and yours;

under estimated NPD/ASPD/fake nice/assholes

over estimated my own knowledge of NPD/ASPD/fake nice/assholes

over estimated my/our ability as majority adults in sons life to keep him happy and secure

wanted my son to have grandparents 

wanted my son to have big family 

wanted my son to be surrounded by lots of people that care about him

wanted time/sleep while son had time with others/sleepover 

not ready to face reality 

didnt read/get any advice warning me of potential dangers (like you are getting from me and others today)

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't even realise till Domestic Violence got high profile that what we went through was DV.

After cutting mum out for last time and dad, they spinned their (mostly fake) story and family/friends bought it (and didnt ask for our side) and we got cut from about 50 people.

That was hard. We realised almost all family/friends were NPD/fake nice/assholes too. But we lost some 'close good people' too. (Even nice people are mostly unaware and blind to NPD, so can be manipulated and can only see (fake) nice behaviour)

The brutal facts of reality are tough. I wasn't ready to see it but the signs were there for most people, years before.

The event above was a good friendship test, to find out everyone that was NPD and who loved me unconditionally (almost no one. Tough! No wonder I didn't face up to that years before)

Better off without them in long run. In short run. Lonely, tough. Depressing.

It's still a tough grieving process. Grieving the parents I wish I had. And family/friends. Its like a death. Of almost everyone you know.

The above life experience is like doing personality training AND then assessing everyone you know AND then accepting the assessment AND then acting to surround yourself/family with only caring loving people. The toughest personal development course ever. 

Irvin D. *Yalom* — 'Every person must choose how *much truth* he can stand.'

Admiral Stockdale ""You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be""

Adversity can be beneficial -in the long run. Silver lining. And there are dangers of being too positive. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_Stockdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stockdale)

Everyone is a pawn. NPD are playing chess. You are being played. Run! Grieve. Recover. Trust me. The short term pain is less than the long term pain and consequences. The acts and comments that MIL will make in future will be BIGGER than 'first haircut'. Beware. You cannot 'win' or influence or control their game/an asshole. You can only run away or keep them away. (PS there is no 'cure. And they will never change. Ever. Accept it)

Dr Malcom Kendrick- “The simple fact is that we humans are social animals. We require nurture and support by others. We need a sense of belonging, a sense of value and purpose. We need to be loved, not hit, or shouted at, or bullied, or treated with contempt.”

Even if you only have supervised access. There are down sides. My mum would be nasty even when I was in the same room, and I usually didn't see her at times subtle behaviour. And who wants to be around people that don't want the best for us?! 

That's a dangerous game being around these people. Risks your health, happiness, sanity and success. And that of your kids.

My plan is to wait till my kids are wise enough and old enough to look after themselves and can tell her to fuck off, like I did, if they want. I will teach them about 2 types of people. Nice people and assholes. The asshole spectrum. And fake nice people etc. And tell them to thrive I recommend having a 'no asshole' rule in life/work/friends/family/community.

They will make their own decisions and mistakes when they are ""responsible to take the wheel of their life"" (JK Rowling Harvard Speech)

I am the responsible adult right now. And I let my child down. Not sure if I will forgive myself for that. May you learn from my mistakes and your own. And avoid the pain from both. Thereby enjoying less pain and more joy in your life. 

HIH

I'm glad you mentioned that. I have observed this multiple times myself and in the past, and it was something I never understood.  But now, knowing what I know, it makes sense.  I remember a dude in high school that was tall, skinny and very average face but he had to be on the spectrum.  He had a very stoic, stiff demeanor with almost no charm or sociability. He even had a weird way of shifting his eyes that was very android like lol.  But  he was very quick with comebacks and delivered them in a dry and emotionless way. He did it in a way that made him come across as an arrogant dick who gave no shits.  But it was really just his particular Aspie cocktail that his brain formed.  Needless to say he had a quite a few girls trying to get with him. And he didn't understand when women would flirt with him.  He would practically shoo them away because it made him uncomfortable.  But the key was that he was so stiff that his discomfort wasn't visible. We were all bewildered as it made no sense since he was always just ""that guy in class"".

"etaf1ng","I wouldn't full-bore take over cooking quite yet - that's asking a lot of yourself and more importantly the rest of the family. 

But - do obviously consider taking over some.  maybe pick a night like and make it a bit of a ritual thing.  then that opens the door for future growth.  and it gives you the rest of the week to practice your own foods so you don't have to subject your family to every hurdle of your learning curve.

So some obviously basic tips? 

* more green things.   try accompanying meals with a small side bowl of salad, or make a good salad into the meal.  My wife and i will even do ""steak salads"" and ""chicken salads"" as a way to get meat on a mostly-green plate.
*90% of weight management is about calories in/ calories out.  so one of the things we did was to start using smaller plates/bowls.  not the big dinner plate, because the natural tendency is to fill it.   
* another big thing we do is we ask how hungry we are, on a scale of 1-15 before we plate up the dish.  rarely do we say even 9 or higher.  it helps put people into a mode where they're gauging that and thinking about intake.  you can have an 11 day, and you'll get a double scoop, but... but you are more aware of what you're doing.  you can obviously use whatever scale you want, 1-10 is fine.
* if you want to get good at cooking a dish, i highly recommend cooking that dish using a vast array of recipes.   Recipes are the real deal for learnign how to cook well.  some will be a bust, some will be great once out of the 3 times you try it.  but say you want to learn how to cook a home-cooked tomato sauce for pasta, you just practice that, over and over.   say you want to learn how to cook Kung Pao Chicken or Pad Thai, or turtle soup, you have to just commit to doing it many times.  then you'll get the hang of it enough to ""wing it"".

So my very first job ever was when I was 16 was at Denny's. I was a hostess, seating people at tables, getting drinks, and answering the phone.  This Denny's was in Utah during the 90's and so it was the only game in town past 7pm.  

So we were always, always, hopping. People would call the restaurant asking about wait times because we had lines out the door on the weekends, and this was before cellphones, so people would call in and ask to page friends or family. And I was really clueless, socially unaware and incredible naive. 

So it's Friday night, and we are slammed. Line out the door,  phone ringing nonstop. I pick up the phone and it's for a page. ""Hi, this is Carl. Carl Mioff. I'm looking for my brother, Jack. Jack Mioff. Could you please page him""

"es817ip","Those were some fantastic links, and the mini-series the news did was really interesting, though I have to say I think it was biased. The Mom seemed demonized, mostly because it looks like she left her prior two kids with her ex-husband. 

I used to live in Good 'Ol IF (Idaho Falls) and I immediately wondered if her ex husband was with the LDS church. At least when I was there, LDS members had tremendous sway over court proceedings, and the courts were usually keen to leave the kids with the LDS parent in the case of a divorce. Being unemployed at the time of her divorce, she may have given away custody because it was her only option and she didn't have any money to fight it. I just don't feel like she should be judged on this. I don't see what value this information is, not really. The argument comes across as ""you had your aggressive dog put down 5 years ago, so you probably killed your missing puppy."" Doesn't really feel like anything other than a knee-jerk to me.

In demonizing Mom, I don't think they looked nearly close enough at the Grandfather. In an interview about his Great-Grandson going missing, possibly abducted or killed by an animal, this guy is laughing and making weird, tone-deaf jokes, that come across as a vaguely incriminating. They also don't look at law enforcement. I'm sad to say this, but as well meaning as the sheriff seems, he doesn't seem capable of an investigation this size and scope. I suspect there's evidence that's long gone, but could have told us something more complete. I think they did a meh job at the initial investigation.

My hot take is this: I think that Issac was invited along to keep the grandfather company on the camping trip. Since he's on oxygen, he can't go far, he probably needs someone to sit with and chat. I think when the kid goes missing, everyone thinks ""oh shit"", realizes how odd it is to take a non-close family friend on an otherwise all family camping trip and tries to come up with some reason that doesn't sound like ""we wanted to pawn Gramps off on someone else for a few hours."" I also think they pointed fingers at him because he was an easy target. The grandfather, in particular, seems keen to throw his friend under the bus, and even claims he doesn't trust the man, nor does he know why he invited him on the trip, or is even friends with him. He drops Issac like a hot potato as the investigation heats up.

Let's focus on Issac for a second. Issac seems both slow-witted and down on his luck to me. This is not a smart man.  Again, an easy target. But does he know anything? I think that the cops would have easily gotten information out of him, had they tried. Same with the PIs. Because of that, I struggle to feel that he had anything to do with it. He's not even a worthwhile alibi, saying he really doesn't remember anything or know anything, to the point he certainly can't exonerate anyone.

So, that leaves Vern and Bob (the grandfather.) I don't think Vern is involved. I think the Mom would have figured that out, and given the intense focus on her, told the cops as soon as possible. Bob? Bob strikes me as having a very, very good idea of what happened. If he didn't instigate it, I somewhat suspect he ""let"" it happen. I think the reason he's no longer friends with Issac is because he wanted Issac to be an alibi, and then realized the man was too unaware and too simple-minded to provide one.

Personally, I'd like to know a LOT more about Bob Walton, and his past.",1561685410,"i think the reason he's no longer friends with issac is because he wanted issac to be an alibi, and then realized the man was too unaware and too simple-minded to provide one.","unaware and too","unaware","and",FALSE,"too unaware and too simple","simple","too","too",1

Is it possible that you’re putting too much weight in imaginary internet points because these are the only things you have? Can you actually present any complaint or case in court that would take note of magical downvotes?

The reality is that the Kickstarter project was started many years ago. Steam was never advertised in those years. What was noted was that backers’ funds will be used to develop Shenmue 3. A Steam version was eventually noted years later, well after the funding project had closed.

Ergo, it’s an open and shut case:

- Were backer funds used to develop the game? Yes.
- Will the game release on PC? Yes.
- Will the game release on Steam eventually? Yes.

You can be upset every possible way, and you can be angry 24/7 if that’s what gives your internet life any meaning. But, the point still stands that you’re arguing within the bounds of the law and reality.

People paid for a game to be developed and to eventually come to PC. If a company can meet those demands, there is no legal action that can be put forward. Legally, they’re in the clear. PR-wise, it’s still a mess.

In fact, my suggestion for you right now is to ask around in r/legaladvice or any subreddit, forum, or website dedicated to consumer law. Let’s see how far your outrage takes you before a reality check hits.

Yes, and it's awful. I agree. Though I wouldn't dare say everyone or even both parties are equally to blame.
Let's be clear: **one party is for affordable education** and the other is simply not. The only education agenda for the Republican party is privatization and introducing Christian indoctrination into public education. 

They are not equal, not by a long shot. 
**But yes, absolutely I agree, the political and media class over the last 50 years has produced an ineffective citizen mass**, especially in terms of electing honest leaders, designing economic revolution, advocation of human rights, pursuing equality and ridding the world of war.

No, it still is. You're misinterpreting this. Ivey does not want an unaware citizen class, literally read anything he's written. Again, he's lamenting the lack of policy driven voting, HE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

If he did, his candidate would have won by a fucking landslide. Right? You could agree on that? 

&gt;Sure, it's possible for one to screw up a sentence when writing e-mails and write something you did not intend to, but what we have here is three coherent sentences that match all too well. At the absolute least you cannot deny that he perceives the US citizenry as unaware and that he finds it a good thing as long as they vote for the right candidates (hence the prior consideration of Clinton being an 'entertainer' herself).

I won't state the same argument over. I'll let Bill Ivey do it:

&gt;If these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this:

&gt;“And as I’ve mentioned, Washington Republicans, Independents, and Democrats have been quite content to sit quietly as pundits and candidates demean government and elected leaders, quite content to let the study of education fade from our schools, and all-too comfortable as our citizenry then becomes unaware and compliant. Unawareness remains rampant, but as the Sanders and Trump campaigns demonstrate, compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking…”

&gt;No “master-of-the-universe” conspiracy; just a lament that leaders and policy makers have not been sufficiently attentive to some of the basics that make our democracy great.

He laments Trump and the turning of the electoral process into reality TV, and when it comes down to compressing the problem into fewer words it turns out that a lack of compliance is the problem. It's dead obvious that he's only concerned with the loss of control due to Trump's game-changing campaign. Obviously, Trump is a conman and having such a president for an extended period of time will be a problem for most Americans. But you have to understand that the 'political class' experiences problems differently from the common Americans, and that him lamenting Trump does not *at all* mean that he is lamenting the betrayal of higher democratic ideals.

&gt;I think it's really apparent with the rest of the email that he is LAMENTING the fact that America has dropped the ball when it comes to civics and policy driven discourse.

*""The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum -- even encourage the more critical and dissident views.""* 

Trump has yanked the public out of this limited spectrum of acceptable opinion that you called 'policy-driven discourse' (hah).

A Clintonite! Welcome to my humble post! Well let's get to it. 

I took Ivey's quote from a single email and a brief one at that. There's not much context to remove. But let's review those two sentences of extra context:

&gt;JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. 

Ivey is...old. He probably hasn't seen this type of resistance from the American constituency for a long time. He's mistaking disgust with the government for celebrity worship. Trump's popularity was meant to be seen as a big, fat middle finger to the establishment, not some avid *Idiocracy*-like development. The fact that your kind are only able to read this rejection of establishment candidates as an ode to the power of celebrity just underscores how divorced you are from the reality on Main St. 

The American people didn't willingly vote for Trump. It was more like being extorted. A lot of election fraud had to occur to keep more desirable candidates out of the general election. 

&gt;Americans wanted to be enterained in that election, not given solutions to our problems.

That is not true at all. Again, a lot of election fraud occurred to keep every candidate but Hillary and the-only-man-who-had-a-chance-of-losing-to-Hillary out of the general election. I know that is quite the claim to make and unfortunately I cannot prove it in a few sentences or even another separate post, but rather a series of posts. I have the body of evidence to defend this claim, I just can't present it all in a single paragraph. 

Now let's take one last look at that damning quote:

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

If by ""we"" Ivey means American society in general, then I for one was not aware that we were all complicit in conspiring to stupefy ourselves through a sub-par education. I should have paid more attention at the meetings, I guess.  

Honestly, where do you get off spinning this shit? He clearly says ""we"" as in guys like him and Podesta **CONSPIRED** to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. No one was conspiring but him and his ilk, you gaslighting son-of-a-bitch. 

He proceeds to say that having an idiotic constituency is fine, but the fact that they're not compliant is a problem.

This all works for you insofar as you perceive yourself as on the winning end, completely helpless to even attempt to admit that this is an indeed hostile world, where your fellow humans will most likely not lift a finger to help you when you really need it. 

So much of that is nonsensical I'm overwhelmed with how to even start, so I won't. 

&gt;I continue to have some hope that you might turn to show me a beautiful and unpredictable expression, but that's just me.

That is just you. It's not realistic to hope for a spontaneous change of opinion without a logical reason to do so.  Just saying that you're right and I'm wrong doesn't make it so.

"epzjckw","#**Character Rankings**

**One World**

**Season Ranking: 36/38**

**Cast Average: 461.61 (35th)**

One World is another really, really, really boring and bad season. Terrible characters, a predictable steamroll, and so much more spell doom for this season. Just so little going on. I used to have it at 38/38 but I realized I hated RI and Caramoan more, but this is still awful. 

**18. Colton Cumbie 1.0**: Colton, in a span of only 6 episodes, was able to be racist, classist, and generally despicable during One World. He spends his time solely with the girls, then is somehow in power, gets his entire tribe (including Bill!) to throw immunity away to vote Bill out because Colton is an aforementioned racist and classist person, but don’t worry he has a black housemaid so everything is ok! He then bonds more with Alicia during the postswap by making fun of Christina for being Asian. He is then anticlimactically medevaced instead of getting the downfall he so desperately deserves after his insanely negative edit, killing both his character and the season. Awful.

Overall Ranking: 685/691

**17. Alicia Rosa**: Does plenty of stuff that is just as bad as Colton does, such as the mentioned above mocking of Christina for being Asian, or that time where she compared Christina to a special-ed kid even though she was a special-ed teacher at the time, which is just such a great look. Also she has one of the most laughably unaware and egomaniacal jury speeches this side of David, funny that they ended up hooking up, they fit perfectly together!

Overall Ranking: 674/691

**16. Tarzan Smith**: Lucky for him the two below him are some of the worst characters Survivor has ever produced, because if he was on literally *any other season*, Tarzan would be recognized for just how awful of a character he is. He feels only a shade less forced than Phillip, which isn’t a good thing, he does visually repugnant things like walk around in what is basically a bikini bottom, which is fucking disgusting, and he says things that are morally repugnant, such as the time he claimed racism wasn’t real because at the time we had a black president. Oh but he’s funny though hahahahahahahaha (spoiler: he’s not).

Overall Ranking: 667/691

**15. Leif Manson**: Such awful stunt casting it hurts me to even write about how he was stunt casting. He was only cast because of his size and does nothing worth a damn during his small time on screen. He is notable for genuinely being the 2nd worst casting choice in the history of the show.

Overall Ranking: 625/691

**14. Matt Quinlan**: Bland, boring alpha male who gives Colton power in the game because he can’t count.

Overall Ranking: 588/691

**13. Jay Byars**: Is genuinely one of the most boring and bland people ever cast, and this is on One World! He ruins the sole attempt of a coup on Kim by squealing like a pleasure pig as soon as Troyzan comes up with a halfway competent plan.

Overall Ranking: 551/691

**12. Nina Acosta**: She called Kat an idiot (which isn’t false at all), and started some fights. That’s all I can remember. 

Overall Ranking: 539/691

**11. Troyzan Robertson 1.0**: He brings something, but the problem is most of the time that something is generic and/or boring. I don’t like generic underdogs, and Troyzan is just that in the “THIS IS MY ISLAND!!!!” episode, where he also gets an ungodly amount of screentime for no real reason at all (fun fact Troyzan in the This is My Island episode gets 14 confessionals, which equals his total confessional number for GC).

Overall Ranking: 531/691

**10. Monica Culpepper 1.0**: The first iteration of our Neat Lady is fine. She doesn’t do anything wrong nor does she do anything spectacular, but she is a nice older lady who works hard which is seriously helpful on NuManono with bottom-tier shit like Tarzan, Leif, Colton, and Alicia on her tribe.

Overall Ranking: 474/691

**9. Kim Spradlin**: She is so good at the game of Survivor she single handedly ruins a season. Kim may be a great player, but boy, as a TV character, she is not great. Kim is just boring and mostly dull, but she has her moments, like the pig slaughter or the idol in her crotch. Otherwise a very disappointing character at the very best because she’s just so boring.

Overall Ranking: 467/691

**8. Bill Posley**: He’s a pretty funny guy, who knows how to use some good self-deprecating humor (or so it seems), early on. But then his content is literally 100% related to Colton being a bigot, so he can’t actually rank high on my rankings, even if I have a bunch of respect for him and feel bad for how his experience turned out.

Overall Ranking: 443/691

**7. Kourtney Moon** - She was the best casting choice on the season and went out during the first challenge due to an injury. Speaks to the quality of OW. I liked her aesthetic though and think she had some stuff going on.

Overall Ranking: 433/691

**6. Michael Jefferson**: He’s ok? He just has some weirdly odd or quirky yet funny moments that kinda just happen in the background away from the action. Like him stealing from the girls supplies at the opening rush when it was totally unnecessary, just weird shit that you kinda just tilt your head at in genuine surprise, which on a shitty season like OW will get you this high.

Overall Ranking: 413/691

**5. Kat Edorsson 1.0**: She’s honestly a pretty funny character to laugh at even if some of her moments seem super fake. She provides a tiny bit of life in a season that has next to none and I do like that. Her FTC speech is pretty great as well.

Overall Ranking: 280/691

**4. Jonas Otsuji**: He’s one of the few charismatic speakers on the cast and that carries him a lot. Other than that he’s a pretty good voice of reason for the shit that is this season and he has some fun background moments like being genuinely astounded to the point of having to bury his head in his hands when Tarzan goes off on his race spiel. I like his FTC speech too.

Overall Ranking: 260/691

**3. Chelsea Meissner**: I like her. She has some (good) spunk and attitude and that can’t be overstated on such a terrible season. She has some fun moments like her getting on Tarzan over plastic surgery (anyone getting on Tarzan is a positive to me), or when she talks about liking Jay and Troy, but liking money more. It’s the only time I laughed while watching One World, and yes I kept track of that.

Overall Ranking: 248/691

**2. Christina Cha**: Is laughably bad at Survivor. She is so bad at Survivor it is comical, and not in a played-up, forced way like Kat. She is genuinely an awful player. She basically quits at F4, and that always makes me crack a smile, plus she brings out some really good stuff from Sabrina. Also she stays likable in the face of Colton and Alicia so that helps as well.

Overall Ranking: 233/691

**1. Sabrina Thompson**: She has some really good if not great moments and that easily carries her to #1. Of course the main one everyone will think of is her top-tier Day 39 confessional which is of course excellent, but she also has some great voting confessionals towards the end of the game, to Kat and Christina. I think she was the most engaging speaker as well and that easily makes her my #1 for this season.

"epydyyd","For a better - if much older - example, look back at *The Beverly Hillbillies* in its portrayals of rural (especially Southern rural) people. Compare and contrast with *The Andy Griffith Show*, which had a broad spectrum of rural Southern characters, instead of the one-dimensional ""ignorant hick"" stereotypes of *The Beverly Hillbillies*.

As to how these two shows relate to *The Big Bang Theory*? Simple: in-group vs. out-group dynamics. In *The Beverly Hillbillies*, all of the main characters (as in *The Big Bang Theory*) form an in-group that, both as individuals and as a collective, are completely unaware and unable to function in the society around them, versus the out-group members of society, who routinely take advantage of the situation, only to be undone by their *own* actions. The principle characters exist to be laughed AT, rather than WITH, and no character exists within the show as an audience surrogate, so someone watching can put themselves ""into the show"", imagination making enjoyment of the show deeper and more than just a passive experience. Again, compare this to *The Andy Griffith Show*, where there *is* an audience surrogate (Sherrif Taylor), and while there are certainly characters to be laughed at, and *wildly* stereotypical ones at that - looking at you, Ernest T. Bass! - the laughing was done by both the in- and the out-groups within the show, thus making the characters ones you laugh WITH and not AT, even when you are laughing at the antics of a particular one of the characters. 

As far as *Rosanne* and *Blackish*, the humor in those shows is more in the vein of *The Andy Griffith Show*, in that most of the comedy results from in-group interaction, with brief interaction of in-group vs out-group - but even in the latter, the protagonists of both shows are often equal, if not the winners of any interaction. Contrast this to *The Beverly Hillbillies*, *The Big Bang Theory* or *Two and A Half Men*, the majority of the ""humor"" derived from what I refer to as ""rubber crutch jokes"": the main characters, unaware and/or unable to function on the same level of competence as the average person, fall down (in the interpersonal and social sense) repeatedly.

But that can happen in combat. If you sneak up on someone and they're surprised, you don't automatically shove them. If someone is unconscious from Sleep or stunned by Hypnotic Pattern, you don't automatically shove them.

It sounds like you don't think they're realistic given the circumstance, which I'd agree with. Personally, I'd give the shovee disadvantage on their ability check. This represents then being unaware and unprepared.

"eordl76","Do you need to justify a position if you're 'not' a thing?   

Anyway I eat meat. Lot's of meat. I love it.   

The morality of killing another creature is very subjective and all comes down to where you personally draw the line. I've often thought how hypocritical it is of vegans to drive around in their Prius's telling the world how they don't harm animals but they ignore all the bugs splattered on the grill. Ignore the number of parts that use petro carbons (plastics, lubricants, fabrics, rubber) and nasty acids (the battery) to produce and ignore the harmful effect that has on the environment both directly through pollutants and indirectly through the process of obtaining these base materials.    

The point of what I'm saying is that you too (making the assumption here that you are the vegan we're discussing) have a subjective line in the sand where you say ""this is good, that is bad"". I'm simply OK with killing a few more creatures than you and I'm OK with it because I put them to good use. I don't accept their loss simply as a byproduct of my lifestyle.   

I'll also point out that I hunt. This doesn't only mean I shoot things. It means that I manage the land, keep invasive plant and animal species in check, remove and report sick game animals, maintain the waterways, pick up litter. Then I shoot something. I clean it, skin it, process the meat, and eventually cook and eat it. I know where my food comes from. I was there when it died and I've felt the anguish of it not being done cleanly. I respect my food.

Strawman. No one is saying we can't have female super hero series and movies. I watched Jessica Jones even though Kristen Ritter can't act for shit, and relatively enjoyed it. I'd watch a Hit Girl series if there was one. Hell, I'd watch a Bat Girl series. But this is not that.

This is so completely unaware and ironically horrible that I can't even begin to explain, but I'll try.

This show seeks to do to Batman what TLJ did to Star Wars; take a male space/character, neuter it, replace it with a woman, then claim superiority, and this can be seen in the last line ""I'm not about to let a man take credit for a woman's work.""

This is complete bullshit nonsense crap. Batman, Bruce Wayne, builds the entire hero from nothing as an arguably insane man, builds the bat cave, the suit, the gadgets, fights, risks his life etc. and then this girl who weighs 110 pounds and can apparently take on grown men thugs in fights, waltzes in and acts like she's the shit and she did something. She didn't. She's simply stepping into Batman's already established everything and then going ""I am woman, hear me roar!""

Also, her character looks unbelievably shallow and nonsensical. **NO** women who act like her exist. This is a problem I have had with Hollywood for maybe ten years or so, and is actually an issue I have with Emilia Clarke's character on Game of Thrones. 

The Khaleesi just simply is not a believable type of person. She has no depth. She simply stares stone faced all the time and gives orders like she's not worried about anything. Hell, Jon Snow shows more humanity than her, more emotion than her, more depth and complexity and openness with his emotions, and don't give me that crap about her upbringing etc. **NO ONE** exists like the Khaleesi and she's an unbelievable character, and a boring one for most of the series. This Batwoman character is just like that and I don't even need to see the show to know it.

Bruce is a complicated character. He's flawed, arguably crazy and scarred by his past. He has ideals. He breaks down from time to to time. Even Christian Bale never has any moments in his trilogy where you think Batman is invincible or has a full handle on his emotions. This trailer makes Batwoman look like every other typical stonefaced Hollywood ""strong female"" that has no basis in reality and no females actually want to be. This is what they don't understand.

No women want to be Captain Marvel or Wonderwoman or Batwoman. These characters/comics were *aimed at male readers and primarily purchased by them*, and the girls who did buy them, were huge comic nerds who are not your average girl, especially back then. 

Women do not aspire to be stone faced ass kickers wearing leather with short hair cuts. They just don't. This fantasy appeals to literally no one, and because Batwoman appears to lack any femininity, and is obviously a Lesbian, she won't appeal to male viewers either in the way that someone like Ripley or Sarah Conner or Ney'Tiri does.

Sure, there will be a few people out there who dig this, but it's primarily just a complete middle finger to men from idealogues who have to literally do what Batwoman does in this show--take something already built up by men and reclaim it and take credit for it.

You know what? Come up with something new. Create a complex female superhero and put her on screen. At least Jessica Jones was interesting as a person, despite Kristen Ritter's horrible acting. Hit Girl was awesome. Show me **real femininity** with some super powers behind it or something and I'll watch the shit out of it. But don't just dress a tiny girl up in a Batman costume and give her a dyke hair cut and a lesbian gf and call it a day.

You can try and educate people but you shouldn’t tell them what to do as that really doesn’t go well,  like ever. 


You also have to realise one important thing. People who sell on Etsy as hobby and side income are etsy’s target market. Etsy is specifically targeting them. At one point, etsy ceo made a forum q&amp;a where he referred to “spreading the love” and trying to increase the income people get from Etsy, so it represents higher contribution to their household budget (it was worded way better but the idea is the same). 

Etsy fully knows that their target market are women, often stay at home moms who would love to contribute to their budget and Etsy “makes it easy.” Etsy knows it full well and caters towards them with their modern feminist approach (we’re  proud because 80% of our seller are women or identify as women). They know it and they use very well. They use feminist agenda against women who are simply unaware of that. as a women it really pisses me off. I hate being treated like I need special treatment because I’m a woman and obviously I can’t  achieve success without superficial limits imposed by the government or big businesses to make sure everything is 50/50 instead of allowing the best at excelling. But Etsy uses it, they put it in pretty words and stats and proudly show it to their sellers. 

Ultimately, etsy is not ideal for professional sellers. Their tools are very limited, their stats poor. Any business that solely relies on etsy should really rethink their business model as that’s asking for trouble. Etsy is made for people who have no experience in ecommerce, the dashboard is as basic as it  can get yet you still have people who are throughly confused about how Etsy works. And again, etsy is fully aware, they don’t cater towards full time sellers, if they did, they’d have to make some significant changes to the site. They don’t want that, they want as many people paying for seller services as possible and unaware and not business savvy people are the easiest target. Full time sellers often keep a close eye on their finances, they know when they have to cut the cost. That’s not always true with part time sellers. 

But like I have mentioned above, you shouldn’t tell people what they can or cannot do. You end up sounding preachy. And while I do understand your intentions, I don’t think you fully grasp the full time sellers side on Etsy either.  You are under the impression that all of us use Etsy advertising with huge budgets. That’s simply not true (not for everyone).

"elwlmsc","&gt; Did Vivec erase his father from existence?

There are a few subtle referrences to Vivec's ""real"" father (i.e not Sotha Sil) :

&gt; He was born in the ash among the Velothi, anon Chimer, before the war with the northern men. Ayem came first to the village of the netchimen, and her shadow was that of Boethiah, who was the Prince of Plots, and things unknown and known would fold themselves around her until they were like stars or the messages of stars. Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:
&gt;
&gt; 'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. In you is an image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'
&gt;
&gt; Then Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where dreughs took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might give birth to the image as an egg. There she stayed for seven or eight months.
&gt;
&gt; — [***The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec, Sermon One***](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_1)

Vivec's father was a [netchiman](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Netchiman%27s_Lament) (he bred or hunted netches).

&gt; The light bent, and somewhere a history was finally undone. Of it, Vivec remembered the laughing of the netchimen of his village when the hunts were good. He marched with his father in the ash, growing strong in the hooks and sail, able to run a junk through silt. At eleven, he sung to an ashkhan. He became sick after Red Mountain, with the nix-blood and fever, and was infirm a hundred years. His mother survived him and laid his body at the altar of Padhome. She gave him her skin to wear into the underworld.

Vivec might have been sexually abused by his father, or anything really, because this quote is extremely obscure and filled with metaphors, so who knows what it actually means?

&gt; If Vivec has CHIM, is this not impossible to ""drain"" from him?

That's not how CHIM works. What was drained was his powersource, his link to the Divine Energy of the Heart of Lorkhan.

&gt; Vivec relies more on CHIM and can exist without the power from the heart right?

Vivec is extremely reliant on the Heart, without it, he is simply a mortal, albeit an enlightened one. He tells us so in TES3:Morrowind :

&gt; ""That is very sad. I presume Almalexia killed Sotha Sil. I thought she might harm me. And I presume she tried to kill you, Nerevarine. It is all very sad. But death comes to all mortals -- and we are all mortal now. In time, death will come to me, Nerevarine -- perhaps even at your hands. It is futile to deny one's fate. But, nonetheless, I'm afraid I find it all very, very sad that it should end this way, something that began in such glory and noble promise.""

&gt; How would Vivec be blind to Barbas as his head priest?

It grants obscure knowledge, not omniscience. Vivec was unaware and ignorant of many things, the first quest of ESO involves Vivec sending one of his priests to ask questions to an ancestor spirit :

&gt; ""Ask the Warrior-Poet's questions, Outlander.""
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; ""Ah, Lord Vivec always had a way with words!  
&gt; Tell him to rest assured. The Heart remains safe. I wonder why that concerns him? Ask the remaining questions, as my time here is short.""
&gt;
&gt; &gt; **Lord Vivec asks, ""Has the enemy of old returned, so devious and bold?""**
&gt;
&gt; ""An enemy of old, yes, but not the one that Vivec presumes.""

All depression, guilt, shame, fear, and anger are built upon pain.

The difference is in how one reacts to the pain. If a guy take your wallet, you might feel like the world sucks and you suck (depression), you should have protected it better or voted Democrat so that people aren't poor enough to want to steal wallets (guilt), freak out about your situation (anxiety), never want to go outside or in crowds again (fear / anxiety), or go for vengeance against the guy to teach him a lesson (anger).

Society tends to pity depression and anxiety because it's a person in pain but in a relatively harmless state.

Most people fear anger on the other hand, so will try to avoid you, condemn you, or hate you for showing anger.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived in my Brooklyn apartment from March 1, 2011 through Memorial Day Weekend 2013 (I'm good with dates, that's why I  remember this.).  I smoked pot every one of those days except maybe four or five.  I had the number for the courier service (which I still keep in my phone for nostalgia purposes) and placed an order for a ""ticket"" every Sunday night like *clockwork*.  Each of these little containers cost $50.00 and always lasted me exactly one week.  So that's 200/month. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 2011 - May 2013 is a 27 month span.  So I spent $5,400 during my time at that apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I pay my guy using Venmo and was able to look at what I paid him in the last 12 month period.  That figure is $1,920.00, or $160/month.  I think that's a perfectly good number to use for an annual figure from May 2013 to the present.  So lets use that $160/month figure and prorate it from June 2013 to March 2019 (not counting April since we're only 9 days in.).   I think that's a 70 month span right?  That's (gulp) $11,200.00

&amp;#x200B;

So since March of 2011 I've spent \[11,200  + 5,400\]..................... $16,600 on weed.

They can use the TiNe functions to think of the smartest and most destructive ways possible, to destroy anyone or anything.  Be it his enemy's emotions... or the enemy's body and life.

Bruce Banner is an INTP.  When he becomes enraged, he becomes the Hulk.  Good analogy.

I think caring about things, motivation, will to do stuff, etc. is a thing we can’t prove exists.  But that thing that makes us care is more real than anything physical I  think

As I’m writing this, I feel like I care strongly about writing it. I don’t know why, but I do. I can give reasons like “I want to connect with someone similar” or “I want to help someone likeminded” but the real reason is our of my grasp.

The worst thing is that the more I’m consciously aware of how much I care about something. I suddenly care about it less.  It’s like once I know I might care about doing a thing, I start to SEE myself caring about it.  Like I’m watching myself in a movie.  I start to ask myself why I care about it.  Is is worthwhile? Is it good to care about it?  Will caring about it just let myself down when I fail again for the thousandth time?  I start to hate myself like how you would secretly hate a character in a movie if it’s basically a shitty version of yourself.  

This fucking cycle of self awareness detaches me from whatever it is that makes me care about things.  After a while, I feel like I’m just floating by, and the thing I cared about is gone.  It’s so constant

I think doomers are so detached and apathetic because all the time they’re not detatched they are so self aware of everything they are doing.  You’re either in painful self awareness, or blind detached mode. They are self aware of their failure and constantly punish themselves for it. They are conscious of their dreams, and punish themselves for failing them and later for forgetting their dreams altogether.  They push it all away and become robots just to feel less pain for a while

I think the only thing that’s keeping me caring about things is becoming blind to myself.  I genuinely want to see myself less like the main character in a movie. Becoming unfeeling and unaware and uncaring about everything at first actually works.  Being completely on autopilot.  Then you suddenly realize you’ve started to care about something after a long time of being blind to everything.  And I think that feeling that I actually lived in the moment for a bit is a bit of light at the end of the tunnel

Hilldawg and Obama studied Saul Alinsky who, in order to enact socialism,  required rhe use of the uninformed populace... the useful idiot. 

And to quote John Pedo Podesta: ""And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.”


How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:
There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.
The first is the most important.
1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people
2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.
3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.
4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.
5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).
6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.
7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.
8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.

"eiwt2s6","It's early 2000 and the Indian Railway's travel is still infamous for loots and burglary frequenting on longer route trains during late nights.

I am not sure of the route but I suppose Mr. Jena was traveling from West Bengal to Odisha on the Eastern Coastal region. It was a Sleeper Compartment mostly reserved by passengers traveling back after attending marriage functions, as it was the wedding season in the east.

Exhausted and overfed most of the travelers were killing time by either playing cards or participating in loud conversations as the next station was way behind schedule and the train had halted on a dark patch between rice fields. Music similar to that of a typical village marriage function can be heard from a distance, and one can see the celebratory lights far in the east.

After a halt of 15 minutes finally, the train starts moving. As soon as it catches speed a skinny man jumps inside the coach. Covered with a blanket from head to feet, looks at the completely full compartment and walks to one of the side berths, sits comfortably while catching up on his breath loudly.

It's evident that he is traveling without a ticket and is one of the poor villagers who will get down at the next station.

Mr. Jena offers him a water bottle to which he shrugs as if he was irritated by the discomfort of being disturbed, while he anxiously looked out of the window of the moving train. A few minutes later a lady notices blood trickling from the poor man's feet. Alarmed she asks one of the men to inquire and help him, as the blanket man constantly looked out of the window at the passing villages in the dark. Worried, Mr. Jena enquired of the blanket man if he was hurt and needs medical help. He shrugs back again, louder and puts his feet inside the blanket while crouching under the blanket with just his eyes popping out of it.  One thing was very evident that there was continuous metal clinking sound coming from the blanket man as if he was carrying it in his hands, and covering it for safety reasons.

Tensions uprising around the berth as the blanket is soaked in red blood now and the man seems to be unaware and unaffected by the blood loss sits in the same posture without even shrieking from the pain.

Finally, other passengers question him about his whereabouts, name and where was he headed to? Startled by the increasing tension he spits at the floor and curses back at the passengers. One of the men gets up angrily to catch hold of him and finally teach him a lesson and report him to the TTE. As soon as the angry passenger tries to catch hold of the blanket, he jumps off the seat and heads towards the door. To everyone's surprise, he jumps out of the running train into complete darkness.

This is rather lengthy, but at the end of the day. **I see myself as being on a CRUSADE** to CALL OUT the EXPLOITERS. First off. At the end of the day, YOU who received those messages have CLEARLY and without a doubt have violated the online code of conduct for PSN services.
Google it, read it and understand what you're all doing ( those who repeatedly abused relentless and practically comical, scripted, algorithmic to a t exploits to manipulate the game and abuse it.
Now I wasn't bragging about my record today; that's where you interpreted it wrong. After playing this game since launch and having to experience the ups and downs and patches, they had a game that was ruined by so many , and it spread like a cancer.

You're basically playing ""the same guy, scoring the same goal, the same way"" when you get near the top divisions and the game"" catered "" to their exploits.

I would get DESTROYED by some of you, like 15- 6 whatever; but I never quit. I played the game and had the most frustrating time playing ' defend the glitch'

Now all I was trying to get across was that today, there wasn't 5 or more short side glitchers in consecutive games for the first time since October!

Something was up ! The tuner seems to have brought more parity in the game. Today, I played 4 people in Div 1 and try as they might all game they COULDN'T use their GO TO bread and butter move.
I need to figure out how to post pictures on here. I would LOVE to share the transcripts back and forth from some people.
Everyone who does it ( and you know if you exploit this ) is so unaware and oblivious to it which is the most upsetting part when they reply.
I have sent countless messages to players who allow messages both in victory and defeat. I commend those few Div 1 players who actually START with Horton as their starting defenceman and play a fast back and forth game ( which I'll lose probably) but at least it's not hanging to play ' protect against the glitch'

Many say the short side isn't a 'glitch'

Wrong. When you can score on 6 out of 10 of the exact button/stick configuration ; kid- you're exploiting the game !!
I really would love to have all those 'guys' who killed me 13 -1 14 -2 and scored the SAME goal the SAME way try and argue that what they're doing isn't a problem !!That was just the breaking point for me. It's exploitation pure and simple and there's nothing left to discuss !!

Defend it then

Get gud

Whatever you've changed it from playing hockey to having to constantly know to play for repetitive plays from the same spot like a Swiss clock.
I started out with 1993 nhlpa hockey for the sega genesis

You could basically 'short side glitch two ways ' so I'm not unaware of EA's play. Anyhow. Back in the day, we'd play. If someone scored 5 or 6 'glitchers' they knew they were probably getting a charley horse They knew better. They knew it was a 'cop out' Yeah two or three go in. I get it. 5 -6 and it's 9-2 and you STILL are chasing the SAME thing. The thing that sucks is that now you don't get the Charley horse anymore, because you're playing online in your parents basement and just love playing the style you choose to, that of pure exploitation.

"eiw3ua2","But I'm pretty sure Arthas was binding them to his will and effectively mind controlling all of them. Later when something happened that weakened him, can't remember what, his grip weakened and Sylvanas and some others broke free from his control. 

Sylvanas didn't want to be like Arthas so she didn't use any mind controlling things. She also thought undeath was a curse.

So that's why I dislike it. This of course isn't the first time undead that Sylvanas has risen has acted like this. I can't remember the details but in some battle Sylvanas raised a bunch of human soldiers that had just died and they immediately started attacking those they had fought beside. Now apparently this still wasn't mind control and they where just confused by suddenly being thrust into undeath without any warning and therefore struck out at anyone around them. Now this is a pretty iffy explanation but I can accept it, though not very happy about it. 

The problem is when the people that are undead start to show any form of reasoning, by monologuing, it kinda kills the whole ""unaware and confused"" argument. 

So that's the problem for me. Arthas was stated to mind control so actions make sense. Sylvanas is stated to not mind control and people just decide to join her and do a 180 in character just like that.

Sure, there are some characters which don't change their alignment when being undeaded, but there's no difference to how they where raised so it only points toward blizzard not really caring and doing whatever they feel like while ignoring characters and earlier established lore.",1553015125,"the problem is when the people that are undead start to show any form of reasoning, by monologuing, it kinda kills the whole ""unaware and confused"" argument.","unaware and confused","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and confused","confused",NA,NA,1

 I would personally say that the worst we can do right now is attack the immigrants - they are simply peons in the psychopathic games played by the elites, victims of circumstances, of unneeded and atrocious wars and a transformation of their native lands into hell-scapes. 

At this point, we need to stand together, firm, as a people. United and not divided.

Then the psychopaths in power need to be ousted in order for peace to reign again. Only once peace and order is restored can we begin talking about which countries desire to remain culturally more culturally homogeneous and which countries desire to be more multi-cultural. In my view, neither is wrong, neither is right. It is a decision of the people, but the people from all sides should decide where they want to live and how.

"eii3maa","***""Make a perception check.""***

*""Five""*

***""You fail to notice the enemy sneaking up behind you before he cuts your throat. Start work on a new character whilst everyone else rolls initiative.""***

If your players aren't okay with this, free ""stealth kills"" maybe shouldn't be a part of your game.

IMO often when players ask to do something like this they've not thought about what it actually entails. Here's the process they'd go through for a stealth kill:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Approach and draw your weapon silently enough that your enemy doesn't notice you right behind them.
2. Make a strike that is powerful and precise enough to kill instantly, is silent enough not to alert others and quick enough that they don't have a chance to make a noise.
3. Simultaneously prevent them from shouting/collapsing to the floor with  crash and dropping their weapons, which would also create enough noise to alert anyone near enough to hear a shout.

The assassin rule is often misread as being any attack before the enemy acts, but in fact they only auto crit  if they get a surprise round, which represents the enemy being totally unaware and unprepared. This surprise mechanic is there precisely to cover things like ambushes and stealth kills. It's a full round of advantage attacks with no chance for the guards to respond. First round after that you roll initiative, which represents how quickly the guards react to the surprise attack. If your players roll better on initiative they get a second chance to take them out before they have a chance to alert their comrades. If any guards are alive on their turn then your party haven't been quick and quiet enough to take them out before they can raise the alarm.",1552564260,"the assassin rule is often misread as being any attack before the enemy acts, but in fact they only auto crit  if they get a surprise round, which represents the enemy being totally unaware and unprepared.","unaware and unprepared","unaware","and",FALSE,"totally unaware and unprepared","unprepared","totally",NA,1

"ei3ov6s","^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

My fiancée believes I cheated on her. I did not, but she has big reasons to believe so. She caught me red-handed literally, it's just someone plunged my hand in their blood while I was asleep and unaware, and she doesn't believe that part. So, she believes I cheated on her and it is hard to blame her for believing so, as if she believed me she would be kind of a fool. But I never cheated on anyone.

I really wanted to fix our relationship, I made all the oathes, all the promises, professed our love all I could. I tried hard, and I tried long. But all she was seeing was that I cheated on her and I wouldn't admit to it. Eventually she broke off the relationship as she couldn't see it work. I tried to avoid reaching harrassment-level, but I still for a while reached to her trying to appeal to her how our relationship was the greatest. I stopped when she started seeing other men so casually that even I knew. The stop was abrupt. Not a complete stubborn no-contact, and I didn't give a reason, but contact between us used to be me trying again and again to convince her, and suddenly it was just her sometimes asking about mundane things about our past common interests.

We've been separated for about six months. Recently she's reached out to me asking if we could see to go back to our relationship, and she mentionned possibly to the engagement. I told her no, that we're better as friends with a history now. However, considering how everyone saw me pursue her long and hard, with my life, the drastic difference that came abruptly is understandably puzzling. She's confused about what changed, and she pressured me for answers. I told her I don't think she believes me now that I'm innocent, and it wouldn't be good for either of us to live in such a relationship with that big an awkward stain. Well, it's true that it is one of my reasons. But that was the case from the start and that didn't stop me from pursuing her long and hard at first. She's still asking about why now that became ""don't even think of getting back together.""

Well I have reason two. I just don't want to get back to someone I was engaged to, who then broke up with me and slept with other people. That situation is not marriage material to me. All I can see is she had the opportunity to not go to other people, and she discarded that opportunity. When I commit to someone to the point that I want to marry them, we will have no such thing to deal with. As far as I'm concerned, we were meant to be until she made us not meant to be. I don't think she did bad. I think I would waste valuable time of my life being with her when I could be spending it finding my best life instead. Exploring other great people who'd be great life partners without having to deal with them going elsewhere when they feel like it. Or just making the best of being single.

But I don't feel like telling her that. All she'll hear and tell everyone is me accusing her of cheating anyway.

"ei2lqwe","What you are saying is that the education system is a linear approach, more than that, that treatments are also linear.

The underlying problem is science.

Science is a linear approach to the world. It aims to see patterns in reality, which are universal laws. Look at the structure of schooling. It is a linear progression through classes, that are defined by the school year, every student needs to be, literally, on the same page. 

Knowledge is stratified based on assumptions of the ability at certain ages to understand the curriculum. We have kids all about the same age depending on whether a kid got into the system at age 3 or 4. 

What is taught are, of course, the sciences. The emphasis is not an pleasure time, or free work, or drawing or play. It is about calculus, math and languages, which are all linear abilities. Things logically structured.

Our whole society is based on a scientific paradigm. Logically treatments, also treatments in the class room will follow that paradigm.

Which translates to, one size fits all. And that expression may originally be about clothing, but it is a clear expression of the conveyor belt mentality, in no way is the ABA program different: instead of a manufacturing plant where raw materials go in and finished product roll out, a building where raw autistic kids go in and are processed and when properly adjusted, roll out is in its basis similar.

This mentality is so deeply ingrained in our society that treatment follows an industrial approach and in this system, caregivers, ABA specialists and all sorts of medical workers must work...and resist the idea of the mass production of health and generalized and financial accountability.

For if the child is not helped after a preset program, goals aren't reached, a broken product leaves the factory.

How can a therapist come away from their own societal paradigms? This is very hard because the therapy room is the only place where this paradigm won't work and yet they support this paradigm everywhere else in their lives, unaware and unquestioned.

So to me this sort of discussion will never lead anywhere because, I suppose it could be described as a McLuhanist perspective.

We do not on a daily basis understand what drives our society. 

So they autiekid that gets into ABA will basically be submitted to an industrial, conveyor belt system that necessarily presupposes a child to behave similarly to a product, where a product in these conditions are all the same. Each coffee maker has a number that goes up, they are all the same size, so, standardized. There is an expectation on the finished product.

The delusion is that any type of raw material coming in can be processed to produce a more or less similar result. And the goals is the same for each kid, this is the linear approach.

Any therapy that does not get away by this understanding and these principles will ultimately be a failure.

Now, for most NT people, being in this education system there is no problem. Why?

&gt;""People are not machines but in every opportunity where they are allowed to behave like machines, they will so behave.""

\-- Ludwig von Bertalanffy

For an autistic human mind with its principle differences and impairments, this need not apply. It is the NT world here that behaves autistically. 

Being a minority inverses the situation. Suddenly the system cannot linearly continue its assumption on the raw material, to be indoctrinated with they system, by the system. You see how that works? :-)

The spectral kids need non-linear approaches. And this is interesting because *state changes* cause stress in autistic people. You would expect an autie person to love the linear approach because it is dependable, logical and predictable. 

People who work a conveyor belt will tell you that although the work is tedious and boring, it is the social aspect that carries them through. The jokes with co-workers, the lunch, the feeling you are in it together, for your low pay.

An autistic person will more likely than not get the benefit of this interaction.

Health care these days is all about goals, accountability, standardized treatment plans, it is all quantifiable to the last cent. The scientific paradigm rules there too. You are expected that your spider phobia can be treated with 10 sessions and 4 virtual reality encounters. After that you are on your own. If more treatment is needed, apply again for the same program. Basically, if a coffee maker is faulty, send it back in for repairs.

&gt;Trump doesn’t? He seems to say our country needs a wall despite the facts? He seems to say that the tax cuts would help the middle class despite the facts, that businesses receiving tax breaks would pass those on despite the facts, on and on.

Two problems here: 

First, none of these supposed statements deal in moral arguments. The moral argument would be that the state doesn't have any inherent right to seize goods or assets to fund services, and so cannot morally justify imposing taxes on people in the first place. 

As for the economic arguments (which yours are), we just disagree on what claims are more empirically defended, like how higher taxes are demotivating to worker productivity (""The state's just gonna take it anyway, so why bother working for its benefit?""); or how higher taxes limit private-sector expanses against the normal supply and demand of the private market and distorts the proper allocation of resources; or how ""taxing the rich"" (the people who actually pay most of the taxes) doesn't increase tax revenues (because they have the resources to pay to find and exploit tax loopholes), but instead encourages them to store their money elsewhere. I can cite all of these, if you insist.

&gt;Are you saying that the difference is that aoc is aware of her ignorance yet marches on while trump is unaware and blissfully ignorant and so it’s ok? If not can you dumb your argument down a little bit?

 I know her intentions are good and she meant well but there is a larger cultural issue where we obsess over marriage and act as if it's the be all end all. Marriages crumble. Divorce happens. Spouses pass away. There might be infidelity. Or infertility. Sometimes crazy in laws ruin the marriage. Sometimes life gets in the way. There are so many potential problems associated with marriage and nobody teaches you how to problem solve, how to communicate with your spouse, how to be a good parent, how to get through the rough patches, etc. All anyone ever talks about is get married and have a nice wedding you're left to figure out the actual business of staying married on your own.

And secondly if young people are going to be pushed into marriage (or rush into it themselves) let's at least equip them with the knowledge they need to make it a long lasting, healthy and successful marriage. Let's talk about all the tough subjects regarding marriage instead of hiding behind the ""it's taboo"" excuse. Let's teach them what their rights and responsibilities are. For the love of God let's talk about the proper way to raise children so we don't have another generation of emotionally unaware and overbearing (or even abusive) parents who learned nothing from their own upbringing. Marriage comes with so much responsibility and I feel like as Muslims we downplay that responsibility and focus on superficial things like getting the highest Mehr possible and having a big fancy wedding to impress our peers. Idk. If I am entering a lifelong partnership with someone I'm going to think very long and hard about it before making that decision ",1546793700,"for the love of god let's talk about the proper way to raise children so we don't have another generation of emotionally unaware and overbearing (or even abusive) parents who learned nothing from their own upbringing.","unaware and overbearing","unaware","and",FALSE,"emotionally unaware and overbearing","overbearing","emotionally",NA,1

"eddov3q","The whole point of that is that you are still making a choice no? Inaction is still an action. You may decide its less wrong morally but it isn’t devoid of wrongness. 

Some people might even say that your choice is the most morally wrong. Because you are only considering yourself and the consequences of yourself. Some moral philosophies would say that the selfish reasoning makes you the most morally wrong no matter what the choice was. That considering the impact of yourself over 6 other people is wrong.

And the question is: even in your inaction is it the same sort of inaction as someone who is on the opposite side of the world when it occurs? No. We can all agree you are still more culpable than someone completly unaware and unable to help in the scenerio. 

What about this variation of the trolley problem (its important to look at variations to test your choice and the logic behind it). 

You’re on a sinking ship. One person is on one side drowning and someone else is on another side drowning. You can save one of them to no detriment of yourself but you can never save both. What do you do? Your logic would dictate you save neither. You let both die. Is that genuinly your decision.

Or: you’re in a selfdriving car on a bridge. It’s gone haywire. 5 people are on the pavement. The car is about to drive off the bridge and kill you. The only choice is to swerve. Swerving will kill those 5 people and save yourself. Your logic would say you would save yourself. Personal gain. Yourself above others. Yes?

The last one: a zombie apocalypse is imminent. You are the only person in the world that we know of that is immune. The government has found you. They predict that the world will fall into ruin, humanity will end, suffering abound. Classic zombie. But the apocalypse will only happen in about 80 years when you’re dead. The government needs to havrest your organs (which will kill you) and spend the next 60 years creating and spreading a cure before it happens. Literally billions of lives will be saved. But you’ll have to die right now.

"ebr2i6r","My grandfather died from Alzheimer's when I was still in high school. I was expelled that year, so I was in the library 4 days a week for tutoring in place of attending school. I must have read every Alzheimer's related non-fiction there was in that building after the year was done. But nothing can really prepare you for what it's actually like.

He called me the wrong name all the time--the name of one of his much older grandsons. That was the best of it. He loved taking walks, but he couldn't anymore as he'd often trail off his usual path or get completely lost. One time he went to the mall with my grandmother, and ended up getting driven home in a cop car after somebody saw him walking down the extremely busy street the mall was next to, weaving between the cars stopped at the lights. My grandma put locks on the inside of the doors after that. It's always a weird feeling to go back to her house and see that lock, key inserted, on the door as I'm leaving.

My dad took care of him. Or helped my grandmother every day with it at least. You could see the mental toll it took on him. He loved him more than his real father, who he seemed to despise but never stated why. And watching this man lose himself so quickly, forgetting who he was, becoming totally helpless and a burden, destroyed him. But he was alive, so somebody had to take care of him.

My grandfather died from Alzheimer's when I was still in high school. His body just caught up with him two years after that. My mother told me in the morning shortly before I went to my college courses, and as I sat in the shower thinking about it, all I could really think was that it was a relief. As I looked at his weird bloated face, like the mortician botched the embalming, and I saw my grandmother crying near his casket during the wake, all I could think was that I'm glad he's finally gone. Because that disease destroys your mind first, and everyone around you second, and then your body last.

In case people actually care about what he has to say about the matter after the Butler incident. Right or wrong, this is the natural by-product of having overly educated young minds with little-to-no real world experience get intellectually subjugated to this post-modernist, identity politics based, nonsense many espouse on campus.

As a fellow Columbia student, I support his right to free speech. While I don’t agree with his actions wholly, I don’t condemn him for them. He deserves a voice too. Whether or not we agree with him. I don’t believe him to be a Racist. Just severely socially-unaware and less than prudent in this situation. Further, I believe him to be a part of a growing population of brilliant young minds that don’t believe in “righting the wrongs of the past” by admitting they have “privilege” anymore than one of their peers. We’re ALL privileged to be at Columbia University, lest not forget that.

“This movement of inquiry must be directed towards humanization—the people’s historical vocation. The pursuit of full humanity, however, cannot be carried out in isolation or individualism, but only in fellowship and solidarity; therefore it cannot unfold in the antagonistic relations between oppressors and oppressed. No one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so. Attempting to be more human, individualistically, leads to ­having more, egotistically, a form of dehumanization. Not that it is not ­fundamental to have in order to be human. Precisely because it is necessary, some men’s having must not be allowed to constitute an obstacle to others’ having, must not consolidate the power of the ­former to crush the latter.”

Yeah, no way to know if there's water available at a Border Patrol station. Except, y'know, the people stationed there probably drink water pretty frequently.

&gt;Still a tragedy that was 100% avoidable by not bringing your kid on a desert expedition on foot with no water or food.

We don't know that it was avoidable. It's entirely possible the people in the caravan (including the father and his now-deceased daughter) were/are trying to escape certain death and/or grievous mistreatment. There are risks associated with this, of course, but have a little humanity, dude...

Yup, so that means don't bother. Oops, maybe we should wait for all the *facts* before judging border patrol here. You know, the guys who I have no reason to give the benefit of the doubt to, given their previous shitty behavior around migrants seeking asylum.

"e9vsfvq","""result that didn't go your way"" is a very loose, even disingenuous way to categorise the discontent from the remain half of the debate. From the remain side, it's very much an argument about improving the country as part of something bigger and working together to reap wider, longer-term benefits as a species rather than selfishly isolate ourselves on a tiny island and remove our stake in the wider world, to become an isolationist and suspicious nation unaware and intolerant of other cultures. Its very much *not* about an individual not getting their way. I think if we're ever going to have a sensible debate on the Brexit topic, people are going to have to accept that it's far more complex than people 'getting their way'. 

To be blunt, at no point in all of history has isolationism, separatist and 'us-vs-them' been a beneficial or positive stance to take with regards to cultures and societies. However it's always been a tempting way to scapegoat problems that an individual or small group may be facing. So leaders and people in power throughout history have frequently leveraged this idea, to blame our current issues on someone/something else and rally people around not in support of a positive agenda but a negative one. Brexit is one such example of this method of leadership.

What's key here is that of course there are valid arguments to criticise the management of the EU.  That's totally reasonable and no institution is perfect. However, if we play the objective ""how will textbooks view this event in history, in 100 years' time"" game we can see that the campaign arguments made in favour of leaving the EU (not what Steve said down at the pub, but the actual public media campaigns) were pretty much universally misleading, half-truths, actual lies, misrepresented facts or in some cases flagrant examples of racism or xenophobia. Very rarely if at all were genuine criticisms levied during the media campaigns at the time (and the lack of any coherent message was true on both sides! People did a dreadful job of forming an argument either way because frankly, nobody in the public eye understood in the slightest what they were talking about) The campaign manipulatively played to people's misgivings and fears and drummed up a swell of blame and regret with no thought for the ramifications.

If you take care to do some good research, it's possible to find statements, talks and lectures from the time of the vote campaign, on the fringes and edges of the media, where actual experts (not politicians or public figures) gave their informed views on what they thought might happen if the UK did/didn't leave. Top scientists, economists, lawyers, anthropologists, historians and academics concerned with matters of culture, fiscal policy, lawmaking, science and more. These examples of more informed discourse were extremely enlightening and what's more, they all say the same things with credible and informed reasoning. It's a terrible idea to leave/it will set us back culturally, scientifically, technologically and economically/it's ultimately a separation based on a nationwide dissatisfaction with a ruling elite and grass-roots economical problems/the arguments being used to espouse leaving are taking advantage of this dissatisfaction and manipulating a frustrated populace in ways they don't understand but they will argue for vehemently.

Ultimately it's one of the biggest blunders I can remember from recent history. I've got no personal stake in the result, it'll affect me a little but that's not what I care about. The cultural, scientific and wider implications of leaving the EU will be felt for decades, if not longer, and they aren't positive.

"e9jhh34","Given the state of negotiations and the attitudes of both the UK and EU the chances of both sides agreeing a deal and that deal getting passed by this parliament are slim to none, whereas no-deal is the default outcome at this point.


&gt; ""All of these nightmare scenarios are guaranteed"" - again, a high level of certainty. Who are your (credible) sources for that statement?

They’re guaranteed “if we leave the EU under those circumstances” referring to no deal.
There is simply no possibility of the UK not experiencing disruption to its food supply if we leave the EU without a deal, which will in turn lead to civil unrest.

&gt; Some degree of panic buying in April is possible in the scenario where predictions like yours are taken seriously.

I’m not sure what you mean here but panic buying is more than possible if predictions like mine come to pass. I don’t see how those predictions being taken seriously or not will affect things at that point though, I’m advocating for action before then.

&gt; I'm not saying that any of these scenarios are impossible, I'm saying that the level of certainty you're expressing points to a biased viewpoint that should be taken with a pinch of salt.

And I’m not saying no deal is 100% certain, just likely enough that it’s wise to be prepared for it.
And I agree people should take what both of us are saying with a pinch of salt and do their own research, that should always be the case.

&gt; Moreover, the laundry list of economic disasters being outlined in various places would occur only if the government did literally nothing to address them before the deadline.

The effects of Brexit would no doubt be far worse if the government had done nothing. I’m not saying they’ve done nothing to prepare, just that they simply aren’t capable of fully mitigating all these coming crises especially since they’ll all impact at once and the country’s ability to respond has been maimed by years of austerity.

&gt; •	⁠Queues at Dover? More likely tariff barriers.

Both, probably. The government is making preparations for gridlock at ports, one of the articles in my post described it.

&gt; •	⁠Shortage of nuclear material? Not in the short term, unless those needing the material are fools.

Do I even have to address this one? You kind of answered it yourself.

&gt; •	⁠Rationing? According to whom?

The optimists among us who trust the government to do what it did the last time we had severe food shortages rather than watch us fight over food.

&gt; •	⁠Failure of GPS? WHAT?! Being denied the position of decision-maker in Galileo and having GPS turn off are two very different things.

I’m pretty sure we’re getting cut off from Galileo altogether, not just the position of decision maker.
I’m admittedly not totally read up on this particular issue though so I could be wrong.

&gt; Go buy your tins of beans and your medical supplies. There's no harm in it.

There’s no harm in preparing, there is harm in being unprepared. 
If the worst comes to pass everyone who could’ve prepared but ignored the warnings will be competing for resources with those who didn’t have the ability to prepare. 
Brexit will hit the most vulnerable among us the hardest and we all have a responsibility to mitigate as much of the damage as we are able.

&gt;The odds of people actually drawing meaningful benefit from your advice is slim to none, and it scares people.

Hopefully I’ve already explained how the chances of this happening are far from slim.

Worst case scenario if you’re wrong: people are unaware and unprepared for the worst crisis this country has faced since World War 2.

George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this?

&gt; Let’s be clear about this: Jeff Zucker made a fortune creating Donald Trump at NBC; he made a fortune getting Trump elected with a billion dollars in free airtime; and he’s now making a fortune pretending to oppose Trump at CNN.'

Vox has declared [CNN is mainstreaming misinformation for Donald Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pS4x8hXQ5c), with their 'prioritization of drama and spectacle over serious truth telling'.

According to legendary news anchor Ted Koppel ‘[CNN’s Ratings Would Be in the Toilet Without Donald Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZOgnHUQ_P8)’

Jeff Zucker has now renewed [his contract as president of CNN Worldwide through 2020](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/jeff-zucker-renews-at-cnn-through-the-2020-election).

&gt; Ratings. Clicks. Audience. Say what you will about Trump as a human being or a potential leader of the free world, he has an ineffable ability to get attention. He has called himself a “ratings machine,” and in the world of TV, ratings equal profit.

&gt; “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,” Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS, said of the Trump phenomenon in March, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

&gt; “The money’s rolling in, and this is fun. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

&gt; Moonves’s ebullience makes it clear that ratings madness infects all of commercial TV, although, of course, particularly the cable-news channels.

&gt; None rolled out the welcome mat more eagerly than CNN, which has billed itself as the “most trusted name in news.” And unlike Fox, which is blatantly conservative, CNN pitches itself as nonpartisan. It’s supposed to be the down-the-middle alternative to Fox and, on the left, MSNBC.

Despite [the narrative pushed by Donald Trump, CNN, and a majority of the mainstream media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/26/trump-blasts-cnn-am-tweet-blaming-me-bombings/?utm_term=.fab862c01663)---a symbiotic relationship clearly exists. Attacks between these parties obscure the true mutually beneficial nature of their relationship.

According to the The New York Times: [CNN Had a Problem. Donald Trump Solved It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html)

&gt;But then along came a presidential candidate who was a human breaking-news event. Trump provided drama and conflict every time he opened his mouth. So too did his growing band of surrogates, who were paid by either the campaign or the network, and in one case both, to defend his statements. Indeed, it often seemed disconcertingly as though Trump had built his entire campaign around nothing so much as his singular ability to fill cable news’s endless demand for engaging content.  
&gt;  
&gt;Had Trump lost the election, CNN would probably have returned to its previously scheduled struggle for survival. Instead, it has become more central to the national conversation than at any point in the network’s history since the first gulf war. And the man who is presiding over this historic moment at CNN happens to be the same one who was in some part responsible for Donald Trump’s political career. It was Zucker who, as president of NBC Entertainment, broadcast “The Apprentice” at a time when Trump was little more than an overextended real estate promoter with a failing casino business. That show, more than anything, reversed Trump’s fortunes, recasting a local tabloid villain as the people’s prime-time billionaire. And it was Zucker who, as president of CNN, broadcast the procession of made-for-TV events — the always news-making interviews; the rallies; debates; the “major policy addresses” that never really were — that helped turn Trump into the Republican front-runner at a time when few others took his candidacy seriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;CNN was hardly the only news organization to provide saturation coverage of the Trump campaign. The media-measurement firm mediaQuant calculated that Trump received the equivalent of $5.8 billion in free media — known as “earned media,” as opposed to paid advertising — over the course of the election, $2.9 billion more than Hillary Clinton. Nor is CNN the only cable-news network that has benefited from Trump’s incarnation as a politician. MSNBC and Fox News each had a surge in ratings during the election that has shown no signs of slowing since then. Fox, the president’s preferred outlet, is coming off the best quarter in the history of 24-hour cable news. MSNBC, the network of the resistance, has been thriving, too, often even beating CNN during prime time.  
&gt;  
&gt;But CNN was the first major news organization to give Trump’s campaign prolonged and sustained attention. He was a regular guest in the network’s studios from the earliest days of the Republican primaries, often at Zucker’s suggestion. (For a while, according to the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Trump referred to Zucker as his “personal booker.”) When Trump preferred not to appear in person, he frequently called in. Nor did CNN ever miss an opportunity to broadcast a Trump rally or speech, building the suspense with live footage of an empty lectern and breathless chyrons: “DONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE.” Kalev Leetaru, a data scientist, using information obtained from the TV News Archive, calculated that CNN mentioned Trump’s name nearly eight times more frequently than that of the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz, during the primaries.

In the words of [Drew Magary](https://www.gq.com/story/cnn-jeff-zucker-thinks-this-is-a-game):

&gt; There you have it. We are reduced to living in a TV industry where the head of CNN feels compelled to defend, to the President’s power-hungry son-in-law, his practice of employing a handful of people who refuse to actively support racism and sexism. It's not hard to see the profound effect that Zucker has had on Trump, and vice versa. Both men love ratings. Both men love attention. Both men love the art of spectacle, even when it's not backed by substance. Zucker treats the fate of the country like it's disposable entertainment, and Donald Trump does the same, and that is why nothing works.

Douglas: 

&gt;At age 76 on December 31, 1974, while on vacation with his wife Cathleen in the Bahamas, Douglas suffered a debilitating stroke in the right hemisphere of his brain. 

[...] 

&gt;At the urging of Fortas, Douglas finally retired on November 12, 1975, after 36 years of service.

[...]

&gt;Douglas's formal resignation was submitted, as required by Federal protocols, to his long-time political nemesis, then-President Gerald Ford. In his response, Ford put aside previous differences, and paid tribute to the retiring justice, writing:

&gt;May I express on behalf of all our countrymen this nation's great gratitude for your more than thirty-six years as a member of the Supreme Court. Your distinguished years of service are unequaled in all the history of the Court.

[...]

&gt;Douglas maintained that he could assume judicial senior status on the Court, and attempted to continue serving in that capacity, according to authors Woodward and Armstrong, and refused to accept his retirement, trying to participate in the Court's cases well into 1976, after John Paul Stevens had taken his former seat.[47] Douglas reacted with outrage when, returning to his old chambers, he discovered that his clerks had been reassigned to Stevens, and when he tried to file opinions in cases whose arguments he had heard before his retirement, Chief Justice Warren Burger ordered all justices, clerks, and other staff members to refuse help to Douglas in those efforts. When Douglas tried in March 1976 to hear arguments in a capital-punishment case, Gregg v. Georgia, the nine sitting justices signed a formal letter informing him that his retirement had ended his official duties on the court. Only then did Douglas withdraw from Supreme Court business.[48] One commentator has attributed some of his behavior after his stroke to anosognosia, a neuropsychological presentation which leads an affected person to be unaware and unable to acknowledge disease in himself. It often results in defects in reasoning, decision making, emotions, and feeling.[49]",1539120490,"48] one commentator has attributed some of his behavior after his stroke to anosognosia, a neuropsychological presentation which leads an affected person to be unaware and unable to acknowledge disease in himself.","unaware and unable","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unable","unable",NA,NA,1

Then do it. Do the right thing. Save countless of lives and our future.

&gt;As soon as the left wing stops trying to literally codify into law discrimination against me and stops trying to needlessly take my property I'll consider it.

Citation needed.

Left wing legislation opposes discrimination, so that's just not a thing. 

Taxes (I believe that's what you are trying to refer to) are necessary and good. You paying taxes helps your society grow and makes your life better as a consequence. You know, society, the thing you used to get literally every single privilege you have and enabled your existence and everything you ever achieved? The thing you would be absolutely nothing without and without which your probably wouldn't be alive? Yeah, that thing. You paying a little bit of your income and wealth as taxes make it better. Make the lives of everyone better. Don't know why this conversation needs to be had in the 21st century. How unaware and entitled does someone need to be to not understand his place in society and the concept of taxes? You get to enjoy all the stuff your taxes pay for. Better streets, better infrastructure, cheaper transport, cleaner environment, smarter people, happier people, healthier people, A LOT less crime, etc. 

Socioeconomic equality is the single most important factor for the socioeconomic wellbeing of people. Except you are one of the top 0.1% of Americans, voting for right wing politics will make your life worse. And if you are one of the top 0.1%: Great! Vote Republican! (Although your grandchildren will definitely be worse off, and you are just being a massively narcissistic cunt who doesn't even give a shit about his own offspring at that point.) But if you are one of the 99.9%, you shouldn't. Rich republicans want to be kings and queens of a garbage dump rather than being average people in a well-kept garden. Non-rich republicans are the ones begging for scraps from the job creators.



By the way: If you are not self-employed (i.e. are part of the vast majority of people voting Republican) and want to take more money home, you should vote for *socialist* politics. In a socialist economy, the people who work get the money. Not the ""job creator"" parasites not doing any actual work. That's how you get more money: Getting paid more for your labour. Not by refusing to pay your dues to the society that enables your life.

**More importantly**: How are these excuses to vote for right wing politics? These are unimportant topics compared to what we are talking about. People are dying. The environment we all live in is being destroyed.  

Right wing politics is literally killing you and making your life worse. Always. You are literally being poisoned by polluted air as we speak and the effects of harmful policies reduce your quality of life in every way I can think of. Anything you save in taxes, you probably lose due to increased cost of living, higher health care costs, higher retirement costs, etc. anyway while tens of millions of people have a worse life and the only ones to benefit are the ultra-rich.

I mean, maybe you really don't get it:   
***Would you support a party that says ""We will reduce your taxes, but every single day our special police force will drag 1000 randomly selected Americans (primarily young children and old people) out of their homes and shoot them, then let the bodies lie there for the relatives to clean up.""?***   

The Republicans kill more people and cause more suffering and cost to relatives than that. This is not a joke. This is not an exaggeration. By voting Republican you are voting for worse than what was just described. It is unethical to vote for the Republican Party or any other right wing party. We need strict environmental regulations, we need high environmental taxes, we need well-funded public education financed by all citizens, we need well-funded universal health care financed by all citizens. There is no other reasonable way (although you can feel free to propose one). Not doing so literally kills people.

Teacher liked to expand our horizons and whatnot, so we had a segment on plays and improv. He split us up into groups of 4 and we had like - 10m (probably less) to come up with the basic outline of a story involving 2 known heroes and villains.

Back then, I was a very insecure, self-conscious, shy kid. But I was aware of it and trying to overcome it and all. By sheer chance, I got paired with the three weirdest kids in class. One guy - we'll call him Tom - who was this tall lanky guy who was just loud, socially unaware, and impulsive. There was - who we'll call - Ashley, a short, stout, spray-tanned girl with much the same personality quirks as Tom. And finally, there was Nativa, a very, very quite girl I knew from elementary school.

So I do my best to try to push our team to think of something. Tom decides he'll be superman. Ashley and Nativa agree that some rando characters from mean girls will do. And I can't think of diddly squat, so I pick Darth vader. We decide to have Superman and Vader fight, while the two others ... commentate? Cheer? I don't know.

So I try kind of pushing them to come up with something more - but that's it. That's all they want to do and they're satisfied. They've started having fun with their ""free time.""

&amp;#x200B;

So we start. My worst nightmares come true. Every other group has these detailed stories complete with conclusions, dialog, twists... there was even an entire trial against none other than - *Darth Vader.* Even my character was already taken.

We get up there and announce our characters. I'm just kind of holding a calculator case to my face pretending to have a mask. Our teacher gives us the go ahead and Tom puts up his dukes. He bounces up and down on his feet like an all-too ready boxer. I pretend to put up my invisible lightsaber. He bounces his way over and basically *runs me over.*

I wasn't expecting it and Tom is a tall dude, so I topple over and frantically try to stay in character by screeching ""I AM YOUR FATHERR""

I knocked some desks to the side and fell to the ground. All the while, Ashley and Nativa are just *standing there*. Never doing or saying *anything*.

My teacher ends the fiasco with ""...We have a lot of work to do.""

I wouldn't have minded laughter. Laughing at me, laughing at the situation - any of that would have been fine. Even an awkward ""this is weird"" kind of laugh. But no, instead I was met with a wall of awkward silence from the class as we finished.

"e6sgcyq","Hello,

I know exactly what you mean. It’s like someone comes and takes over your body and speech and talks incessantly or has no control or filter. 

In fact this happened to me last weekend. I was having a nice peaceful day and doing a great job of being as centered as I could. We then met some people for lunch - and I immediately started this behavior. 

It was like I was trying to stop and couldn’t and later on my husband was confused too. Why all of a sudden the gabbing and inability to stop and interrupting and on and on. 

I didn’t get it. 

Reading this today makes me get it. We are triggered subconsciously so so often, and subconscious by definition is out of my awareness. In my story, I was not acting this way and then I was. Sometimes I act like this the whole day. It all depends. I’m sure for you too. 

But I realize in that example one thing- this is a very sensitive time. I must protect my energy and who I interact with. There were 2 people at lunch that I don’t know very well but are friends with someone who was a trigger to me over 10 years ago. 

Perhaps I didn’t realize that their presence did not feel safe. Conversation was easy and fun and centered around the city we were in. But our subconscious knows better. Being there in the presence of those people probably brought me back to a time in which I was much more emotionally labile, unaware, and vulnerable. Thus now I manifest this fear and anxiety as dysregulation of speech and emotion. 
Others may shut down completely. We all have our ways. Given that I am an extrovert my anxiety manifests this way often- outwardly. Inability to stop over speaking. 

Maybe this can help you? See above response as well. I believe this aspect is like all else with healing. Awareness first and then practice.

Anyway, I guarantee you they didn’t profit off of you in any way unless they scheduled you out for treatment.

These “deals” exist to get patients in the door. Works well for the office if the patient needs deep cleaning and/or lots of restorative work. 

It sounds like a good deal in your case, though. Doesn’t seem like they’ll be retaining you as a patient, either. 

Where I work, a regular cleaning is around $80. And that doesn’t even include the xrays and comprehensive exam. 

And if you have heavy tartar buildup and periodontitis(many people do and are unaware and uninformed), a deep cleaning with local anesthetic is around $1,000. It’s usually done by us hygienists and takes much longer than a regular cleaning. This is how it goes in my office usually: After exam and xrays and charting/assessment is done, a patient who is diagnosed with perio usually schedules a deep cleaning another day after all that info is submitted to insurance for verification. Then, when you come back, it’ll take me a minimum of 2 hours to remove dental calculus(tartar) from the surfaces of the teeth/roots. Patients who have a deep cleaning are put on maintenance every 3-4 months. Those cleanings take between 45 minutes and an hour and are less intense depending on how the patient takes care of their teeth at home. Anyway, there’s a whole process of stuff going on behind the scenes that patients don’t understand. We still have patients to this day that demand a “cleaning only” without xrays/exam and that cannot happen. Procedures are in place that must be followed. The dentist’s license is on the line and mine is as well. However, we take the time to explain why and how things work the way they work. 

Dental offices wouldn’t survive if $50 was the typical cost for xrays, exam and a thorough cleaning. 

But I understand your frustration. The best advice I can give you is to ask your friends/family members if they can direct you to a reputable dentist they’ve known for a while.

"e6h6hio","Okay, but then I don't understand your argument against abortion.

If you want to argue against abortion, why not argue against the reasons people consider it acceptable?

Your method, if I understand it, would break down like this:

1) for some reasons, some people consider abortion acceptable.

2) fetuses are not aware of what is happening and are useless 

3) if you justify the killing of fetuses for any reason, you must also justify the killing of everything that doesn't understand what is happening and is useless.

4) 1 year olds are unaware and useless

5) therefore, if you accept abortion you should accept the killing of 1 year olds


There are a number of problems there, but the biggest one is step 3.

For the similarities between 1 year olds and fetuses to require the connection you imply, those similarities should connect up with the unspecified reasons in step 1, and you haven't done that.

"e56lmoy","Well your idea of lucid dreams in particular being possibly selected against is really making me think about what purpose dreams might serve.

I've thought for a while that dreams must have some evolutionary benefit - Not all parts of sleep are dreams, so the body *can* give us entirely dreamless sleep if it was beneficial, but it doesn't. Now are what we perceive as dreams just epiphenomena of brain chemistry doing its thing as we sleep? Or do they in themselves actually serve a real purpose, (You've probably heard theories about how they may help simulate possible waking experiences)?

Well your theory of lucid dreams possibly being detrimental has altered this a bit for me. If we can assume that the *type* of dream is actually selected for/against (or at least was at some point during humanity's past), then this might actually help rule out dreams as an epiphenomena.

Basically what I'm saying is, if we do actually discover that lucid dreams give a certain evolutionary detriment/benefit than it can be easier for us to assume that dreams are actually intended functions of parts of sleep and serve some kind of behavioural benefit as well as physical (as the brain rests).

As a tangent, I also like the implication that evolution has selected for us to be totally unaware and non-conscious for some parts of our existence (dreamless sleep).

On dream characters - they're certainly diverse to me, not a single monolith like you might expect for poorly simulated abstracts of characters. I wonder if they're created by the brain by amalgamating certain memories of certain people/personality traits. Some do seem more intelligent than others to me yeah, is this a consequence of our brains giving them more attention/""processing power"" or maybe something to do with our expectations? It's a really interesting thought considering everyone seems to have different experiences with DCs (I haven't met any that actively try to trick me yet as you seem to), our dreams seem like fascinating worlds and they seem to be taken for granted and don't get nearly enough attention imo.",1535755221,"as a tangent, i also like the implication that evolution has selected for us to be totally unaware and non-conscious for some parts of our existence (dreamless sleep).","unaware and non","unaware","and",FALSE,"totally unaware and non","non","totally",NA,1

The imagery is excessively used by racists, in and outside of the context of idioms. But, you are correct, by far not exclusively in that way.

So from that clarification while it is faulty to project from such a term to racism automatically, given in the context it is also more than ""just a gaffe"" that this imagery is chosen.

Veil Thinning
Published on Aug 17, 2018
WE ARE their sworn enemy. Their is one last pure person that the demons must eliminate before they conquer this world and the entire universe. Luciferians from all around the globe, Europe, US, Russia, China, India and the locals and all the followers of the Antichrist have been looking for HIM 4 the past 3 years. I was caught unaware and unprepared as they are the master of deceptions. We can die many times in a dimension (Dying is only term of mankind who live in this physical world). The nearest words I can use is my live stall to the lowest level - like a battery that has dried out almost totally. The devil conquered this universe for 2 month roughly. THIS IS WHY THE CLOUDS everywhere- manifested themselves as clouds that can be seen around the world by those who pay attention. All mankind, animals and trees and man were confused. Some died unable to bare the pain n died. . The detail is too much to describe - . The long battle of this good vs evil took place with them winning at first by Lucifer and  followers who is now care for the Antichrist hidden from mankind. 2. The managed to dig up from the ground and enter our physical world and mingle around with mankind for a while.  MY VIDEOS SHOW ALL..They have no physical body yet and just able to manifest themselves as clouds. orbs and shadows. They will have physical body latter including the whole universe (depending if they win this war) 3.  - The heaven would belong to him and those souls who have died will be forever enslaved. Mankind will exchange place, they will stay in the underworld dimension full of torture, civilizations ends. No grand children for this era of mankind. Non. Nothing 4. They place the spirit of all kinds of reptilian being ( mostly snakes, chrocs and iguanas on the back of every human soul before entering and manipulating their brain, conquered and enslave them before killing them - End of our civilization. 5. They started by offering you to a journey (depending what you are obsessed at) 6. They enter you brain, set up series of dramas, lock and codify them so that you can not do anything. You must be able to decode those memory lock during the battle. You are the main actor and always 
losing the battle against them all r  deceptions. Once u r caught in dreams, all of them are not true because they manipulate your brain and memory. U are  following rules and agenda... all deceptions. Be your pure self as human, keep on doing good things. Leave all sinful acts. ALMOST ALL MANKIND HAVE BEEN DECEIVED NOW. 7. They, the Antichrist teams, use a very advance state of the art technologies. TV in your living room, Mobile Phones are use to enter one's eyes, the demon will, from your eyes enter your heart and stay there. They then enter the brain of mankind, juggle it, set up all kind of dramas in those dreams and manipulate your brain and used all your memories,  on sight. 8. They disguised themselves as Gray, UFO Beings, Annanuki, Deity and all false and perceived so called "" gods "" worshiped by current mankind around the world, you kids, wife, parents, grandparents, friends, preachers, Pope, Padre, Cleric, Imam and you name it - just to deceive you until you agree that they are goddisguise themselves as you. 9. Use of high speed supercomputer with advance algorithm and make use of the brain of scientist to steal knowledge, science and human technology all  Strategies keep on changing multi front battles.. Brain juggling causing the so called Mandela Effect due to some memory overlapping each other as a result of those evil interventions. . Good deeds helps to brighten up the other side.  The real sun damaged and temporarily hidden somewhere low in a ravine between two mountains unknown to mankind (True Messiah) vs evil Antichrist in the unseen world starting end of last year. In this parallel universe, the Antichrist and his armies have successfully conquered the sun and the entire universe but The Purest One was able to recaptured it. It is under rehabilitation . The sun will turn brilliant again soon.  .  Devil entities has escaped during the war and manifested themselves in this physical reality taking their form as clouds seen by peoples everywhere. The clouds represent whats is going on in the heaven. You can feel the sorrow of man, animal and trees.The reptilians' scales forms and evil figures are still covering most of the sky in the west but has subsided in the East (Asia). S Mankind confuse tooCERN scientist fail to get what they look for and switched to be with the luciferians. T. The sea beings are the most evil one. Got many legs and almost 100 feet high for some of them. Those beings come from land, sky and sea. Those with rocks on their chest is the cruelest one. The US will be the most effected one.

"e4iwsdp","I just watched this yesterday, and I have to say, this its a pretty bad movie IMO.




Everyone says the twist was the best part. And yes, it is unexpected, but only because the plot makes no sense, so there is no way of ""guessing"". 






**SPOILERS AHEAD. BEWARE.**


**Some plot holes I have found:**



[Let's start with the war. Why would you send the army to ""turn off"" some robots. I mean, it makes no sense to the goverments of the whole world to send the army to shot robots in their working places, amidst civilians, fathers and children, CEOs and Politicians, anyone could have been wounded.](#spoiler)


[Instead, they should have call the robots for maintenance, or to clean an empty yard, and shot them from an elevated position, with ranged weapons. Not like they do in the movie, were they go with assault rifles just to fight melee](#spoiler)


[Also, why shot them to turn them off, they should have  a switch or something... or just reprogram them. They must have need for a firmeware/software update, or a patch download at some point.](#spoiler)



[Also, there is a point in the movie where a bounch of people is asking for help in the rooftop, and a spaceship just blow up the building.... What was the point on having your men going room by room killing robots, if you can just blow the whole building?](#spoiler)

[when the humans first enter peter's building, they look like a swat team, but then they fight separately. Israel Broussard character (the soldier) beats a barricaded door for half an hour before shoting, and then its revealed he can just go through a thick wall like its made of paper....  just... what's the point? Also, he could have talked to the robot on the other side, and tell him he was a neighbour who needed help. There is no way of knowing (at first glance) a robot from a human, beside the spacesuit.](#spoiler)


[Then, the human has his weapon stolen (And hacked!) and is shown to have a tracking device on it... like, Why not to call an airstrike on its position?](#spoiler)



[also, the humans could have just throw an EMP bomb in each city, before landing. It would have made everything really easy. But I guess there would have been no movie](#spoiler)


[I also don't get how the humans even lost the planet. Like... even if the robots are much stronger, and get kill some soldiers and steal their weapons... The humans have an organized army, navy, airforce... spaceships! I get that the robots probably outnumber humans, but still, just shot them from afar.](#spoiler)


[And how are this robots free from the 3 laws of robotic? I understand this is not in the ""Asimov universe"", but still... At least the first law should be pretty obvious: ""*Do not harm a human*""](#spoiler)



[Also, I think this movie is really lacking from a VIKI, from ""I, Robot"". Specially since the movie is just ""I, Robot"" if the robots won the first round. in the way this film is presented, there is no way the robots will win. With a central AI orchestating things from behind, it may be more plausible](#spoiler)



[I also don't understand the logic that, the whole army of the earth wasn't able to defeat the robots in the first war, when it was in the peak of its power, in a joint operation, by surprise, and against unaware and unarmed robots,  but then 50 years later, they hope succeed on a first try against the same robots than now had time to build defenses, prepare a plan, arm its population, etc (but yet, for some reason are still unarmed and unaware)](#spoiler)


[the human soldier even say they didn't know if the atmosphere was still breathable, implying that, because the robots don't need air, they could have poluted it as a  defense. And it's true.](#spoiler)



[Even more, taking the last point in consideration, if the robots resisted the initial ""deactivation"" process, and showed a will to exist, and humans had the capability to make a mass Exodus to Mars, they could have offered to take the robots to whatever planet they like.... Since they don't really need anything. Nor shelter, nor air, food or water, and their bateries seem capable of last for centuries without recharging. and both ""races"" get to live in peace](#spoiler)



[And what's the point of having your memory wiped? there you realize its everything made for the plot twist to happen. That's the only reason for each character decision. Even if the robots were suffering because of thos memories, just erase the gory parts... what's the point of not knowing even that they are not humans? Also, data doesn't work like that. If I erase a file form my computert, it doesn't get recovered. I don't found randomply parts of my file while playing a game or something. And turning it off and on doesn't recover my files like that.](#spoiler)



[As a last point, this movie fails at being dramatic after the plot twist is revealed. Your wife isn't dying... why a felow robot even says ""There is nothing more we can do"" (and he **did** know they were robots, as the diagnostic tool was shown to be an electric device"") just grab her and give her new batteries later. It makes no sense. or even more, take it's HDD and plug it in somewere else later. The train could have escaped with just 1 robot, with the ""brain"" from everybody inside a pendrive, everything is plotdriven and makes no sense](#spoiler)



In summary, this movie is bad and everything happen so the plot twist can happen. Even more, everithing is **forced** so that the plot twist can happen. Most characters make bad decisions so that the ""mistery"" can be kept a little longer. It could have been a good movie. The original Idea from the plot is good, but it's like the writer did not think the plot not even for a minute.

They are afraid you'll read about Hillary Clinton promoting Trump's campaign to distract from the rise in Sander's popularity and her email investigation. (It's from April 2015 - two weeks after she announced running for president, not ""after she was mathematically the winner"")

""[Here is one of those supposed unimportant emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120) And it's not illegal to look at. [Despite what CNN says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A).[backup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTiAf8fp8)

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

There is an active effort to contain news about the Podesta emails. It continues to be met w/ ridicule and mocking.

The DNC establishment thinks they can wait out the storm and will not have to change away from failed policies and dirty trick politics.

Go into any current event relating to Trump and see how far you have to go to see the ""But her emails..."".

They've already sold the meme at this point, and part of the purpose is to confuse you over the fact there are actually *3 separate email stories at play*.

**Email story 2)** [DNC email leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) (blamed on Russia, most likely upset staffers from sabotaging Sanders)

The Washington Post reported
&gt; Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. 

**Email story 3)** John Podesta's personal emails [(Hillary's campaign chair who had his account accessed from a phishing scam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails) *These are emails which include proof of media collusion, sabotaging Sanders, and more* 

The Podesta emails are also the emails involved in the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which I suspect is meant to delegitimize the other scandals.

"e36sikh","&gt;Except that’s a grossly simplistic viewpoint. Many people are telling you they’re infected but not infectious. Many people telling you they’re negative are positive and don’t know it. And yeah, somewhere in the mix also are people who lie. The pivotal question is whether people are more likely to lie and claim they’re “infected but not infectious” than they are to lie about being negative. This is where the situation gets bizarre, because most people would assume the liar would just go for the most socially privileged status, not the one whose safety remains in doubt even after endorsement by most major public health organizations.

&gt;I don’t have all day to haul out the statistics and break down the variables, so take my word or don’t. Nationally, 60% of positive people who know their status are undetectable. That figure is universally acknowledged to be much, much, much higher for gay men who contracted the virus from sex. This is common sense as the rest of the equation consists significantly of IV drug users and sex workers whom you would reasonably expect to have more struggles with adherence. Exact figures aren’t available as to the specific percent of Poz gay guys who are actually undetectable, but I’d easily wager it to be north of 90% a year after diagnosis.

So I did crunch the numbers, for the UK (where I live). Among 1000 random gay men, there are 60 who are infected with HIV but are virtually suppressed, 7 who are infected and aware but are infectious, 10 who are infectious and unaware, and 923 who are simply not infected.

If I sleep with a random guy out of those 1000, there's a 7.7% chance he's infectious.

If I sleep with a random guy who says he's not infected, there's a 1.7% chance he's infectious.

If I sleep with a random guy who says he's infected, there's a 10.4% chance he's infectious.

Frankly that 1.7% chance is too high for me, which is why I don't sleep around, and 10.4% is certainly an unacceptable risk. If an infected person assures me their viral load is undetectable, I'm not going to trust them short of documented bloodwork.

But all of this is just commentary - at the end of the day, taking reasonable precautions for your personal health is not serophobia, because it doesn't involve intense dislike or hatred towards the infected.",1532790490,"among 1000 random gay men, there are 60 who are infected with hiv but are virtually suppressed, 7 who are infected and aware but are infectious, 10 who are infectious and unaware, and 923 who are simply not infected.","infectious and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"infectious and unaware","infectious",NA,NA,0

Nothing that’s been released yet. 

There are 31 indictments and 6 guilty pleas. 

Not including the newest one

Be real with me here. Are you aware of the 31 indictments and 6 guilty pleas? Are you aware that he can’t legally borrow money in the US and can only borrow money from Russian banks directly linked to Putin? Are you aware that Every step of the way he has been involved with Russian Connections. Are you aware that Russia is the ONLY country Trump has not played “hardball” with. The only one he has not criticized for their trade deficits with the US. He’s picked a fight with every nation but Russia. Are you aware that the first time Trump switched to a Zero Sum game strategy for foreign policy was when he met with a Russian Ambassador in 87. In fact after that meeting he made a huge political campaign to dismantle the UN and other alliances opposed to Russia.

2.  American law says that have to do so at proper locations (port of entry; not get caught crossing illegally then claim asylum). I don't have the figures, but iirc a *majority* of these people cannot claim asylum because they didn't do so according to the law, hence the issue. Regardless, the ones that did don't qualify, because International law requires you to claim asylum in the first safe country you enter. Mexico is the filter. There is nothing happening in Mexico that would qualify any Mexican citizen for asylum in the United States. Anyone not of Mexican citizenship broke the International law by passing through Mexico to try to enter the U.S. instead of claiming asylum in Mexico (likely the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th safe country they illegally entered to *try* to get to the U.S.). Literally none of these people qualify for asylum based on U.S. law and International law. Not one.  

3a. There are no anti-LGBT laws from Dems because the Dems use all these feel good bullshit laws to keep their voters on the Democrat plantation. Better question, why do the Dems spend so much time on all this emotional bullshit but can't manage an economy, or jobs, or good deals, or unemployment? You know, the shit that *actually* matters? Answer: [Because Democrats want to create an unaware and compliant citizenry.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599) (This is an email from Bill Ivey, the National Chairman of the Arts to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, discussing campaign strategies. Read the last three lines of the first paragraph.) They want them dependent upon them (DNC/Dem party) and beholden to them. How does this not piss you off and wake you up? It terrified me when I read it after it leaked. They are literally talking about hiding information from the public (unaware), and controlling them (compliant), and that their inability to do either would, and I quote, ""a problem"". You're comfortable with this? 

3b. If you are so naive to assume #WalkAway is Russian bots I really can't help you. Hell, you may be right. But you're going to look really stupid in November (and 2020 when Trump wins 48 states) if it was legit and you did nothing to talk to those people to figure out how your party could change to keep them or get them back? How about a thought experiment? Let's say you're right; they're all Russian bots. There's no movement. It's fake, nothing happens. Dems can keep doing what they're doing. No need to talk to anyone. Nothing changes. Whatever happens in November and 2020 is what would have happened regardless, right? Now, let's for the sake of this thought experiment assume you were wrong. #WalkAway is real, and all those voices are leaving the Democrat party in droves. Did you try to talk to them to change their mind? Did you try to understand them and what you could do to bring them back? Nope, you (and I say you as being the left in general, not you specifically) reacted as the left always does. You call them liars, Russians, bots, you shame them, demean them...and in this hypothetical they're real, so all you've managed to do is to reaffirm why they're leaving, and more importantly, why you'll never get them back. It's a lose lose for Democrats if you think about it. They're either (a) Russian bots and nothing really changes, or (b) they are legitimate former party members sick of the direction the Democrat party is headed and sick of being on the Democrat plantation, and in which case, you should be terrified because there are millions of them. If they're real, the Democrat party can't survive this movement, and this is the evidence to me that suggest they're real, because otherwise the Democrat party wouldn't be trying to blame Russians for it. If they weren't real, there wouldn't be such a hard push to disprove it, or misdirect the public about its legitimacy. Think about it.

"e1xjfs8","I find MD to give me the strongest sense of this, I think because it makes me willing and able to behold it... it's like a mixture of pity / empathy /sadness and wonderment at the human condition.

Particularly gripping is to empathize with the mind of someone who acts out and is then humiliated.

I remember a story I was told at a party about someone in some social setting, perhaps a party (I forget or perhaps never heard the details) who disappeared for a while, only to be discovered in the child's bedroom, undertaking some act of molestation on account of alcoholic intoxication, a radical departure from their workaday personality. I remember trying to put myself into that person's mind, what would compel them, what they must feel about themselves to face the social consequences, and so forth.

I think in this situation, the child in question had been unaware and unharmed, so I was freer to consider the perpetrator's mind in isolation and dispensing for the time being with preconceived notions of good and evil thanks to the MD. I was filled with an incredible remorse and empathy for this person and the notion that we're all unwitting and unwilling demons underneath.

It's easy to write off acts like this as 'acts of evil', premeditated, calculating, and perpetrated in full gnosis of (and disregard for) the enormity and consequences and so forth, because in doing so we needn't inspect our own hearts to see if anything similar might lurk there.

In that moment, I felt I understood it all – and it relates to your observations of emotional trauma. What emotional life must it have been to culminate in that moment. Social suicide; utterly. It was a heavy, heavy notion to behold. The breadth and scope of what was lost – a lifetime spent preserving face and conceding to social norms squandered in an instant.

But, that and other experiences really taught me something. I feel I can say nowadays that I can genuinely empathize with the 'evil' among us.

I've never hurt someone in this particular way, and I've never injured someone since schoolyard battles, but I'm very certain that I'd probably done far worse with my words. I used to be a very angry, but articulate, person; and, whence my hackles were raised, I didn't think twice about delivering the most excoriating criticisms. I even delighted that my knowledge of human psychology allowed me to be so individually hurtful, with such lasting effect.

I eventually realized that my harmful intentions were actually against myself, so that I might appear congruently, to myself, next to such a disfigured self image.

Since that time, I've used my facility with language to uplift, rather than destroy, and I'm infinitely grateful I came to that realization in (a little) less than half a lifetime.

However, when you say traps aren't working, I assume you mean ant bait stations. (Usually a packet of clear gel.) They are not designed to trap, they are more like a buffet and the idea is that the ants will take the bait home and share it. Unfortunately if you have used OTC (repellent) pesticide, it will taint the bait, or taint the pheromone trail that lead all the other ants to it, which defeats the purpose.

If it were I, I would scrub everything down with simple soapy water and let it dry. Put out new bait stations where you see activity indoors and just let the scouts leave a new pheromone trail to the stations and let the ant super highway form. They will take it back to the nest and you will kill more in the long run.

"e0duugh","**Character Rankings**

*Disclaimer: These are my opinions. You may not agree with them, and that’s ok! These rankings are in no way objective and are solely from the view of 1 watcher. I am simply offering my opinion on the season.*

**One World**


**Season Ranking: 36/36**

**Cast Average**: 466.06

18: **Colton Cumbie 1.0** - Colton, in a span of only 6 episodes, was able to be racist, classist, and generally despicable during One World. He spends his time solely with the girls, then is somehow in power, gets his entire tribe (including Bill!) to throw immunity away to vote Bill out because Colton is an aforementioned racist and classist person, but don’t worry he has a black housemaid so everything is ok! He then bonds more with Alicia during the postswap by making fun of Christina for being Asian. He is then anticlimactically medevaced instead of getting the downfall he so desperately deserves after his insanely negative edit, killing both his character and the season. Awful.

Overall Ranking: 646/653

17: **Alicia Rosa** - Does plenty of stuff that is just as bad as Colton does, such as the mentioned above mocking of Christina for being Asian, or that time where she compared Christina to a special-ed kid even though she was a special-ed teacher at the time, which is just such a great look. Also she has one of the most laughably unaware and egomaniacal jury speeches this side of David, funny that they ended up hooking up, they fit perfectly together!

Overall Ranking: 639/653

16: **Tarzan Smith** - Lucky for him the two below him are some of the worst characters Survivor has ever produced, because if he was on literally *any other season*, Tarzan would be recognized for just how awful of a character he is. He feels only a shade less forced than Phillip, which isn’t a good thing, he does visually repugnant things like walk around in what is basically a bikini bottom, which is fucking disgusting, and he says things that are morally repugnant, such as the time he claimed racism wasn’t real because at the time we had a black president. Oh but he’s funny though hahahahahahahaha (spoiler: he’s not).

Overall Ranking: 637/653

15: **Kat Edorsson 1.0** - Delusional characters can be funny. Unaware people make some of the best moments in the show. Kat is not this. Kat is so clearly playing up her own delusions to try and make herself look dumber, and it is not funny. Not knowing that a BLT has bacon in it? Not buying it for a fucking second. Her family visit is one of the hardest I’ve ever cringed at watching Survivor. Ever.

Overall Ranking: 611/653

14: **Leif Manson** - Such awful stunt casting it hurts me to even write about how he was stunt casting. He was only cast because of his size and does nothing worth a damn during his small time on screen. He is notable for genuinely being the 2nd worst casting choice in the history of the show.

Overall Ranking: 587/653

13: **Nina Acosta** - She called Kat an idiot (which isn’t false at all), and started some fights. That’s all I can remember. 

Overall Ranking: 580/653

12: **Matt Quinlan** - Bland, boring alpha male who gives Colton power in the game because he can’t count.

Overall Ranking: 577/653

11: **Jay Byars** - Is genuinely one of the most boring and bland people ever cast, and this is on One World! He ruins the sole attempt of a coup on Kim by squealing like a pleasure pig as soon as Troyzan comes up with a halfway competent plan.

Overall Ranking: 566/653

10: **Troyzan Robertson 1.0** - He brings something, but the problem is most of the time that something is generic and/or boring. I don’t like generic underdogs, and Troyzan is just that in the “THIS IS MY ISLAND!!!!” episode, where he also gets an ungodly amount of screentime for no real reason at all (fun fact Troyzan in the This is My Island episode gets 14 confessionals, which equals his total confessional number for GC).

Overall Ranking: 505/653

9: **Monica Culpepper 1.0** - The first iteration of our Neat Lady is fine. She doesn’t do anything wrong nor does she do anything spectacular, but she is a nice older lady who works hard which is seriously helpful on NuManono with bottom-tier shit like Tarzan, Leif, Colton, and Alicia on her tribe.

Overall Ranking: 449/653

8: **Bill Posley** - He’s a pretty funny guy, who knows how to use some good self-deprecating humor (or so it seems), early on. But then his content is literally 100% related to Colton being a bigot, so he can’t actually rank high on my rankings, even if I have a bunch of respect for him and feel bad for how his experience turned out.

Overall Ranking: 432/653

7: **Kourtney Moon** - She was the best casting choice on the season and went out during the first challenge due to an injury. Speaks to the quality of OW. I liked her aesthetic though and think she had some stuff going on.

Overall Ranking: 427/653

6: **Kim Spradlin** - She is so good at the game of Survivor she single handedly ruins a season. Kim may be a great player, but boy, as a TV character, she is not great. Kim is just boring and mostly dull, but she has her moments, like the pig slaughter or the idol in her crotch. Otherwise a very mediocre character at the very best because she’s just so boring.

Overall Ranking: 380/653

5: **Michael Jefferson** He’s ok? He just has some weirdly odd or quirky yet funny moments that kinda just happen in the background away from the action. Like him stealing from the girls supplies at the opening rush when it was totally unnecessary, just weird shit that you kinda just tilt your head at in genuine surprise, which on a shitty season like OW will get you this high.

Overall Ranking: 365/653

4: **Christina Cha** - Is laughably bad at Survivor. She is so bad at Survivor it is comical, and not in a played-up, forced way like Kat. She is genuinely an awful player. She basically quits at F4, and that always makes me crack a smile, plus she brings out some really good stuff from Sabrina. Also she stays likable in the face of Colton and Alicia so that helps as well.

Overall Ranking: 319/653

3: **Chelsea Meissner** - I like her. She has some (good) spunk and attitude and that can’t be overstated on such a terrible season. She has some fun moments like her getting on Tarzan over plastic surgery (anyone getting on Tarzan is a positive to me), or when she talks about liking Jay and Troy, but liking money more. It’s the only time I laughed while watching One World, and yes I kept track of that.

Overall Ranking: 252/653

2: **Jonas Otsuji** - He’s one of the few charismatic speakers on the cast and that carries him a lot. Other than that he’s a pretty good voice of reason for the shit that is this season and he has some fun background moments like being genuinely astounded to the point of having to bury his head in his hands when Tarzan goes off on his race spiel. I like his FTC speech too.

Overall Ranking: 223/653

1: **Sabrina Thompson** - She has some really good if not great moments and that easily carries her to #1. Of course the main one everyone will think of is her top-tier Day 39 confessional which is of course excellent, but she also has some great voting confessionals towards the end of the game, to Kat and Christina. I think she was the most engaging speaker as well and that easily makes her my #1 for this season.

"e0bnqix","&gt; You are right, we don't know if Ben slaughtered innocents, but as of now that is what we are told. **I think if they go back on that it makes Luke's character look even worse. **

Not necessarily.  Snoke's greater goal was stopping Luke. Turning Ben was just a bonus he did not care nearly as much about. There are a lot of hints in the novel that Snoke was manipulating the entire family, not just Ben. If you watch Ben's perspective on the way Luke looks in the flashback, he seems crazed. Its possible Snoke was messing with both Luke and Ben's perspective. This is the same guy that was messing with Ben's head for years and was able to bridge Rey and Ben's minds across a galaxy. Influencing Luke for a few seconds when Luke was unaware and unguarded is not a stretch. If you add in the KOR as possible plants sent to kill Luke's students and bring Ben to him (remember Snoke's goal through two movies was to STOP Luke from training Jedi) then that entire night was a setup and Luke was as much a victim as Ben.

&gt;If Ben only broke stuff around the house and Leia and Han couldn't handle him, that would be pretty crappy on their part. 

Keep in mind that he was using the force to break things. Leia and Han were concerned because, well, his grandfather spent years as a evil homicidal villain. It is kinda crap they would do that but I think they meant well and Luke actually thought he could help. IMO, the end of the story is that the family was a tale of tragedy. 

This is why Ben's redemption and NOT dying is so key to the saga ending well. If Ben is redeemed and lives, the family wins over Snoke and the sacrifices made by Han and Luke will mean something. If Ben stays evil or dies, then Snoke ultimately won in destroying the family and that is a terrible way to end the saga.

Edited to add: Also if Ben did not kill those student, it also suggests Ben hadn't really turned at that point and that actually lifts some of the responsibility for Ben's turn from Luke's shoulders. Right now, the final trigger for Ben's turn is on Luke. That might not be the case.",1528461184,"influencing luke for a few seconds when luke was unaware and unguarded is not a stretch.","unaware and unguarded","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unguarded","unguarded",NA,NA,1

"e01gmyg","It's unfortunate, but there are men who support this behavior. The issue is that many men are still committed to the idea that most women are good, chaste, and TRULY interested in marrying men who will make great husbands and fathers. Consistent with years of Blue Pill/Social Conditioning, many men are unaware and unknowing of the dual\-sexual strategy implemented by many women \- ""only use Bad Boys for sex but marry the Good Guy\-Beta Orbiter."" It's the base reason that women are OPENLY encouraging this behavior. 

This may be true, most women might *actually* have interest in marrying men who will make great husbands and fathers \- the problem and principal issue is that despite this desire many women freely offer time, effort, energy, love, dedication, commitment, love, and enthusiastic sex to Bad Boys and douchebag losers and THEN attempt to transition to Good Men. 

Association, time, effort, and energy offered to deadbeat men leaves women arriving with emotional baggage, issues, and numerous problems. Even worse \- there are women with expectation that Good Men should have no issue assuming responsibility and happily raise the Bad Boy's children. It's another reason women hate judgment for past sexual history and shame men for their ""insecurities"" and other classic shaming\-tactics that are highly effective on BP Men, and unsuspecting and less experienced men. 

Many men instinctively understand this is problematic and in fact question this behavior among women, yet still accept women who passed themselves around to Bad Boys with no shame.

[Goblin Punch on OSR Style Challanges](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html) might be what you are looking for. [Zaks post on Different Kinds of Player Skill](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2012/05/kinds-of-player-skill.html?zx=b67f2020f4755836) is also good (it is important to note that ""player skill"" as used when talking in the OSR excludes things like character building in Pathfinder, even though it requires player skill to build an effective Pathfinder character). [Combat as Sport vs Combat as War](http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?317715-Very-Long-Combat-as-Sport-vs-Combat-as-War-a-Key-Difference-in-D-amp-D-Play-Styles) captures how OSR games approaches combat. 

&gt;From what I understand of OSR design sensibilities, this very powerful enemy may be so powerful in an OSR version of this same interaction that the party is highly incentivized to resort to combat last. The party might instead study the enemy and its motivations and cater to or subvert those motivations in order to coerce the enemy to give the party what it wants. Is this a reasonable understanding of how OSR approaches combat versus more modern games?

Yes and no. You assume that the party is on a collision course with a very powerful enemy. If you are in this situation in an OSR game, you probably have already lost, unless the party has an advantage. Lets look at [Better than any Man](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116452/Better-Than-Any-Man) as an example of an OSR adventure. There are some very powerful beings in the adventure. But at the start, they are unaware and uninterested in the PCs. If the PCs manage to piss one of these beings of in a way in which they know the PCs are responsible, the adventure is going to get a lot harder. The best plan of action for the PCs is to try to avoid these powerful beings as much as possible (while still stealing their stuff). Direct confrontation is suicidal.

"dy7lozm","(My apologies that this is long. TL/DR at bottom) 

Dealing with disability and infertility. I would like to share my story to give some background (so that your replies or suggestions might understand where I'm coming from.)

 So here it goes;

I grew up wanting to be a first responder. I worked hard, remained drug free and well behaved to become a police officer. Despite some serious setbacks, I graduated college (1st in my family) and the police academy and became a Sheriff's Deputy.

 I had always envisioned my life; working hard until retirement. I always wanted to be child-free and I had hoped to find a husband, to travel, and to enjoy a long fruitful career, maybe one day teaching.  That was it.

Within a few years, I was succeeding with my life in Florida (over 1000 miles from any family)-  but I'd made some friends, worked my way into a respected place in my career, I'd bought a house and I was happy.

My entire life went off the rails at 29.

By then, I was in a very successful place in my career;  I had recently been promoted, I was well-liked, my squad was like a family, I was extremely productive and it was being noticed and my nightshift schedule was exactly what I wanted. 

Very suddenly though, I was transferred. 

 I had to adjust to MANY negative changes and was feeling crushed.  It came to light that my sudden transfer was caused by a coworker (in the Narcotics Division) who had being caught STEALING from a crime scene. After many years of night shift, I had to be up at 3 am to slog through days in a completely different part of the county and I lost everything I worked for...all while I watched a thief and liar thriving and happy with my old squad. 

 I was trying to rebound by just focusing on work. Prior to the transfer, I had been casually dating a divorced coworker but during this time, I told him I needed some space and we cooled off. 

I had a surgery scheduled &amp; the meds made me very loopy with no memory and I didn't want any issues. The guy I had been dating offered to come stay on my couch for two days after my surgery, to help monitor my medications and to help me recover from the surgery. I trusted him to do that.... Biggest mistake of my life. 

Three weeks later, despite being on birth control, and having not had sex for over two months....I found out that I was pregnant. It came out, in time, that the guy I'd been casually dating previously, had given me excessive medication after my surgery and had assaulted me while I was unaware and unable to remember. When confronted, he insisted that I had said and done things i had no memory of and that he ""didn't know"" I was impaired and that he'd just ""gone along with it"". 

I was angry but didn't feel right about ending his career and having him jailed for assault, even though I'm retrospect, it's very clear that that's what happened. I even later found out that he'd sabotaged my birth control, that he was NOT actually divorced, and that he and his wife had essentially agreed that he'd find a girlfriend who didn't want kids, impregnate her and hopefully bring a child back for them. (She was unable to have kids.). I was LIVID. 

Despite very much not wanting children - i was uncomfortable with the idea of an abortion. (I fully support a woman's choice- but I made and cancelled yep separate appointments, unable to go through with it.). 

Instead, I realized that without the ability to take adequate time off from work ( I didn't have enough paid leave, I couldn't afford months of UNPAID leave, and an attorney quickly advised me that if I stayed - when the baby came, my rapist could claim paternity,sue for custody and keep me from leaving the state- so my only option was to leave my career, leave my home to forclosure (in the market, I couldnt sell) and so I moved back to my parents and friends in NJ, intending to go back to law enforcement after giving the baby up for addition. 

I was also advised that because he WANTED the baby, my only choice was to give the baby up via safe haven laws, because by default, if I didn't want to parent, the baby would be given to my rapist. So I planned that after the birth, my family would take me out of state to a hospital (different from where I gave birth) to safely surrender the baby where he could find a loving home.

**Alaskan Deal:** Locke contracts the crew to oversee a weapons trade in Alaska with the Butcher, but double crosses them both to the FBI. The gang escapes on one of the Butcher's ships.

**Diamond Heist:** The gang robs the Garnet Group vault to cut off Locke's funding, as the Group still has ties to Murkywater. They bring in the art thief August ""Duke"" Lindhurst to help.

**Reservoir Dogs:** Bain sets up a job with the Cabot crime family in Los Angeles - a jewellery store hit. It turns out to be a police sting, and while Mr. Brown is killed the gang and the Dogs escape. However, Bain's hideout is raided, presumably by a secret group known as the Kataru, and he is captured or killed. He tells them to trust Locke before losing contact, and Locke tells the crew that the betrayal in Alaska was just a ruse to keep them out of Washington DC for a while.

**Brooklyn Bank:** Following a hint from Bain, and a clue from Duke, the gang hit a Harvest &amp; Trustee branch in Brooklyn to find an item buried in the bank's foundation.

**Breakin' Feds:** Locke discovers that the Kataru have Bain - or at the very least, his corpse - and are planning to trade him to Commissioner Garrett in exchange for a strange item in his possession. This item is related to the one the gang stole from Brooklyn, and possibly even the Dentist's loot from the Golden Grin. The gang sneak into the FBI headquarters to steal the item from Garrett's office before the deal goes down, though they have to make sure he remains alive and unaware.

"dxwp3ca","&gt; Not at all, because like I said (and as you chose to ignore)

Yeah, it's ignored because it's bullshit, and you're rolling back your losing position.

&gt; This means that, regardless of how I personally feel about it, it's still a valid viewpoint to have.

No, as explained, it's bullshit.

&gt; So, lets talk more. This is fun.

I agree. So much fun.

&gt; This is a great one. Ok, so once again, the term bigot pops up in the same sentence where you mention that you disagree with someone. Fabulous.

&gt; You know what? I'll give it to you. El Presidente isn't exactly the nicest of people

1. He isn't ""not exactly the nicest"", he's a monster.
2. If you concede it, then don't fucking argue with it.

&gt; I'm aware of his racism, but I'm gonna need some sources on the violence against women and pedophilia things.

You're not entitled to sources. You've been babbling out of your ass, without sources, for several comments now, and so, in your next comment, you will source every single one of your previous claims, and only then will I source mine.

Chop chop.

&gt; Now, lets talk ""fascist"". Why fascist? Explain to me what's makes him a fascist other than the fact that you don't like the man.

Straw man argument. I did not say he's a fascist for no other reason that I don't like him. This is you being a compulsive liar again.

&gt; I'm not going into the ""Kremlin-compromised traitor"", as I have nothing for or against this statement.

That's because, as mentioned earlier, you are blissfully unaware and ignorant of the world around you.

&gt; AKA I'm going to complain about the words he used simply because that just suits me better rather than listening to what it is he's trying to say.

Straw man argument. I didn't just ""complain about the words he used"". Again, you're being a compulsive, shameless liar.

&gt; The point still stands

There is no point, and you have no point, other than the points you're fabricating, and then abandoning quickly after realising how incredibly weak, simplistic and fallible your ramblings are.

&gt; So, which parts of your massive amount if invalid points are you referring to, or do you mean your entire post?

Ah, ""No U"" .. congratulations on your painful lack of imagination.

&gt; Because it couldn't have been my post. 

Perhaps this is getting to be too advanced for you to understand. I was referencing a future situation in which the amount of falsehoods, fallacies and other invalid drivel exceeds anything reasonable, to the point where the noise-generating tactic itself must be identified and the bullshitter exposed. This is a form of valid ad hominem: a complete loss of credibility.

&gt; I was waiting to hear you speak about straw man arguments. 

No you weren't. You've retroactively invented your prediction to enhance your standing. It's pathetic. And transparent.

&gt; Buddy,

I'm not your buddy.

&gt; But considering on your other post right below these is ""We also know half of these motherfuckers spend their time posting on alt-right forums, subs, blogs and fake news websites about anti-Semitic Rothschild conspiracy theories when they're not bashing Muslims."", I'm going to go ahead 

... and again spout some more  lies and inaccuracies. This isn't too complicated, not even for you. Then again, perhaps it is. So let's break this down for you. ""These &amp;#x6D;other&amp;#x66;uckers"" has the word ""these"" in it. What is ""these""? It's a *plural proximate demonstrative*. What is a demonstrative?

&gt; Demonstratives (abbreviated DEM) are words, such as this and that, **used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative

This is what is called ""specificity"", and not only that, I reduce this by half, and I'm referring specifically to people who spout bigotry against Muslims on behalf of Jews while being anti-Semites themselves. 

Now, does it compute with respect to your claim that I, and I quote:

&gt; call everyone around you a bigot

? 

No, it doesn't. Because you are claiming I call *everyone around me* a bigot, when I'm using specific semantics to denote *specificity*. 

Hence, you're a shameless, strawmanning liar. QED.

&gt; Nice, more buzzwords to throw.

Learn something from it.

&gt; How many upvotes does calling someone alt-right get you? 

Lots, I'm loving it. Live for the karma, die for the karma. Any other idiotic little meaningless jabs?

&gt; You've got a great vocabulary, feel free to tell me.

Just go back to the school you've never finished, and plead for them to fix the gaping lacuna in your intellect.

""Lacuna"" - this is your word for this comment. Memorise it, find a suitable occasion for it. Got it? 

&gt;  I don't see another reason to affiliate me with those people. 

Calling for a European ""Muslim ban"" qualifies. I don't care if you're too squeemish to stick to your guns and backpedal later with laughable excuses about playing ""devil's advocate"". 

&gt; You simply started going on about ""well why don't we just ban EVERYONE"". That doesn't refute my point

You never had one.

&gt; Well that is a shame. Now my point about how he was already in the country in the first place

Apparently this is another difficult concept for you: I am talking about refusing any sort of access to Europe to extremists like him, should they wish to emigrate or visit. And there are lots like him.

Note how you are again forced to concede something you didn't wish to acknowledge, because as we all know, people like you like to paint white supremacists, alt-rightists, Incels and other Trumpist, far-right freaks as ""lone wolves with mental issues"", while allocating every other Islamist incident as a group effort, even if many of them are similarly without centralised direction from a terrorist organisation.

&gt; Again, you bring up points that don't contradict mine

False.

&gt; My points are still solid

False, you have no points.

&gt; You haven't rebuked a single one.

You're compulsively lying again. I've made minced meat out of every single fallacious, ignorant or outright false statement of yours, and you've already walked back several.

&gt; I would love to know HOW you want to do this. No wait, let me guess. We monitor their private conversations on social media and jail anyone who tweets anything offensive, right?

And exactly ""HOW"" would *you* enforce your ""don't let anybody in"" ""ban""? Exactly how are you going to conduct a ""hateful Muslim""-test? Will you be going by skin colour? Nationality? Speculated ethnicity? Will you have some ignorants with badges ask some utterly braindead questions? 

What exactly? Or you'll ban ""everyone""? Everyone who?  From where?

And if not everyone, then how will you ban ""some""? Some who? And how?

You see, I first want to know how you think you can do one but not the other, and then we'll get into details.

&gt; I would also like to know one more thing. Why only right-wing extremists. Surely you mean extremists of all kinds

Yes, I concede this is the case.

Many are doing it unintentionally. This often displays nicely the power of confirmation bias and rationalization on decision making regarding conclusions about reality.

&gt;I honestly do claim that it must be included in our argument about a creator god what it says his name is in the original text about himself /=will be being/will be making to be/ .

This is utterly irrelevant to evolution.

&gt;And yes it is a possibility to modernize it even to ""evolution.""

No, it absolutely is not. That is a massive stretch, completely beyond what is implied by those two words.

&gt;It is more dishonest to pretend it is not possible to translate it this way than the opposite.

Absolute balderdash. It simply cannot be parsed this way in any intellectually honest manner notwithstanding being under the influence of confirmation bias, as it simply does not say that.

&gt;to try to silence me with character assassination shows you may be hypnotized by the mass censorship of those who prefer Jews to stay mum.

Strawman. I never attempted to assasinate your character. I don't *know* your character. Your particular religion is both not relevant, as they *all* are unsupported, and I was not aware of which it was until this moment. I only have the scant information provided, one position on one issue. I did, and am, however, pointing out that that interpretation and those beliefs are utterly unsupported. And the rest of the sentence strays rather unfortunately far into territory that is both not relevant whatsoever to our discussion, and implies something that is both unsupported and rude. Thus I dismiss it and in the spirit of [debate charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) will ignore it.

&gt;well it shows a deliberate abd iterative intention to hurt me.

It appears you may be completely unaware of a very important concept, at least as it applies to this particular conversation.  It is vitally important to understand the crucial, fundamental, and important difference between criticizing, attacking, debating, finding fault with, and attempting to tear apart *ideas*, and doing the same things to a *person.*

The former *must* be embraced and encouraged by any sane and healthy society. As ideas can be and often *are* wrong. It is only by doing this to ideas that one can root out the poor ideas from those that can be supported and shown valid and sound. That is one of the key purposes of debate. To offer up your ideas and invite others to do their very best to tear them apart with absolute ferocity, and therefore one can discard one's ideas if and when found invalid and unsound. It is one of the reasons I particpate in debate, and invite others to do this to my ideas. I want as few wrong ideas and as many correct ideas as possible. As this leads to better overall results in life and in, well, absolutely everything.

This is *not* an attack on a person. Those who attempt to characterize it this way are not being honest, typically with themselves, and are not showing an ability to separate a position on an issue, which can and should change when shown incorrect, and their overall value as a human being.

So I reject and dismiss the above.

&gt;To call me dishonest is not an argument. 

This is an example of this. It is reasonable, and indeed useful to both parties, to point out if someone is being dishonest. This comment is directed towards a particular point someone may have made. This does not imply that a person is overall dishonest, or even that the dishonesty is intentional. Often it is not, it's very often unaware and unintentional dishonesty. Of course, my assertion that a point is dishonest is a *claim*, and I am responsible for supporting this and it, and I, can be *wrong*. If so, provide information as to why it is wrong (I already provided support as to why it appears correct), or at least not right, rendering us both with, at the least, the null hypothesis position. In any case, I am more than willing to concede, if it pleases you, that you were not being intentionally dishonest. However, it is trivially demonstrable that this tactic is often used with intentional dishonesty. I maintain, however, that you are incorrect.

"dwz8v1e","I think everyone who eats 3 square meals a day, is writing a comment on a computer or smartphone, and has a job has no place to complain. If they are intelligent enough to write comments on reddit, then they should be intelligent enough to make smart long term decisions when it comes to upwards socioeconomic mobility.

However, many people lack the vision, hard work ethic, and sacrifice it takes to properly move up in the world. They make poor economic and lifestyle choices that make their ability to move upwards harder. Then, when their personal story turns out to be quite the tragedy, it becomes easy to blame the wealthy for their own personal failures. At least in America, there are an abundance of resources available for educating yourself and straightening yourself out so that the life you live is meaningful and not miserable. 

The problem is that people believe that happiness lies in an abundance of wealth, which is ridiculous. If you're personally making at least $75,000 a year, which most people should be able to attain through proper education and work application over the course of 10/20/30 years, then you have more than enough to feed, clothe, and shelter yourself. You've got your basic necessities met, and now happiness is found through keeping good mental and physical health and maintaining positive relationships with your community and having a deeper purpose in life. 

So what if the richest 1% have 50% of the worlds wealth, if each individual is not starving, naked, and unsheltered, and has the ability to freely apply themselves unrestricted of tyranny and oppression, then what does it matter what the rich have? Inequality is a natural part of life, we should be fighting on making sure that those who are genuinely at a disadvantage and have nothing are able to not start at zero but start at one. 

Many people are jealous, which is natural of humans. Everyone is born with different advantages and opportunities. We shouldn't ever discourage anyone from taking advantage of an opportunity they've been given, but rather make it so that we can provide those same opportunities to our offspring when they are growing up. But this takes a very selfless, wise understanding of life. Many people simply are unaware and selfish, and refuse to move beyond themselves, and see all the ways their life is tragic and unfair, and become bitter and resentful. The day anyone stops seeing life full of meaning and potential growth, is the day they start dying and moving closer to a living hell. Without a vision, some sort of higher realization of themselves, the human being withers aware and devolves into pathetic nihilism. No amount of money will ever bring true meaning into life. We should all have our basic needs met no doubt, but once that is met, we shouldn't hinder our own growth and development with petty contempt for those with more money than us.

I also have ankylosing spondylitis, and nerve damage from a shitty spine surgeon.

After living in dallas for 15 years I decided I finally needed to meet my family at the state fair. After finding a place to park my sister notifies me that I have to meet them on the opposite side since she has the tickets. I start to try and walk around without going outside of the gate because their are sketchy people and crazy ass drivers trying to find parking. 

So I make it to dead end, and I start trying to ask for directions, get frustrated, and start to appear belligerent, so the people threaten to have me arrested if I do not turn around and go back. So I give up and approach a (older decorated guy) DPD, in a lifeguard looking chair, for help. I explain my situation. He tells me I cannot get through the park w/o purchasing a ticket, I fell the ‘no shit Sherlock’ coming up, but ask him if there is anyone who can help me, or any way. He tell me no, He cannot help me, I have to walk around the fenced grounds ( if you have not seen the state fairgrounds, it’s no small field, I usually interact with it in small pieces). I informed him I was autistic and situationally unaware, and also cannot walk that far with nerve damage to my back and leg. He told me he couldn’t help me, that wasn’t his job.

This is when I started to loose it. I asked him what his  job was, and he said it was to watch the booths for thieves... I asked all sorts of shit: he couldn’t find someone to help me, he couldn’t tell me where I could go to find someone else to help me, there wasn’t anyone here who could help me.... in perfect timing a couple brought up their CHL for him to inspect (which apparently WAS a part of his job) and my sister calls and my meltdown/ tantrum is complete: I start hyperventilating and crying.  This is when they guy says ok I can call a car for you. By then my sister had calmed me down and told me to just go home: there were too many people and too much walking ( in nice terms).

"dsyxqna","Science is limited in finding the truth of the human experience. It is great, actually the only way to find out physical properties of things - the elements, atoms, etc. We use science to create machines that early humans could never dream of, to make our lives more convenient than ever in human history. We live longer, we have heat, light, AC, airplanes and cures to diseases due to science. Science is formidable and the only to find the 'truth' of the physical attributes of solid objects.

But science says nothing about say.. the great novels of human history and how it shaped us as humans. Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick, the protons and electrons involved in the physical books say nothing about the life lessons found in each. And science runs counter to human experience often.

For example, why do we 'love,' love our children or why should we love our neighbours? All they do is use up valuable resources that will impede our own survival. The argument of a scientific basis of morality, I find very lacking. We supposedly 'love' because this will allow us to survive because it's better to take care of each other? This sounds like special pleading, the clear and basic way to survive is to kill off the competitors, without exception.

But no one does. Everyone loves their kids, everyone is emotional and values things, which in a purely naturalism based world would be infinitely inefficient and pointless. Why even take care of your kids in this context? So the human race can survive? Why does that even matter, we should just be doing all we can to survive on our own and when we're dead, we're dead. Humanity's lifespan is objectively finite anyway.

Yet no one lives like this, everyone without exception holds on to things that are irrational objectively - taking care of your babies, taking care of handicapped people, old people. This is what defines the human experience, not looking at molecules in a microscope. Indeed most people on this earth live their lives quite unaware and unconcerned with the topic of science.

Stuff like this leads me to believe in God. No, God cannot be perceived by the five senses, but neither can any emotion (you can only see chemical changes in the brain). God also produces chemical changes in the brain and much more. It was a long path but I can't be an atheist anymore, it's an impossibility for me.

The screeching sound of scraping metal grew nearer to the castle exit. Trails of flying sparks were the only form illumination in the dark hall. The Koopa Army watched as a familiar face stepped out into the light, behind him he dragged a massive spiked shell.

He tossed the shell forward. ""I have killed your king! I am now, Koopa King!"" Mario walked past the shell approaching the group. They stood together and menacingly stared at him. ""And next is the Mushroom Kingdom."" He smiled. They all exchanged confused glances but slowly returned their gaze to Mario and kneeled. He turned from them and began walking down the path. ""Come."" He commanded.

He brought them to a familiar yellow brick. The symbol of a question mark glowed inside. Mario simply pointed to the block and gestured that a Koopa come forward. The Koopa jumped, failing to reach the block.

Mario shook his head and held out a hand. ""Your shell."" He demanded. The Koopa, looking with horror, removed his shell and handed it to Mario. Gripping the shell Mario walked below the block and tossed the shell up into it. The tone sounded and from within the block and mushroom ejected. He handed the Koopa back his shell and had him stand still for the mushroom. When the mushroom collided with the Koopa he yelled and grew until he stood taller than Mario.

""This,"" Mario yelled, ""Is a mystery block,  loyal servants of the toadstool throne secretly plant these powerful items inside to assit me in my mission. Though they make sure that the Koopa Army is unaware and incapable of receiving them, I have taught you how.""

A larger Koopa stepped forward from the group, he had a belt of hammers hanging around his hips. ""What are your orders King?"" The Hammer Bro asked. Mario reached into his pocket and removed and small glass square. Inside the square was a picture of a flower.

""Here."" Mario handed the Hammer Bro the square. ""Crush it."" The Hammer Bro dropped the square on the ground and stomped on it. A cone of flame erupted around him startling the group. Quickly the flames dissipated revealing a Koopa with a red helmet around his head and a bright red shell. ""Send a troop to every world and begin collecting these powers."" He handed him a stack of squares. ""Give each group one of these if they touch the item with it, it seals the power within."" He stared up at the castle. ""Also, start up the airships, I'd like to go for a ride.""

The troop of Koopas broke away to carry out the orders they'd been given. Mario walked along the road in silence staring at the clouds. He stopped in front of the castle and looked at Bowser's shell. Removing an item slot from his pocket he pressed it against the shell. A whirling stream of air surrounded the shell and pulled it inside forming the image of a spiked shell in the square. Mario tucked the square away and headed inside.

""Your airship is ready my King."" A Koopa announced upon his arrival.

""Excellent."" Mario announced and made his way on board. The ceiling above them folded away and the massive ship rose into the sky. Mario walked to the front of the ship and stared across the horizon. He turned to face the crowd. ""Tell the other ships to set off for the other worlds, plunder the toad houses and steal their items. We need as much as we can get. We'll go the the second world for now there's something I need.""

The Hammer Bro from before approached Mario. ""King Koopa."" He saluted. ""Soon the Koopalings will be in full health again. What do you plan to do about them?""

""When the time comes, I will deal with them. For now just take us to our destination.""

""Aye, King!"" The Ice Bro shouted.

Mario stepped up onto the bow of the ship. In the distance the Toadstool castle became visible through the clouds. Mario smiled as the castle grew nearer. In a harsh and menacing tone he spoke, ""It's a me *Mario*.""

"dsfezu9","&gt; How am i supposed to flank with a tank which can barely reach 30 km/h on roads while the enemy has M18s? Also i'm mostly getting games where Japan is with the Allies, go figure.

If Japan matches with the Allies that means that it has to be US/UK/JPN versus GER/RUS/FRA.  US/UK/FRA/JPN vs GER/RUS match ups don't happen, and everyone versus GER doesn't happen.  In that case if German tankers are getting murdered at a disproportionately higher rate than everyone else, it further proves it is just user error on German tanks part.  

Also, you don't need to be as fast as an M18 to flank on most maps.  In fact most tanks can flank pretty easily on all but the biggest maps and then even on the largest maps, since sight lines are so long its not hard to just flank slower and counter faster moving tanks.  And flanking doesn't necessarily have to mean going to the edge of the map or even being the first one out there.  If you drive out somewhere to meet an M18, and the M18 is pre-engaged with someone else you'll catch them off guard and since youre likely in a tank with armor, you'll probably win.  Not to mention simply playing defensively and pushing slowly, keeping an eye on your flanks, or moving in such a way that prevents flanking can stonewall tanks like the M18.  They're not some uncounterable beasts, it's pretty straight forward and German tankers seemingly refuse to do it in anything but an RU 251.  

&gt; Allied teams can be just as oblivious

That's just players in this game.  But Germans are still disproportionately more unaware and blind than other nations.  Its not uncommon at all to begin shooting a group of German tanks in the side and have none of them react and instead continually shoot at others while their allies around them all die mysteriously fast.  

&gt; That's what i'm trying to argue while being downvoted.

Except you're not?  You're blaming post-war tanks, you're blaming OP tanks, you're blaming underperforming German tanks, but not once before have you said it's due to the diversity that an allied line up gets.  OP flat out states its bullshit how your Tiger fights post-war tanks.  

And if you're struggling to get kills in German SPAA, the literal best SPAA in the entire game until you get to tier VI stuff, I have no idea what to tell you.

Their subjective perception while valid, doesn't seem to be align with your perception of mysterious. You might think INFJs are mysterious, they might think ENFPs are mysterious. It really doesn't mean they're mysterious in the same way. It just means they are mysterious to them. It's not an objective word. Both types can be mysterious to a person who have never been exposed to or dealth with an ENFP's more calm and internally intense side. When we associate mysterious we need to realise INFJs are rare and their inner workings are different than most people therefore it is not 'normal' in relation to the society. ENFPs are easy to me because we go by (with exceptions) similar inner working and it's very easy to have matching ideals. It doesn't mean everyone else should or could think that way. It's completely subjective. You are free to think this trait are more suitable to INFJs but please let the benefit of the doubt sink in that you are weird in an interesting way to someone else that they haven't thought about before.

I don't believe types have anything to do with intelligence. How do we even measure it? IQ (heavily skewed towards NTs)? Exams (Memorise all the answers and formats)? Trivial knowledge (enthusiasm and curiosity)? Language? Emotional? 

Humans are capable or learning and mastering a skill if they spend enough time and effort into it, who is to say intelligence can't be cultivated? IMO it has no correlation -- thinkers just have more practice for their whole lives in their thinking functions and vice versa. I've met dumb INTPs and smart ESFPs.

"druzmp2","I actually had the opposite. I really loved the graphical improvements and such that came with the enhanced edition, but I actually found myself enjoying the game more with the 'voice' slider turned to zero in the audio options.  
  
There was something jarring about having certain characters being *given* a voice, whereas during my first few playthroughs in the classic edition, I was able to imagine what they were like based on their lines. The voice acting often conflicted with how I felt the characters were actually being constructed, and it took away from the experience.  
  
For example, Madora's voice acting completely changed how her character felt. From just reading her lines in the classic edition, I got the impression that she was a character who put on a proud, boisterous facade in order to disguise a lot of internal conflict and resentment. Listening to her lines being voice acted with that ridiculous accent just makes her sound shallow, unaware and unintelligent - even in seemingly 'serious' moments.  
  
Jahan is another example. Based on his lines he came across as arrogant and resentful, although he was definitely a deep thinker and someone with a very rigid and long-developed philosophy on life.

As a young adult (and an older adult), it provided a slight easing of my social anxiety. In the last few years of my drinking (I had a six year relapse after over 11 years sober), I drank to not feel my anger, sadness and other emotions around infidelity by my spouse and the general emptiness of that 25+ year relationship.  (If you look for Monday’s Quote, you’ll see I found a passage in a book I’m reading that was relevant to that.)

During my 11 years of sobriety, I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was fully committed to *recovery*, and there’s a big difference between the two. In sobriety, I maintained **many** of those old, stuck patterns. Maybe my anger didn’t get as big, maybe my other emotions and behaviors weren’t so destructive, but I never unwound how they got there in the first place. I intellectually knew some of it, but I couldn’t think my way out of something I had lived my way into (i.e. my stuck patterns). I first had to understand them and then work on developing both an idea of how they served me (because they did or I wouldn’t have done them), how they held me back, which was more powerful, and if I wanted something different, what was it? If I didn’t know, then I couldn’t take action to create it. 

That led me to sobriety work, therapy and meditation. Sobriety work because, well, doh. SD is my faithful companion for that part of the journey and books and podcasts (I don’t do AA). 

Therapy to unwind the faulty beliefs about my lack of worthiness (still working on it).  Meditation to understand that my mind has a mind of its own and I don’t necessarily have to belief everything I think. It helped me have more mindfulness about my thoughts, actions, and how I *want* to be in the world. I slowly develop compassion for those parts of myself that are still stuck and unaware. And the more I focus on being in service to others, the less I stay in my little narcissistic world (which is where most of my stuck was comes from). 

So that’s a long way of saying yes, I stayed stuck, even when sober, for a fucking long time, then I got drunk again for six years and then I finally was done with both.

"dr53m0o","I posted this elsewhere. Hopefully, I can post it here too. I'm an AW married to an AM and watching this video made me uneasy. Natalie seems great. I don't have a problem with IR and didn't know it was a big thing in some places. Majority of AM are with AW out in the world and where I live. I know there's a possibility my children will have an IR and my husband and I don't have a problem with that. I've always been very proud of my identity and raise my children to be the same. I've read that African American women have the highest self-esteem. I think Asians are like that. My children think being Asian is cool, especially now with the travel, food, actors, singers, directors, boy/girl bands and rappers. I've never felt inferior to any race. I actually think Asians and POC are the most beautiful. Caucasians are also very beautiful. I think I'm normal. I think most Asians are this way. I grew up watching western media in America but I also grew up among strong proud AW and AM. Asians at my schools were the popular ones. I admired and appreciated Kurosawa, Tran Nữ Yên Khê, Ang Lee, Bruce Lee, Wong Kar Wai, Gong Li, Joan Chen, Tran Anh Hùng, Zhang Yimou, Jet Li, Won Bin, Jang Dong Gun, John Lone, Song Kang Ho, Yunjin Kim, Russell Wong, Jason Scott Lee, Sung Kang, Justin Lin, John Cho, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, Ming Na Wen, etc. I had crushes on a lot of the Asian actors. I was amazed at some American films only to find out recently they were copies of the Asian originals.

I had some issues with the portrayal of AM in the video. Pictures, cartoons, images of Mickey Rooney and the actor in Sixteen Candles. Historical and cultural references but they were there. I remember these images and it didn't bother me but now I'm more aware. The war pictures and propaganda were ugly and violent contrasted with the peaceful image of Natalie and her SO walking. Image and perception is everything. It's horrible that Natalie has these type of hateful comments and harassment directed at her. I believe these comments come from a tiny minority of AM. Most AM are not this damaging. Now when people say I'm an AM or AW online and write something toxic or abrasive, I have to question their identity. There are instances of non Asian people appropriating our identities.

The ""experts"" in the video say valid things but have some baggage and controversy. Why were these experts chosen? And it was negative portrayal after the other. Why was so much of the focus on bitter Asian men when they are in the minority and not on the dynamics of the relationship itself? I think it wasn't an evenhanded approach. I can't imagine the fear and outrage Natalie must have gone through receiving these messages. I worry about my daughter receiving this type of harassment. But this sends the message that Asian men, for the most part, are to blame and they're the ones dysfunctional. Which is simply not true for the majority of Asian men. I think I read that Natalie couldn't reach others for an interview. Phil at the end eased my worries to a degree. I love Phil and I love his team. They're doing great things and we need more creators like them. 

The reason why I'm passionate about Asian issues is I'm a mother of Asian children. I wouldn't want them to watch this video. I felt the earlier parts of the video regurgitate how the western media portrays AM. I don't think impressionable young people should watch this video. It doesn't help the divide between some AW and AM and it might actually be harmful. I read some of the comments on YT and they were very divisive, toxic and full of self-hate and entitlement coming from all races. Having this type of video and seeing some of the hateful comments perpetuate the idea that AW only exist to cater to certain men. This leads to violence against AW and AM. This has been more in the news and I think it's dangerous. And there were comments from AM saying they should give up and believe they are inferior to other men. This is so sad. You have to realize that these AM could be our brothers, fathers, and sons. What caused these men to think this way? Is it a matter of being strong and learning to question and fight everything that harms them? I know it's hard with the western media. But some AM were appreciative. I don't know. I didn't realize until recently that media is pervasive and causes white worship/self hate. I ached to see people like us in media and was happy to see Asian talent but it was rare. Now I'm bothered when there's no diversity and I refuse to watch. I've had a couple of instances when AW said something negative about AM knowing I'm married to an AM. The former was when I was young and unaware and the latter I asked the friend why she felt this way? She really didn't have an answer. I have to rethink my choices. Why do I read books mainly from non Asian authors? Things like that. I used to think Hollywood is progressive and it's all about the money. Now i realize there are those who want us in our place, depicted as weak, ugly, unnecessary and something to laugh at. This is why we need to create and support our own content. I used to read articles from people that I admired saying we are dirty, uncivilized and not to be trusted. I boycott a lot of media now when I used to watch everything. I can't say enough that we have to make the choice to be aware, absorb materials besides western media and appreciate Asian content. Asian influence is everywhere. You can seek it out. The world is smaller. And it's amazing. I see more non Asians including my friends loving Asian media.

You have to raise your children to love their Asian culture. Otherwise, it can be a loss to their self worth and mental health. I personally know some Asian girls who are struggling and I tell their mothers to teach their girls to embrace their culture. Reading a lot of personal stories from fellow Asians who are struggling made me realize that growing up in a positive Asian community is extremely important.

Pros: 

* It's relatively cheap and affordable.  I am renting right now, but planning to buy something within the year.  My rent is $1k (got in before the huge spike and been renewing my lease).  I would never be able to afford anything in SF nowadays, even if I wanted to.  Rent is probably closer to $1300 where I'm at now.  

* I'd say, in general, Sacramento is more integrated than SF or LA.  People are more mixed up in Sacramento than other areas.  

* Good food and restaurant scene!  There's so much good food and beer here.  

Cons: 

* Transit is horrendous.  Unless you live on the grid, it's pretty tough to get around on mass transit.  In SF, there is MUNI and BART - I've never been to NJ or NY, but I assume the transit is relatively good.. Sacramento is a car city.  The grid has a lot of bikers and walkers, but if you live in like.. Natomas, you're not getting anywhere without a car.  

* People are horrible drivers.  Yes, you'll hear this about every city.. but coming from SF, Sacramento drivers are unaware and indecisive.  

* It's kind of a boring city.  There's not that much to do, unless you want to eat and drink.  I have absolutely no idea what the under-21 crowd does here since there isn't much.  

In general, Sacramento is an okay city.  It doesn't feel like a big city like SF or LA.  It feels a lot smaller and runs a lot ""slower"".  It's an okay city.

Yellow: Relaxed alert. No specific threat situation. Your mindset is that ""today could be the day I may have to defend myself"".

Orange: Specific alert. Something is not quite right and has your attention. Your radar has picked up a specific alert.

Having Interns have the responsibility of a full time salary employee while only getting 10-15/hr for long periods of time (6-12 months) doing a job that pays 45-60k entry level)

Having Interns work 30-40+ hr weeks during college semesters 

Not including bonuses or any pay raise for Interns extended throughout a school year (not summer Interns) 

Setting performance standards that are nearly impossible to meet so that when the time comes to hire someone full time they have as many excuses as possible not to do so, enabling better margins for managers etc who had good production or revenue  with a low head count (due to intern help). Easy for them to go and hire another intern to do the same all over again. 

At the end of the day Interns are young and unaware and are used by large corporations to increase revenue for middle managers and executives. 

The opportunities are GREAT (don't get me wrong) but often time Interns are given too much responsibility with no compensation or guaranteed position. One mistake can be used to not hire someone.

Later - they want to ""settle"" with the Nice Guy/Beta Provider Schmuck they ignored years ago and coerce/influence him into agreeability and supplication  - not because they TRULY want to, it's because they can no longer attract the men they *actually* desire. 

Most of the reasons men don’t like promiscuous women are outlined in the Original Post/Summary. 

The best reason for this conversation is that it helps men who are unaware and devoid of smart and solid male mentorship, leadership, and guidance. 

The one point of disagreement in the Original Post: 

*...I am assuming that the husband is actually both alpha and hot...*

I don’t see most true Alpha Men creating either lifetime or short-term attachments to known sluts. It’s contrary to Alpha Behavior. 

Regarding N-Count: virgin is best, barring that – a count of one to two is okay…three MAXIMUM, all of which occurred in Long-Term Relationships (LTRs). ANY sex outside of an exclusive relationship is suspect. A lot of women like to say: ""oh…that didn’t count."" That’s a Big NO-GO.

The caveats are as follows: She better be young (ages 18-20-ish), attractive (to the man’s preference), fertile, amenable to his ongoing life-program/goals, and very enthusiastic and dedicated to providing outstanding sex to this man over her lifetime.

"dpsw5t9","It's a bit ridiculous to think that a birthday is some magical thing that suddenly confers the ability to make adult decisions for yourself,

With the ""too drunk to have sex"" you aren't just looking to see whether a person was intoxicated,  you are looking to see whether the person was intoxicated to a point where they were no longer coherent and able to understand their choices and actions. 

My point is that determining how alcohol affects a person's coherency and ability to understand isn't 100% objective. You said,"" Ideally, from a legal standpoint, everyone who has been drinking would have to take a breathalyser to prove they aren't impaired before engaging in sex, but that isn't going to happen."" That's the thing, you aren't just measuring whether they are intoxicated. You are measuring whether they are aware and coherent to understand the nature of their actions. Even a breathalsyer won't tell you that because a person at .10 can be very drunk but still be aware and a person at .04 who is sensible to alcohol can be unaware and incoherent. Because the same amount of alcohol can affect people differently. Behavior and even a breathalyzer isn't 100% objective to determine.   Many men do not ""walk funny"" or ""text funny"" but can wake up the next day and not remember anything.  People who you would think were aware are not. People who you think are trashed are actually aware.  Diagnosing whether somebody is coherent to understand their actions is not like diagnosing somebody to see whether they have the flu or chicken pox. 

How can you know better than me whether I was aware and coherent to understand my choice?  

&gt; It's a bit ridiculous to think that a birthday is some magical thing that suddenly confers the ability to make adult decisions for yourself,

I never said this. But are you arguing that adults can and should never be able to make decisions for themselves? There is a third party hercules who knows better than him/her?

&gt; How do you handle the case of someone consenting and then recanting the next day, claiming they were too impaired to know what they were doing?

I never said it was 100% subjective. I just said it wasn't 100% objective. 

In most of these situations, you are looking to see whether somebody was coherent enough to understand, not the negative.  If I am telling you I *was*. 

Similar to when the prosecution is looking to see whether a person had the intent to kill somebody. It's one thing if the person is denying and the prosecution is looking for objective evidence to prove there was intent.  But what if the person just comes in and says, ""yes, I intended to do it"" it wasn't a mere accident. Does the prosecutor not believe him and look for evidence that he didn't do it on purpose?

Price control and consumer rights. You're not allowed to overcharge someone for a procedure that doesn't cost that much when they're dying. We do this for other sections of the market, and it's better than communism/socialism approach of saying that the government has to care for you.

&gt; 1. Pregnancy continues to be a significant health risk, both physical and mental, even in western nations with modern medical facilities.

Pregnancy doesn't happen spontaneously.  The mother chooses to become pregnant.  It shouldn't be treated as a medical condition.  It's a baby, not cancer.

&gt; 2. As a reasoning, conscious, and healthy person, the mother has much more intrinsic value than her unborn child- who is unaware, unknowing and has a high risk of natural death.

The child doesn't have a high chance of natural death.  The child's risk of death over the next 30, 40, or 50 years is slower than the mother's risk.

Unfortunately Daybreak isn't going to reply or take anything from it because they are just too deep into their delusions. What I think you should do is move on from the game because honestly, it is never going to go back to how it used to be and it will only end up dying, so you're only wasting your time. 

There's a lot of Daybreak fanboys in this subreddit that think the game is perfect and always give you shit whenever you give your opinion on the game and that's all Daybreak wants to see. They think these few morons speak for the majority of the community which they did not, it's just that the other people aren't as vocal. Go read the Reverse AMA, that's where a lot of people shared their opinion and views on the game. The first question which was something along the lines of, ""What is one thing you want to return from PS3?"" was filled with, ""AR-15"", ""old recoil"", ""colors"". The majority of people that posted there wanted things to be reverted and how did Daybreak respond to that? ""We are going to be buffing the ar"". Buffing. That alone shows it is not going to be as good as the old AR, it is only going to be a half assed change that isn't going to make anyone happy.

In conclusion, I think you should move on from this game and just accept its fate. As much as a lot of we wish, a change is not going to come because Daybreak doesn't want that to happen. Just the fact alone that they made such drastic and illogical changes to the game driving it to its current state gets to show how unaware and delusional they are about their game.

Well they saw PUBG's sudden success and they decided that the game was going to try to become as much PUBG as it possibly could.

""Adapt"", people have already adapted to this shithole of a game, they just don't prefer it because it's such a piece of garbage compared to how it used to be.

Historically, Daemon Blackfyre got riddled with arrows, even Aemon the Dragonknight himself got taken out by a couple random Toynes.

For every Rhaegar who gets killed in noble, one-on-one combat against an equal, there's **plenty** of all-time-great fighters who get outnumbered, mobbed, and killed. 

""But he wasn't wearing his plate, that's the inexcusable part!"" - yeah, and he *just* finished reminiscing about how Rhaegar would go hang out with the smallfolk without caring about his own security. Barristan **fucked up**, he was being sentimental and prioritized communing with the people of Meereen above taking precaution while strutting around in a city in the midst of an active guerrilla campaign.  

Even after all that, he killed like 15 guys while he *wasn't* armored, which is a superhuman feat in something like ASOIAF that tries to treat sword fighting in a more grounded way than most fantasy. Someone as fearsome as The Hound struggled against 5 Lannister goons *with* his armor, and Arya backing him up to an extent - Barristan *cleaned up* against much greater odds. 

In the books, I suspect that Barristan is about to get mobbed and killed by Brazen Beasts following their coup in Meereen, as I personally ascribe to the theory that The Shavepate is obviously playing him, and is about to dispose of both Hizdahr and Barristan (an easy patsy). 

* **Dorne is Ultimately Pointless**

The Show version of Dorne basically stands in a uniquely terrible position - it has some of the worst scenes in the entirety of A Game of Thrones, some of the dumbest dialogue, and ultimately served no purpose beyond killing off Myrcella. I don't think that's really up for debate.

Where I'm going to swerve into highly unpopular territory is that I believe the book version of Dorne is equally as useless, if written more cleverly. I see a lot of people praising the intrigue and conspiracies in Dorne, which there's certainly a lot of, but none of them actually lead anywhere meaningful within the scope of the greater plot of ASOIAF, and I think that the end of the Dorne plot in the books is going to be uncomfortably similar to the end of the plot in the show.

Doran gets praised for his Vengeance, Justice, Fire and Blood speech, but his grand conspiracy (so far as we know) culminated in sending his notably weiner-ish son to woo the most powerful woman in all of Essos. Quentyn's chapters were enough of a shaggy dog tale on their own (they can be summarized as ""conditions during war lead to plague, plague is bad, then the dragons broke free""), but even in-universe this is just laughably bad planning.

Seriously, the first time Barristan lays eyes on Quentyn when he shows up with his proposal, Barristan's reaction is basically ""haha look at this fucking weenie trying to marry the Queen of Dragons"". It was **never going to succeed** and even someone who's noted to have a hard time grasping political conspiracies figures that out **the instant the plan is revealed to him**. It took SEVENTEEN YEARS for this plot to come to anything resembling fruition.     

Of course, Arianne (and probably Doran as well following Quentyn's death) are going to latch on to a *different* Targaryen claimant, but this is mere opportunism and the fortune that Arianne is both unwed, firmly against the Throne, and aggressive enough to pursue Aegon on her own accord. This is Oberyn-esque opportunism, not Doran-led plotting. So, at the end of the day, yes, Dorne has relevance to Aegon's plot, but it has taken them forever to get there (SEVENTEEN YEARS of letting their end goal run around Essos unguarded and unaware), and the Dornish plotline — from AFFC up until whenever they link up with Aegon — can be summarized by ""The Dornish Conspire Amongst Themselves"". 

When Aegon loses his Dance against Daenerys, the Dornish will disappear from the rest of the plot just as they have in the show. 

* **There is too much focus on Worldbuilding at the expense of Plot**

This is where I expect to receive the most criticism, since I completely understand that a lot of people enjoy ASOIAF precisely because of its deep world, enormous cast, and layers upon layers of intrigue and foreshadowing, but I am of the opinion that GRRM has become lost in his own garden.

I like Brienne as a character, and I understand why her chapters in AFFC are so well loved by many people, but almost her entire plotline is just killing time in the actual scope of the novels. We, as readers, **know** that she won't find Sansa in the Riverlands. This use of dramatic irony doesn't enhance Brienne's plot at all, since the main thrust of her chapters is instead to explore the horrors of war, but her search for Sansa has been turned into a MacGuffin by this loss of an actual end goal. The plot doesn't actually advance until Brienne encounters Lady Stoneheart.

The above Dorne example is expanding the scope and scale of the world he's written, adding more characters and their associated plots and motivations and fates and *dozens of chapters*, with the end result of *maybe* affecting Aegon or Sam's plotlines. Similar criticisms could be leveled against the Ironborn, although at least most of them have already intersected with the primary plotlines. 

Personally, I prefer AGoT-ASoS significantly over AFFC and ADwD, and I think that this is because nearly every chapter in the earlier novels drives the plot. In the latter two, many of the chapters are essentially filler - finely written and exploring some deeper messages, of course, but filler nonetheless. For an honest question, what do Aeron Greyjoy's chapters actually add that couldn't have been covered by Asha or Victarion's chapters? Are Areo Hotah's chapters actually necessary, or would witnessing the same events from Arianne's point of view be sufficient? 

Does ""Daenerys learns how to rule"" require the exploration of Volantine politics, of the state of Astapor post-battle, or the culture and conflicts of Pentos? Do these additional plot details (Elephants vs. Tigers, the war of Yunkai against Astapor, or the Tattered Prince and whatever conspiracy *he* is involved in) serve to drive Daenerys forwards, or are they simply expanding the scope of Essos?

As a meta-example, the amount of work that GRRM has put into the history of his world seems to have outpaced the amount of work he's putting into the ""present events"" of ASOIAF - he's written, what, a few hundred thousand words for *Fire and Blood*?

&gt; The Republicans are constantly violent and make filing statements and clearly it does not really harm their base. At the end of the day people who vote regularly are still going to vote regularly and if they've only got one of two choices then they're going to make that choice.

The Republicans are constantly violent?  Constantly violent?  Really?  All of them?  Most of them?  How many?

No I think the hard left is getting more violent, not liberals.  Get some reading comprehension skills.

* The needle moved not an inch.

As far as I know neither Antifa nor BLM has changed a single law or regulation when it comes to policing so far.  Not one.

"dmcssdb","Thats why I dont pay much attention to the commenters who replied to me I watch people in the medical communities reaction to these events there is no logical way those were suicides there just is not im sorry.

I have seen drs who are not holistic drs question some of these events. they dont align with logic very well.

These drs are studying gcmaf I dont have time to teach biology however they are studying alternative approaches to treating cancer. The medical industry makes lots of money by people being sick not healthy if these drs like jeff bradstreet whose gunshot wound to the chest was a ""suicide"" cough were studying alternative treatments for cancer people would have everything to gain from that research and the pharmaceutical industry would have a lot to loose. While people die of various causes all of the time people of the same profession studying the same things in such a short span from one another is a completely different story.

Its like JFK was he killed because he was stupid and unaware and just a figurehead or was he creating a problem for the powers that be. If he was a gutless idiot he would have been left alone if mr brad-streets studies and research all meant nothing he would have been left alone. See killing a person lends validity to what they believed and thought and garners a general interest and curiosity for the public. Acts of murder and assassination are only used as a last resort because of what I just mentioned. Whatever Mr Bradstreet was doing in terms of looking for an alternative cure mus have been going somewhere.

Some of the alternative health drs have probably been murdered not because they were making a breakthrough but to send a message to others in the medical community.

Hes saying im not informed on this but tell me why police tried to classify mr bradstreets death as a suicide when it is VERY obvious thats BS.

It seems to me often times idiots are left alone and the people who are truly on to something are killed. Its because one poses a risk and one does not that's just the truth.

Lets pretend slavery was still a thing right. you have 100 slaves all who have become accustomed to slavery and think it is the natural way of life. You have the master profiting from these slaves right but of those 100 slaves you have one who starts to question if this is really how things were intended to be. Slowly that slave starts provoking thought from some of the others and teaching them how to escape and think about if it makes sense for them to all be slaves. If they all escape masters profits go away master rules over nobody and master will actually have to get up off his ass and do his own work for a living. So the masters solution is to stop the conscious slave from spreading that conscious to the others for if the others were to come to know of and learn the truth it would create problems. So Masters task is to brand the dissenter slave as crazy get the others to think there is something wrong with them and then show a consequence to stop the others from ""getting any ideas"".

So that slave is killed and it sends a message to the rest and stops them from teaching others. Some will say the slave was crazy, maybe but if it was nonsense they would not have been killed.

The other slaves say well nothings happened to me but those ones think their enslavement is natural and that is the way it is meant to be nothing happened to them because they do not interfere with the masters plans.

So when you read history books and look into the past or into people who spoke out and were killed or were looking into something and were killed thats the trail you want to follow. It means whatever they were killed in the process of studying or researching may have been real for if it wasnt whoever had them killed would not have felt threatened by their research.

Like monica peterson. These people are smart and they know killing somebody provokes people to do more digging asking more questions and makes them more believable it is only done when the person in question is hot on the trails of the truth and cant be manipulated like JFK. 

Were some of the drs deaths natural causes its likely but do the ""suicides"" that started occurring in june 2015 make any type of sense? no they dont that is probably why 300 fake accounts were created to attack the drs with REAL accounts who simply wanted answers.

You may be able to convince me some of the deaths were of normal causes but not the more crucial ones not the ones that started this conversation. If they were truly suicides somebody does not go out of their way to make 300 fake accounts to shut down basic questions.

I was skeptical at first as well because I can only take the news as its reported to me I wasn't their when the dr was murdered I didnt perform the autopsy etc however what I do have is attention to detail and the ability to apply logic. It was to be honest when I saw not speculated or had told to me by somebody else when I saw over 300 fake profiles ALL of which had the time and creation dates within short spans from each-other all attack the drs asking questions who had accounts for years etc that opened my eyes because all you need is common sense to see that is odd.

When people are attempted to be silenced it makes me listen to them more had those 300 fake accounts not come out of the woodwork to attack I may have still been on the fence but seeing how that was orchestrated instantly came to my attention. In fact I made an account and pointed it out and then the attacks started to fade because I pointed out to everyone hey look all these accounts saying people with questions are tin foil wearing crazies are fake and were literally ALL just made a few hours apart at most and ALL the ones with thoughtful intelligent questions had pictures with drs who verified their credentials etc hmmm interesting.

Like I said we think drs are smart enough to cut open our bodies and risk killing us to do surgery on us but dont think they are smart enough to recognize foul play? mmmhm very interesting you can trust these people with your lives but not trust their judgement that their colleagues are being murdered? everyone can believe what they like I guess.",1504140134,"its like jfk was he killed because he was stupid and unaware and just a figurehead or was he creating a problem for the powers that be.","stupid and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"stupid and unaware","stupid",NA,NA,0

"dm2olit","**4x4: Panama**

Panama is a super fun season. I'm not going to pretend it's incredibly deep (although it does have some great character arcs) but it's just a shitton of fun with Casaya dominating the post-merge and wacky situations and conversations happening every episode. Plus Terry's immunity streak gives it some much needed tension and it does feel like you can pick a side and root for it while both sides get complexity, which is nice. It's a great season. I rank it 8/34.

**4x: Cirie, Shane, Courtney**

Generally considered the 3 main stars of Panama and the people that make it the season it is, it's no surprise that these three have made it to the panama top 4, and the top 50 every rankdown.

Cirie is the most universally liked character and player in Survivor history, and Panama Cirie is her at her finest. She gets the growth arc of Kathy with her own unique twist on it, with her giggle and her dry commentary at how crazy her tribe is. The season really wouldn't be the same without her, Survivor wouldn't be the same without her, she's a proud member of my personal top 10 and is probably a proud member of almost everyone's.

Shane is well known for being one of the craziest and most entertaining people in Survivor history. Between his rants, his nicotine withdrawl, and the way everyone plays around him he's a once in a lifetime character. Personally Shane kind of annoys me and I'm not sure he'd even be in my top 100, but I can see the value of his character and once I rewatch this season I might end up loving him again.

Courtney does not have the status as the other people in the Panama endgame, but in terms of sheer entertainment value she's  one of the best survivor characters ever. The fact that they actually found this fire-dancing hippie who manages to be one of the most unaware and annoying people in history and cast on survivor is amazing. She delievers so much without even trying, and she has quite possibly the greatest jury speech in Survivor history after snakes and rats. Great, great character.

**3x: Aras**

Aras has done pretty well in rankdowns aside from his lowly placement in SR1 due to SURM's love of Terry. There's a bit of contraversy with Aras if he's actually an entertaining winner critical to the success of Casaya and the season, or if he's just boring and it's a letdown that he won with all the wild personalities in Panama. Personally I like Aras a lot so I'm on the first side. I think he's critical to the success of the season by keeping Casaya focused and together and helping them win the challenges, I love his rivarly with Terry, and I think he's also weirder and more entertaining than a lot of people give him credit for (traits that unfortunately did not transfer over into his dull BvW apperance.) I don't expect him to keep making top 4 in every rankdown but it's nice that he has done so a lot.

**2x: N/A**

**1x: Tina** 

Tina's apperance in the Panama top 4 in SR1 was a result of the epic Aras vs Terry wars that were had, with SURM cutting Casaya members early and other rankers cutting La Mina early, leaving Tina to avoid the crossfire and make it all to the F4. Still, I don't begrudge her making it, she's easily the best first boot of all time with a story that actually makes me emotional just thinking about it. As great as Cirie is, I do wonder what would have happened if Tina had made it farther and became more of a figure in Survivor lore, she's an amazing woman.

Future possibilites: Can you believe SR4 is the first time Terry's even ranked in the top 200? I could see him making a F4 but there are always people who are going to be very anti-Terry so it's doubtful. No one else really has a chance; Bruce is fun but he's always going to leave in the 100-150 range as just a side character, and Danielle making 76(!) in this rankdown is really, really high and I can't see her ever replicating that performance again.

"dlhcwzw","A lot of these can be answered with book speculation. 

1. The White Walkers were looking for someone in particular. They found a NW Lord who looked all fancy, so they tested to see if they had the right guy. Apparently the WW know about someone who is supposed to be able to defeat them. If I recall this specific theory correctly, they also knew he'd look like a Stark, and that one former lord may have had Stark blood in him. One defining characteristic is that he'd have a sword that wouldn't shatter when making contact with the WW swords, ie. a Valyrian Steel sword. Remember when the NK stood at the top of the cliff at Hardhome and watched Jon duel the WW? That may have been him scouting for his foe.

2. Here's a place where the books don't match up with the show. In the books, the NK is not the first White Walker. There's a legend concerning the Night King. I think he was either a Stark Lord of Winterfell or a Stark Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. He then fell in love with a female WW who turned him into a WW himself, and then he ruled over the north for some time or something like that. 
Its apparent that the WW have some breeding mechanism that allows them to turn currently living humans into WWs. Whether the CotF just made one WW who turned others, or they made a bunch is unclear, and kind of irrelevant tbh.
As for their home, in the far far north is a place called the Land of Always Winter. Bran visited it in the books while he was in his dream coma after Jaime pushed him out of the window. I think its assumed the WW just hang out here when they aren't murdering wildlings.

3. What caused the WW to rise is unclear. Theories include a broken pact between the First men and the CotF, the Starks and the CotF, or the Starks and the WW, etc. Some people believe it has to do with the Andals coming and cutting down the forests and the weir trees. Others think it has to do with the Andal religion of the Seven gaining prominence. Some think the Starks had a secret deal with someone, the details of which was passed along the lords of winterfell, but after Rickon and Brandon Stark were simultaneously murdered, the secret died with them, leaving Ned Stark unaware and unable to do whatever he needed to do to prevent the rise of the WW. It may also have to do with the fact that Robb was named in the Light of the Seven, or that Ned built a sept in Winterfell.
I like the secret Ned deal, but I think what is most likely is the simplest answer: The seasons of Westeros are unusual and erratic, but cyclical. A long night was going to come and when the long night comes, so do the WW. But this begs the question: What came first? The WW or winter? Does the sheer presence of WW cause it to be winter, or does the fact that its winter allow the WW to come? This is unknown.

4. Their end goal seems to be either the eradication of all of humanity or just the eradication of the first men.

5. The true relationship between the WW and the wights is unknown. I know that ice wights are similar in concept to fire wights, like Jon or Berric Dondarion, and I'm pretty sure they aren't linked to the person who brought them back. For instance, if Mel dies, I doubt that Jon would die too. So I think in the context of the books, the ice wights probably won't die as well if and when the WW die. They might cease to be a cohesive force, but we do know that wights were murderous and targeted the LC of the NW outside of WW influence before. In the show though, I wouldn't be surprised if this is reversed, just to simplify the ending. But then that makes you wonder if the show will show the end of all the WW? Will this war for dawn kill off the remaining WW population, or will they just be broken and flee home in defeat?

I'm nervous, scared, and mad at myself.  But, when asked what happened I owned up to it, admitted my mistake, and told my boss it will not happen again.  Instead of getting depressed over how I failed, I'm using this as a lesson, I need to be more careful, especially when doing the thing I messed up.  Even if I get fired, I'll carry that lesson with me to my next job.  I can't afford to focus on that failure, because if I do, I'll definitely end up making things worse, by being distracted at work and messing more things up.  So, I got yelled at, I made my case, and now I have to force myself to move on.  I'm in a really shitty mood, but I'm going to keep trying to cheer myself up, because I know being miserable about it all day isn't going to do me any good.

That's what I mean when I say that you need to learn from your mistakes and failures instead of focusing on them.  I failed, in a big way.  But I figured out where I went wrong and now I'm going to make sure it won't happen again.

You can do this too.  It takes a long time to change the way you think, though.  I was your age when I saw my therapist and it didn't really click for me until my 20's.

Okay yeah this wasn't about time jumps but what doesn't make sense about getting your ass kicked back to back when you came in expecting an easy win? 


&gt;I know we're in a bit of a rush to get to the end of the season what with only 7 episodes total and all but does the total lack of recon on Team Dany's part annoy anyone else? I mean, we have the Greyjoys at sea, Spider on land/in King's Landing and Dragons for the sky, she could have had pin points on every major movement and prevented herself from this pretty stunning defeat if she'd been a bit more cautious. Thoughts?




Let's break it down. 

Greyjoys at sea - The inferior naval Greyjoy force of the two, most of which is being used to courier around diplomats leading up to the battle. Sitting back on their heels granted not as prepared for battle as they should be. Also probably unaware and unprepared for Euron's fleet considering they stole his best ships and fled.

Spider on land/Kings Landing​. - Varys has been making back door deals and alliances with the other kingdoms all across Westeros. We've seen that his little birds have been turned by Qyburn in the s6 finale. He doesn't have the intel he thinks he does. 

Dragons - these aren't predator drones we're talking about flying at 30,000 feet undetectable from enemy radar. They're dragons. Sure they can be used to certain tactical advantages but they aren't COD UAVs. 


I would agree her naval strategies could have been better prepared but I don't think that blame falls on her as this is pretty much the first time she's ever been on a ship before that she was old enough to remember. Yeah do I hate the way things are going for Dany right now? Absolutely. Fuck Cersei. But there also wouldn't be much of a show either if Dany just floated in and waltzed over Kings Landing, although it would have been pretty sweet had she done so. I for one​would have enjoyed it.

"dkrugf4","I'd like to see reddit handle a few of your points since it can tend to take equality to an almost offensive level of militantness and moralizing. I'd like to see reddit put up.

As far as your view, I don't have answers for issues on brain volume and crime despite wealth.

What I do see, though, is a problem with your level of resolution and, in some cases, spurious relationships. For example, implicitly connecting moral behavior to intelligence, and intelligence to IQ and brain volume. There's a lot more going on in a brain than size and horsepower when it comes to intelligence, and even more when it comes to morality. Germany in the horrific World Wars is the classical parable of extremely high and immoral intelligence. If they had iPods, they'd be listening to Bach on their way to their job of industrially slaughtering Jews like hogs.

Also to a certain degree, the tools we use suit us. IQ tests applied to other cultures assumes the test is completely universal and human, without a cultural subtext. We're often unaware and very romantic about our subtexts like that. I'd be highly suspect of any universal ""human standard"" developed by anybody. It's just our version of walking on hot coals to test bravery with extra.. ahem...steps.

Second, physical appearance is really superficial, which is the problem, and why I'd suspect the brain volume thing (which, if true, is pointing towards a nutrition epidemic). Where species differences really count are in the genes, and genetically you're indistinguishable from a woman in the Congo in 83 BCE. Humans are very closely related, even closer than a family of chimps. You're more genetically identical to our ancient Congolese woman than two chimp brothers.

So any genetic superiority would be like between two brothers: Greedy, overly particular and petty. Frankly that's what we've found this very new idea of racism to be, and nothing more.

I think you should change your view by virtue of the fact that you so badly want to. You know, the facts don't judge, and people make of them what they will. Arguments can be very powerful at times and certain points very subtly tempting and testing our resolve, but you can just say no to it. We have a hand in creating information, it's like a language. Just because bad words and curses exist doesn't mean you have to hear them if you really don't want to. So just reject these racist arguments because they're not good enough for you.

I mean they're also wrong, but respect your gut. Information hasn't ""outsmarted man"" that we need to justify ourselves to ideas. We owe a debt of honesty to ourselves but sometimes that includes your gut, which has informed you that the information supporting racism is wrong.

"dk16wi6","I haven't really ever talked about this publicly or outside my inner circle of friends. I have a rare mutation in my DNA with my RYR1 receptor. First noticed symptoms at age 13 (31 now). My symptoms are extreme muscle cramping for extended periods of time which then progresses to Rhabdomyolysis and then in this case progressed further to Compartment Syndrome and legs had actually began to die. The muscle tissue was early stages of necrosis. Timeline for this episode was about 3 days and I was in the USA (palm desert) for a trip with friends, we are canadian. Cramps started off lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour on day 1. Day 2 I woke up and had an extremely painful cramp in both legs that last about 1 hr. I had to kneel beside the bed and bend over the mattress as it was the only thing that provided any relief. My friend called me an ambulance. I was crying at this point and trust me I don't cry often. My CK levels (Creatine Kinase) where in the 20k-25k range and after several bags of saline and some pain meds I was discharged. The next morning I woke up and my legs instantly started cramping or they were cramping and woke me. Called an ambulance right away this time. Once admitted my CK is tested once more and it's now in the 30,000 plus range. Saline is doing now to help. At some point that day my legs start cramping and harder than they have at any point in my life so far. The pain is intolerable. They were injecting me with Fentanyl and dilaudid and it was doing anything at all! I keep asking... screaming for more. The pain was so bad at this point it literally fucked with my sense of time, space, life everything. Every second felt like a minute, every minute a day, and that day an eternity. I was exhaling and making a Aaaaahhhhhhh vibration as that feeling was a 0.0001 second distraction from the hell I was in. I was being pulled into the deep water. My life was slipping at this point. I had an extremely elevated heart rate from dealing with the high CK. My liver and kidneys were failing. CK at this point was over 100,000 and my legs had been cramping for over 8 hours.
At this stage a team of surgeons and specialists were frantically trying to decide the best course of action. My mother said she had never seen a situation with doctors arguing about the proper course of action. The major threats I was dealing with was heart failure or Liver and kidney failure. The normal course of action would be to put me on dialysis for 4hrs but my heart rate was too high and 4 hrs was too long of wait and the risk of heart attack was hanging over us. Also because I was youngish they wanted to do everything to save my legs that were pretty much dead at this point but the muscle tissue was savable. If they didn't do enough dialysis the surgery was too risky. So they opted for 2 hrs of dialysis and then got me into surgery. At this point I am unconscious and unaware and this part was told to me by my mother. Doctors gave both my situations around surviving slightly over 50-50 and about a 50-50 chance I would wake up with my legs. This was uncharted territory for them. So the first surgery went well. They made the incisions through the skin and fascia and allowed the pressure in the compartments to release. They covered them so I couldn't see because I left like that with my muscle out for about 36hours to allow the decompression. The second surgery was to clean the tissue and put everything back in and take some grafts for the wounds. They covered them for 5 days with wound vacs and keep me well lubed on a pain pump. I was in the ICU as well so the level of care was very good. I was still not out of the woods yet as my liver and kidneys were still not fully bouncing back after the beating they took. Luckily 2 or 3 days after surgery they show positive signs. On day 5 they remove the wound vacs and check how the grafts are doing and to determine if any additional surgery would be required. I was lucky and both leg grafts took 100%. I spent the next two weeks in the American hospital as they argued with the insurance companies on when I was save to fly home. Insurance assholes tried to get me shipped home in between surgeries to finish it off in Canada and my surgeon had to actually call them himself and say that was the stupidest most incompetent thing he had ever heard. I was touch and go and they wanted to fly me home? It was stressful to say the least. After about 20 total days in hospital I was flown back to Vancouver Canada and admitted to a local hospital.
The rest of the story is longer and longer than this but at least for now my condition has somewhat stabilized and I have returned to a normal life for the most part. My grafts are doing great and my legs too. Every now and then I do something to aggravate them but I have to live my life as well. I was extremely lucky to have a family and friends that love me and supported me the whole way. My mom was by my side the whole way like a momma bear would. Unfortunately my father had passed away in 2001 but his brother, my uncle, was by my side too and that made a huge difference. We are only here for a minute so enjoy it everyone.

We know Danny isn't the only one that has the shining gift (like shining light onto evil to reveal evil's presence). He's a child, so I took it as Tony os his made up friend to justify the visions he receives because he doesn't understand it fully. The other person with this gift is the guy who works at the hotel. 

The movie brings up Danny's arm injury a couple times that resulted from Jack drinking. Jack swears he never touched Danny and wouldnt ever harm a hair on his head. So does Jack have an evil spirit possessing him? He loves his wife and boy, but he dreams of killing them. He always seems unaware and vulnerable to possession when he lets his guard down.

The Overlook Hotel (which always thought was named to hint that this hotel ""watches over"", or is overlooking the spirit world, in a good vs evil kind of way) is a bit of a nuetral spirit that tractions evil spirits to its premises aling with the mortals who can fend off the spirits and battle the evil spirits. In a sense, the Overlook Hotel is a dream catcher. 

The man who works at the Hotel is old enough in the film to have been witness to the previous dealings and murders. Perhaps, good and evil have fought before and the evil spirits have always won. The resort is somewhat corporatized showing a conquering of Native American's mountain land. There are several references around the hotel that depict a Native culture. Sometimes Good wins, someti.es Evil wins. But the hotel attracts this spiritual battle because people who cannot shine, are ignorant to their reality. Danny's mother believes his injury was accidebtal ir negligence, but a greater more evil being exists in Jack. Perhaps this is why he drinks? Alcohol is Jack's grown up version of Tony that helps him unserstand in the only way he can.

And perhaps, Jack was never there before, but the spirit that possesses him was, and that spirit became trapped in the hotel along with all the other spirits of the Overlook Hotel. Jack became a mortal piece of that hotel's history because his demon led him their as the evil spirit(s) did for all the others. 

The Overlook Hotel is protected by good spirits, but evil seeks to destroy what is good, resulting in history repeating itself forever.

"djkmr10","5 June 2017

Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington has become the site of a reactionary, racialist campaign against biology professor Bret Weinstein, after he spoke out against a college-sponsored event that called for all white students and faculty to leave the school grounds for a day.

The event was a twist on a school tradition known as “A Day of Absence,” in which minority students and faculty are given the option to leave campus for two days of organized events and workshops focused on issues of racial justice and oppression. This year, organizers chose to reverse the formula. Instead, they “invited” all white students, staff and faculty to stay off the campus for the day’s activities.

Rashida Love, the Director of First Peoples Multicultural Advising Services—the main organizer—wrote in an email to college staff that the event would “[reaffirm] the value of having POC [people of color] in higher education.”

Professor Bret Weinstein voiced his opposition in March, in an email reply to all the faculty and staff, which has now been widely publicized.

The email became a focus during demonstrations on May 23, called to protest alleged racism on the Evergreen campus. A group of about 50 students disrupted Weinstein’s class over the email, which they falsely claimed was racist. The protesters shouted obscenities at the professor yelling, “You’re supporting white supremacy!” and “Stop telling people of color they are fking useless. You are useless, get the fk out”.

A video of the event shows Weinstein calmly trying to explain his position to the students. At one point, he tries to respond to a question from the barrage of students asking, “Do you want to hear the answer or not?” The group of students shouts back, “No!” The students then assert that he has lost his right to speak, citing specifically his “white privilege.”

Professor Weinstein is not a right-wing professor. His views are, broadly, left-wing. He opposed the campaign of Hillary Clinton in favor of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election. Many of Weinstein’s students, and students at other schools who have only heard of the events, defended him and have since spoken out against the protests.

In the email which the students have used to call for his resignation, Weinstein stresses certain basic democratic conceptions:

“[T]here is a huge difference between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves from a shared space in order to highlight their vital and under-appreciated roles… and a group or coalition encouraging another group to go away. The first is a forceful call to consciousness.... the second is a show of force and an act of oppression in and of itself.”

He added, “On a college campus, one’s right to speak—or to be—must never be based on skin color.” At the end of the email, Weinstein offers to take part in the event by providing a public presentation on the subject of race from a scientific perspective, to which “everyone would be equally welcomed.”

The second accusation against Weinstein is focused on his criticism of a program introduced by the college president, George Bridges, called the “Equity Agenda,” which among other things requires that every faculty hire has an “equity justification.” What this means in real terms is that the hiring of professors will be based on identity rather than knowledge of their field. Weinstein opposed the new program because he was concerned that race would take precedence over all other considerations.

There is nothing “left” or progressive in the actions of the students protesting Weinstein. Their racialist outlook expresses the interests of privileged sections of the upper middle class, and complements the racism of the far-right. Their claim that the campus is seething with racial tensions is not supported by any concrete evidence. There have been no reports of openly racist events or groups on campus.

None of their demands address the burning issues affecting the millions of working class people of all races and genders. They have nothing to say about the burden of student debt, food insecurity, poverty and unemployment.

The exact composition of the organizations involved in the protests is unclear. There have been reports of “coalitions” of different organizations. In many of the pictures circulating online, students can be seen wearing shirts with “Socialistworker.org” on the backs, indicating they are with the International Socialist Organization (ISO). There is also a chapter of Socialist Alternative (SA) on the campus. The involvement of the ISO and SA in this event would come as no surprise. Both organizations heavily promote identity politics. The ISO and the SA have remained silent on the Evergreen State events. Neither organization has responded to WSWS requests for a statement as of this writing.

The school administration has played a predictably cowardly role. In his first address to the protesting students on May 26, Bridges opposed the demand that Weinstein be fired, but praised the student action, “We are grateful to the courageous students who have voiced their concerns.” The extent of his “defense” of the accused staff was one line assuring that their jobs were safe.

In a commentary published in the Wall Street Journal, Weinstein pointed to the ideological roots of the protests and their connection to postmodernism. “The protests resulted from a tension that has existed throughout the entire American academy for decades: The button-down empirical and deductive fields, including all the hard sciences, have lived side by side with ‘critical theory,’ postmodernism and its perception-based relatives.” He adds later, “Mr. Bridges tampered with the delicate balance between the sciences and humanities by, in effect, arming the postmoderns.”

The protests at Evergreen are part of a broader trend. Racialist politics is systematically promoted by the media and the political establishment, particularly the Democratic Party, as part of an effort to divide workers of different races against each other, while subordinating the working class to the competition of factions of the upper middle class for access to privilege and power.

Just this week, the New York Times praised Harvard University’s new practice of holding separate graduation ceremonies for different “identities,” specifically sexual orientation and race. These ceremonies, writes the Times, allow the commencement speakers to concentrate on more personal issues such as “the struggle to be black at Harvard.”

In 2015, there was a wave of protests starting at University of Missouri, later spreading to Yale University, Ithaca College, and Amherst College, focused on allegations of racism and racial insensitivity on the part of college administrators. The protests, which fit comfortably within the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, made similar demands that certain professors and administrators be fired, some of which were met.

The protests at Yale were particularly reactionary, focused on calls for the resignation of professor Erika Christakis, a lecturer in early childhood development, who questioned a memo sent by the university on “culturally unaware and insensitive” Halloween costumes. Christakis ultimately decided not to continue teaching courses at the university.

"djikwrl","2: Neleh Dennis - Neleh is who I attribute most to the huge power shift in the early merge of Maraamu. She’s able to flip Paschal, and allows the underdogs to flip the script, voting out John. You’d never expect this of course, she starts as the cute girl who has a father/daughter relationship with Paschal, says “oh my heck”, is “Pixie” or “sweet pea”, and while that’s a nice positive presence, like an Elisabeth, that’s not great. Once John votes out Gabe, Neleh starts to question what’s going on, but when the merge hits, during the Rob boot, the sweet Neleh, Paschal (and Kathy) flip back to the Rotu 4, but when her thoughts are confirmed of the pecking order, she flips Paschal and herself, ending the Rotu 4. She’s still shown as the young girl in moments like offering a chewed mint, and is annoying to the tribe. Her relationship with Paschal ends when he draws the rock, and Neleh is devastated and sad, continues on, taking a deal with Vecepia, voting out Kathy. Then, fitting of the young girl who doesn’t really know how to articulate what she did, she talks about love, being nice, not owning what she did, being very sweet and not being very good in general at FTC. 

Overall Ranking: 27/615

1: Kathy Vavrick O’Brien - Kathy is the first, and best iteration of the person who’s breaking down out there, has a recovery, and goes on to place very well, and be a serious threat. I’m mixed on the archetype as a whole, but Kathy is great. She’s not self aware at all, comes off like a crazy person, she tries to become a leader, is seen as overbearing. She gets frustrated because no one likes her, and ends up being a lone wolf, doing everything by herself, not connecting, she’s just too independent and abrasive for her own good. At the swap, she starts getting it together better, forming a bond with Gina, and with Neleh and Paschal, and she gets chosen to be the merge representative with Rob, where she bonds with him over beer, talks about life, and sets up the rest of the game. She tries to convince the non-Rotu 4 Rotu’s to flip, but it takes Rotu 4 itself to convince them. During the family visit, her son comes out, and we go back to old unaware Kathy, where her son feels so uncomfortable with his mother acting like that. She’s become a key part of the remaining 5, the middle person, but ultimately sticks with her original group, Neleh and Paschal, flips back and votes with Vee on Neleh, forcing the rock draw. Then, just about as she’s going to get her arc completed, she gets betrayed at the last minute, Neleh wins FIC, and votes Kathy out. Her personality is also great, not just unaware and crazy early Kathy, but just the way she speaks, her intelligence yet odd phrases and weird laugh.

&gt;Dear John:



&gt;Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens
United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. **Silly us; turns out that money
isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the
electoral process.** Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats
and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas,
free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and
running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw
celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its
time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development
pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are
dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general?
Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump,
Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the
poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the
conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all
been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire
to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains
strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands
some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging.



&gt;Rubio's press conference yesterday AM was good and should be repeated in its
entirety, not just in nibbles. I will attend the Clinton fundraiser here
next week but as I can only afford the low level of participation may just
get to wave without a ""hello.""

I'm not as salty about the fact that you can't one shot higher level targets. Think of it this way, logically. If they're higher level than you, they're more experienced. If they're more experienced, it's entirely plausible for them to be able to anticipate and react to a hidden blade assassination attempt, and prevent it from happening. Just because you're attacking out of stealth doesn't mean your target will always be completely unaware and unable to respond - with quick enough response, it is possible to avoid being killed by a sneak attack. 

You can actually see it in the first target they try to assassinate ... in the 2-3 seconds it takes for Bayek to bring his hidden blade up to the targets head, the target is ready to block the attack with their arm.

"ditaypz","Okay, let's do this:

&gt;The most powerful Riverlander Houses would be behind the Throne. It doesn't matter if a few minor houses have other sentiments, they'll keep in line if the Houses with the most men and money are on one side.

But they didn't. When house Tully declared for the rebels and got the support of Blackwoods and Mallisters and Brackens and several other houses in Riverlands, houses Mooton, Darry and Whent still went and supported Targaryens, as in actually fought in battles for them to the bitter end. House Frey, which is one of the biggest houses in Riverlands despite all the mockery, didn't fight for anybody and waited until the end of Battle of the Trident, to come and declare for the winner. They again, didn't give two shits about Tullys during WOT5K, only supported Starks thanks to promises of exorbitant rewards, and jumped ship the moment that promise was broken.

&gt;The Florents were Stannis' staunchest supporters in the War of Five Kings.

After Renly died. They supported Renly when he lived. And house Tyrell supported Renly because he would make Margaery queen. There is no such situation here. Would house Tyrell support Baratheons because of their so called ties to Renly? Maybe. Or maybe they would decide to sit this one out. Baratheons stick one to them by marrying Florents, one of their fiercest rivals, maybe Tyrells will think it is better to side with Dany over Baratheons, she can marry Loras (Willas in the books) making him king, and could kick Florents to the curb. Hightower took an easy bet in Renly. It is not so against Dany. They are the most powerful family in Reach, not Tyrells, they may just as well decide to sit this one out, especially since they have no ties and no debts to Baratheons. 

Houses in Reach all want more, Renly promised them that, Robert doesn't. It was a civil war which meant in return for their loyalty they would be given rewards in detriment to other lords who would be on the losing side. In this scenario, they are fighting for the status quo, no additional gain for any of them. The closest allies of the throne, a.k.a. the ones who will sweep the rewards if there is any, are original rebellion houses, not them. If they side with Dany however, then they get rewarded. And if she loses, meh. Robert doesn't have the power to threaten or dismantle the Reach, especially after a most certainly long and devastating war against dragons. Low risk high reward play is with Dany.

&gt;Because the Ironborn wouldn't have an unawares and unmanned kingdom to attack. 

Except, that's exactly what they would have. The North would be called to fight for Robert, to the south. They would leave their homeland as unaware and undefended as in canon. 

&gt;Nobody helped the Night's Watch because they had much bigger things to think about AKA a civil war.  There is no such concern for the North in this scenario so they could afford to support the Watch more.

In this scenario, they have an even bigger threat to deal with, Starks are in no position to support the NW, they are down south fighting 100k Dothraki and 3 dragons.

&gt;His daughter comes at a time after 15 years of prosperity. The commons loved Robert, and would have no reason to support an usurper. Besides that, the common folk's support mean jack shit. And no, half the realm didn't support the Targs, they literally had four kingdoms against them.

Riverlands, Stormlands, the Vale all had loyalists. In each one of these regions they first had to fight against the ones who were loyalists among them before they could raise against the throne. The only region 100% behind Robert was the North. The Reach alone has 
a bigger army than Stormlands, Riverlands and the North combined. They are ""half the kingdom"". Together with Dorne they were fully behind the throne, as well as all of Crownlands. If you go by ""number of administrative zones"", no, half the kingdom didn't support Targaryens. If you go by actual people, yes half the kingdom supported Targaryens. 

&gt;They absolutely have a concept of nationalism and defending against foreigners, they've done it several times. 

They have never done it. Andals came and conquered them all, washing them over with their religion, all but North and Iron Islands, thanks to kings and lords of First Men bending the knee the moment resistance became too costly. Later Nymeria came and conquered all of Dorne thanks to the support she got from Dornish lords Martells. Aegon was only able to conquer them because they were divided and didn't put up much of a fight, fall like flies at the sight of other's defeat. Kings of the Rock and Reach made a pact to defend their crown. Upon their defeat at Field of Fire, the Reachmen bend the knee, including Hightowers, without a single instance of resistance and King Loren Lannister, the king who just fought against him, also bent the knee without further attempts at resistance. This isn't patriots defending their homeland, this is aristocrats defending their position and the moment they realize price is too big, they throw it. The only region that showed any kind of proper resistance to ""foreign invaders"" was Dorne, and Dorne in this case is at the side of Dany.

&gt;The vassals have no reason to break away from their overlords, especially since many of them backed their overlords in overthrowing the Targs and hitched their wagons to them.

If they turn the cloak, Vassals get all of their lords' shit when they win. Vassals, are also not the front runners of campaigns, so while their lords don't have the option to act like all is cool against Dany, they do have that option, to get out of the war with minimal loss or even with a win. Their lords cannot surrender, but they can, and they can be even rewarded for surrendering before their liege does. That's how wars always work. Most of the lords of Stormlands bent the knee to Joffrey after Blackwater, because they could. They didn't stick with Stannis. Even Florents didn't want to stick with Stannis, but their head suffered a bad case of burned at the stake.

&gt; Who will the Lords fight for? An openhanded king who they've known for so long or a foreign queen (they've never had one and would have no reason to accept one with so many male heirs about) that they've never seen and who leads an army of savages?

They will fight for the one they think  will win. Dany is not a foreign  invader despite all the fandom's attempt of trying to paint her as one. She is a westerosi and the returning monarch, not some random dude. She is the heir of Aegon the Conqueror and one with three dragons. The image she invokes isn't that of an evil outsider, it's Aegon himself, someone all of westeros respects and admires. And they all remember how that conquest went. That will be the perspective they will be looking from. And that open handed king is only open handed to his allies, in this case Houses Stark, Tully, Arryn and Lannister. Those are the pillars of his reign. The others have no gain from him, and actually have a better chance of a profit from Dany.

&gt;Dany can also be utterly screwed by one decisive naval battle, as her forces have no naval experience

Dany is coming with combined fleets of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis. Each of those fleets have more naval experience than lords of westeros other than Iron born. Westeros lords have no battles since Greyjoy rebellion, Essosi Free Cities fight against pirate guilds and one another over trade routes all the time. They also have bigger, stronger ships with fire power. She has the upper hand in a naval warfare.

&gt;Dragons have been killed many times before in Westerosi war.

By other dragons.

&gt;The Dornish bagged one

After over a decade of warfare, someone got a lucky shot to the eye with ballista. Not a reliable, repeatable strategy.

&gt;several were killed in the Dance, using artillery

No they were not. Several chained down dragons inside a closed space were killed by a mob of thousands after an entire night of an attack and one of the dragons finally breaking free and collapsing the ceiling on them. One already dying dragon on the floor was put to rest by getting shot in the eye, another one entangled to the ropes and sails of ships due to the fuck up of its rider and then rider got hit by arrows and the dragon drowned. All weird, nigh impossible to repeat cases that depend on absurd luck.

&gt;Even big volleys of arrows and bolts in large enough volume can have an effect.

No they do not. We have seen this in history over and over again. It doesn't work.

&gt;but she won't be able to send them on independent missions since they have no riders. Meaning that she can't use dragons in multiple operations at the same time, drastically reducing their effectiveness.

She doesn't have to send them to separate missions. And no, it doesn't ""drastically"" reduce their effectiveness. They aren't less effective just because they are in one place. Less than optimal in efficiency, yes, but not less effective.

&gt;There's also the fact that they're still not as big as previous Targ dragons and would be easier to kill.

Easier to kill than ""nigh unkillable"" is ""pretty much unkillable"". That's not a difference that will matter.

&gt;There's also the fact that all of her commanders will be drastically outclassed by the loyalist commanders.

Dothraki has far more battle experience than any lord of westeros and fresher too. The last time lords of westeros saw war was, in this case, more than 15 years ago and they saw at best a total 3 wars in their lifetime, 4 for Tywin. Dothraki see war every six months at the laziest. And on the contrary to the popular belief, they have a wast history of fighting and defeating walled cities, and they especially excel at open battle in fields. Unsullied are the only inexperienced bunch in in Dany's army. At this point even Dany has battle experience and fresher than all of westerosi lords.

"dhtk5ow","The military was crumbling. Despite how the largest economy in the world had effectively turned into a factory of weapon production, the extraterrestrial threat could not be defeated. 

There was something weird about an alien threat that supposedly only had our complete destruction in mind. And while not wanting to reveal it, and potentially lose any will to fight them, we still wanted to exploit it. 

Unlike what any reasonable military strategist would do in their situation. They had not yet destroyed our production of crops and poisoned our soil. They had not yet bombed our factories to stop the production of weapons. And they suffered for it.

They were ignoring sound military strategy that would cause undue harm to civilians and those not directly involved in the fight against them.

You couldn't just reveal to the average man the ways in which these aliens act towards civilians. You couldn't just tell him that this threat had never actually targeted any areas of civilian populations despite how easily it could be crippled us financially.

To maintain sovergnty over our own world, we could not just accept this alien force. Despite their current appearance and actions, there was no guarantee that they ever would maintain this level of empathy.

So the world had to have been put into a scare. We had to get them to believe that these aliens will murder them if they are given the slightest chance. We need every single man woman and child on this planet to believe this as a legitimate threat to their safety.

Those scared to fight would've looked at their kindness and fantasized of a better world that may be able to commit to peace if only we stopped fighting them. But they would only find out how cruel this alien race could be towards them when it was too late.


Years of war went by. Our inability to harm their ships and bases centered in South America, and their lack of willingness to destroy our factories, crops and workers, have left us with a stalemate. On the continent their forces only controlled what was below Texas, and the coalition of world government's only had what was north of Texas.

But the stalemate would be broken. What had been considered before now seemed like the ideal time to execute.

The south Americans have been living cushy lives, unaware and uninspired to take action against what we knew would be a unempathetic and controlling threat if it ever managed to gain a strong foothold in North America.

They were peaceful with the belief that as long as they didn't seek out the enemy, the enemy wouldnt seek them out. Everyone knew this was what was holding us back. 

A plan was being acted out. Certain refugees we received from South America during the start of the war were to be smuggled back to their countries of origin. There, we would provide everything we could to help them propogate​ certain lies that inhabitants other areas around south American, and in the other stronghold in South Asian, were being viscously attacked and murdered on mass.

The plan was to inspire force against the threat from within the areas they had already controlled. It was to get these workers to realize the threat these aliens pose, even if the situations they believed in were not completely accurate.

It worked. Fear swept the continent. Civilians effectively took the roles of militants and fought back. The stores of weapons on the continent from pre war times were finally being used the way we always wanted them to. The aliens were at an inability to reciognize these civilians as threats even when they were being shot point blank by people they've never seen before.

This only lasted a while.

One week afterwards we got news of chemical attacks in South America. Civilians were being targeted. It was as if a switch was flicked and now they had a warrant to let everyone die.

The entire population of South America vanished in about a week. 

Then bombs flew over our heads. To the most densely populated cities. To schools and factories. To whatever could end the war the quickest.

Within 4 months everyone was dead. 

Hey at least we gave it our all.

We fought hard for what we believed in.

Humanity could not have given up hope and submitted to these things. They could have lied to them about their niceness the entire time, they could have had selfish interests in mind.

What you say is not hard to verify either. Take this story from National Propaganda Radio (NPR) - this is the same article on NPR:

July 7, 2016: A Minnesota police officer fatally shot a man in a car with a woman and a child, an official said, and authorities are looking into whether the aftermath was live-streamed in a widely shared Facebook video, which shows a woman in a vehicle with a man whose shirt appears to be soaked in blood telling the camera that ""police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason.""

...

The incident comes as police use of force, particularly against minorities, is back in the national spotlight after the video-recorded fatal shooting earlier this week of 37-year-old Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police. The U.S. Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation Wednesday into the shooting, which took place after Sterling, who was black, scuffled with two white police officers on the pavement outside a convenience store.

---------------

It's not so much about making white crime worse, it's about control. 

Edit: You can read many articles about these two shootings on almost any media website and see how they don't describe the Castile shooter (who was hispanic) but always identify the Sterling shooters as white.

"dh3yqr2","&gt; Capitalism requires only a moderate amount of a population to be well educated. Why waste money and resources educating everyone when the country operates fine when many people are not well educated?

&gt; It's incredibly short-sighted but it is a reality for many on the right.

Its funny you should say that.  If it were true, leftist control of the educational system for half a century has ensured we are living the dream.

Thanks to our public schools, half the population of Detroit is functionally illiterate, as are nearly half of its high school graduating classes in recent years.  Detroit has fallen a long way since it had Republican mayors and the highest per-capita income of any major US city.  Many of the country's other major cities (also run by the left for decades) are right behind it.

Thanks to leftist control of our university system, our infantilized college students feel threatened by ideas that are contrary to their worldview, are traumatized by their misinterpretations of other peoples' words, think that their being offended is a license to physically attack people, believe there are 32 genders, and believe that their degree in gender studies is going to be an automatic ticket to a six figure income when they graduate.  

As adults, the graduates of those leftist institutions who have figured out their degree in gender studies isn't worth so much want the rest of us to pay for their bad choices, and think wearing vagina hats makes a statement other than that they are brainwashed drones.

Avoiding libel lawsuits? That's not really as bad as you think. I'd need to see the email for context.

Wow, Hilary's aids. Maybe they were just pissed off?

* Shows they rigged DNC primaries to screw Bernie out of winning the nomination.

Beyond Donna Brazile - how so? There were party politics, I didn't see the emails saying ""Let's rig the primaries"" 

&gt; one of her paid speeches to goldman sachs saying she was ""very far removed from the middle class"". 

Wait what? How could she say it in a speech? ""Hi, my name is Hilary Clinton, I'm very far removed from the middle class, thanks for the money""?

Even if she did, in comparison, she was closer to the middle class than the guy who lives in a gilded penthouse in downtown new york who got a small loan of a million dollars. 

&gt; Needing a ""public and a private position"" on issues

Ooh, like a public and private position on how much golf the president should be playing? Trump said he ""[wouldn't have time for golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMm6PcMIL0)"" while running. Well, look at him now.

&gt;  who exactly is pushing the propaganda here. 

Implication is that Russia leaked false news from made up platforms.

Fox  is full of nuts - do you remember them attacking Obama for wanting [Dijon mustard on his burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAvq12Sa3VE)?

Oh and on notes of substantiated stories - Fox provided a platform for [Trump's birther movement](http://nation.foxnews.com/donald-trump/2011/03/30/trump-obama-maybe-hes-muslim). Also, private investigation.

Snopes and politifacts full answers tend to be very good, even if their simple ruling (tl;dr thing) aren't the most fair. I'd love to read some examples to the contrary with substantiated evidence.

"dg6mqrm","Are you implying that Russia hacked both the DNC and the RNC, or that both were hacked not by Russia, and only the DNC emails were leaked, presumably by Russia? I've seen no evidence to support this, just more of the ""anonymous potential implicated allegations"" type editorials around it, but I suppose its possible. 

Wikileaks, like it or not, does have a 100% record and they did outright say Russia had no involvement with the DNC emails. All indications seem to be that it was an insider leak. Also, seeing as Trump has never been in politics before, anything leaked from the RNC would have had little to do with his campaign, so again not sure how much that could have hurt him anyway. 

There is a large pile of evidence at this point that Trump *was* surveilled, whether by Obama directly or not, if they had incriminating evidence on him you can be DAMN sure it would have been given to the press.... 

The wikileaks emails were extremely damning. T_D is like a constant shitstorm of every-second posts so its hard to go back and find relevant info, and its been a while now, but some ones I particularly remember are:

- shows they rigged the DNC primaries to screw Bernie out of winning the nomination
- one of her paid speeches to goldman sachs saying she was ""very far removed from the middle class""
- needing a ""public and a private position"" on issues

There's a lot of them and its hard to go back and find specifics now, but I'll probably dig through some old reddit posts tonight just as a refresher... 

As far as propaganda, who exactly is pushing the propaganda here? You have all of the typical mainstream media outlets, except fox, who were shown through the email leaks as well as their journalism to be blatantly, and I mean *blatantly* pushing for a Clinton win, some even cheating in the process and interfering with the democratic process, all giving the same story. That would be fine if it was a substantiated story - but its been 6 months now and they've provided ZERO cited factual evidence for any claims. These are the same outlets that wrote hit piece after hit piece after 98% poll after 99% poll in the build up to the election - when do you start to question their validity when they're capable of being SO wrong? You have ""reputable fact checkers"" (lol) like ""Snopes"" and ""Politifact"" now being pushed by google and facebook as ""arbiters of truth"" - those sites couldn't possibly be more biased, and there are plenty of infographics on reddit to prove it - there is certainly a lot of propaganda out there, but unfortunately its not quite coming from where you think it is.

Wood and Wagner both wanted Walken.  

Walken ended up with Wagner. Wood was jealous and despondent.

Drunk, she took her own life, stumbling around and bruising her lower extremities.

Walken and Wagner were embarrassed and angry because they were getting busy with each other.

The dinghy wasn't used because she got in it and let it go, and it floated away in the dark. She could have tried to swim back to the yacht, or she let herself drown.


Drunk people, as I have seen, can be incredibly unaware and stupid.

**Edited to add: I don't get the down votes. They were doing something that they obviously were not willing to talk about, or they (one or both) murdered her. Either they were negligent for a very good reason and did not wish to tell the world while a woman they both liked ended up drowning, or they murdered/compliant in her murder.

But because I said they were mutually attracted to each other at a time where being in a tryst like this would end careers, I get down voted? 

It's my opinion. I had no idea this was a rumour.

So, fine then. Remove the homosexual tryst and cause for her to go into the dinghy.  Say they were doing mountains of blow. Or were finger painting. I don't care. I think there was an argument, they went off to play Pong, and she retired, in her drunken state, to do something she shouldn't have.

The real mystery is what they were doing, if they weren't killing her.

"dfyp8ws","&gt;G2A could give devs an api to remove keys with

That is decidedly too late. At that point the key is already stolen, the charge made to the stolen CC, and the charge-back initiated, causing cost to the devs. All that this does is reduce the incentive to steal keys slightly, because it isn't AS easy to sell them.

Maybe you aren't really aware what the issue is. It isn't ""lost money from fraudulent sale"". It is ""If someone pays us with a stolen credit card, on top of NOT getting the money, we have to pay the bank a penalty that is ridiculously as high as ANOTHER copy of the game. For any stolen copy they have to sell another legitimate copy just to break even."" Or put differently, they would be ecstatic if the game was JUST pirated instead, that way they would JUST not have a sale, instead of no sale + charge-back fee.

The only measure the devs could take would be to create a delay between a purchase and handing out the key, which is obviously not going to happen.

Or maybe, just maybe, banks shouldn't be allowed to have charge-back mechanisms that means that the bank has NO incentive to fix a broken system and just charges the companies that need to accept CC's for the outcome of their lacking security.
If the BANK hat to eat the cost, new security mechanism would be in place TOMORROW. There isn't even a requirement for 2way authentication, which would be the LEAST that would have to be done to increase security. Just having both the customer and the bank not be part of the penalty and have sellers of all kinds of goods pay the tab for CC fraud is what causes this issue.

The companies themselves have NO mechanism to defend against this, and the banks no interest in fixing it. The customer is unaware and just happy to be able to charge-back even in cases where ultimately their irresponsibility caused the theft.

""Fixing"" G2A doesn't fix the issue, since they are by far not the only people selling stolen keys.
Again, I am not against holding G2A accountable, specifically when they claim they are legit now.

To find, yes, but to assert yourself with no other basis than your presumed sense of authority over the matter, no. He's presenting a will-violation double bind on the assertion that he knows rationality best, which is abusive, coercive, and false.

""As for the assertion 'masturbating to porn is cheating', I think that is actually an empirical claim that can be tested in the real world.""

No it can't. Cheating is based on individual values, not specific action. It's not universal. It's different for everyone. That's why its a conversation, and subsequent honoring of individuals will and boundaries. It's cheating when she draws that line for her relationship involvement, and he willfully and contemptuously violates it knowing this.

""I doubt that masturbating to porn very often leads to emotional distance between couples.""

Just wow to this. Porn use has been cited in a majority of divorces. It's been proven time and time again to be a detriment to relationships, not on the basis of what it inherently is, but by people not being able to control themselves (it works with the addiction part of the brain) and relationship boundaries going dishonored. Porn is not bad, but it's widely known and accepting that it's use by individuals is very often a problem with other relationship agreements. This whole post is an example of it leading to emotional distance between couples.

""If people were to only operate on the beliefs they could scientifically prove, society would fall apart very quickly from general inaction.""

Technically, nothing is able to be scientifically proven. Scientific methodology to discover anything is always based on a principle of an irrational concept. Physics isn't even technically solid (pun intended). Quantum physics disproves our entire truth-seeking foundationary principles. 

What can be determined here? She said no. It doesn't matter if she said no because he had a grey hair, or because he's a zodiac sign she doesn't prefer. She has a right to say no for whatever reason she fucking wants. Her right to constitute porn as cheating is not up for fucking debate.

""If he could easily be convicted of rape on that basis, then the majority of married people could be as well. In other words, he could not easily be.""

Again, wrong. He could easily be convicted. Note even the current platform for sexual assault. If someone doesn't want to have sex, but you push through, plead, barter for sex and end up getting compliance when they still didn't technically want it, it's rape. Plain and simple. Even thought the current stats prove the opposite of what you're claiming, and divorce settlements involving claims of sexual assault are nearly always settled with non-disclosures and non-disparagement. Meaning, even more sexual consent and assault issues brought up in divorces proceedings exist than what the public is made aware of, because they are barred from public disclosure. We have a law in the works meant to override this, because people (like yourself) then become unaware and ignorant to a real issue, and it ceases to get traction to get resolved. Awareness will make you more empathetic to the problem.

Maybe now it's appropriate to mention I am an expert on consent and ethics surrounding the sexual aspects of relationships. I am the founder of Consent&gt;Yes, a campaign that works with institutions to develop resources to combat the growing frequency of sexual assault and rape specifically among demographics (of which you might be included) at universities and for the general public.  I have the experience, have objective access to resources and stats pre-media bias, and am qualified on these matters for having used legal and law enforcement contacts to ensure the validity of the logical structure of all materials made. Our newest (and first global) campaign is launching in two months.  

And my guess is, you are probably just a defensive boy who likes porn and has no real concept of OP's fiance's right to dictate the terms of her own participation in relationships. For this, I'm tired and retiring this discussion as I see you as a lost cause.  All I can say is, your beliefs are toxic, and given my experience, you'll likely end up an offender before too long if you don't amend them to respect people's right to determine relationships terms and consent. 

Maybe think on that for a bit. Cheers.

The Way We Are



We are a generation of Gamers. We use technology to dull the past and lull ourselves into a state of complacency. We believe that virtual knowledge can substitute for living experience. In all, we are wrong. For we are meant to become.
It is our overuse of technology  that causes the most damage to our psyche for it allows us to convert Reality into a fantasy world, where we feel in control, master and commander of all within our narrow domain. In Reality, we have isolated ourselves into a state of ignorance, remaining unaware and seemingly unaffected by the Outside world. We ignore the lessons of the past, which might otherwise help us in our decisions for a successful future. As Winston Churchill once stated, “Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.” 
Lulled into this state of pointless complacency, we forget that our lives have an innate power of influence. In order to recognize our power of influence and wield it successfully, we must untether from technology. We must bravely face the vicissitudes unique to every generation, through living experience. It is living experience alone that provides the sensory boost required for all positve, personal growth, that leads to an overall influence for the good of society as a whole.
Once we have untethering from all distracting forms of technogy, searched the past for valuable lessons, and faced the problems of our generation through living experience, only then are we ready and able to weild our power of influence. Through this process alone can our capacity increase to the level where are able to comprehend fully the fact that every choice we make has an inescapable consequence of power. So, we must choose carefully, for our own sake, for the sake of society, and for the sake of future generations. 
We must then be prepared to stand accountable for our choices and their unavoidable consequences. Only then will we be able to incorporate, within ourselves, the significance of Gandhi’s Reality and improve our lives and that of the society into which we are born.

My name is Liberty Hansdotter Singh. For the first thirteen years of my life, I lived in an isolated DormRoom inside of the Trinity BioDome, est. 2289. I was merely one of hundreds of thousands of Students who received their education and life experience connected to an ethereal entity known by us as, “Teacher”. She served as both CourseSupervisor and parental proxy for all enrolled Students.
My biological parents remained camoflagued behind Teacher’s auspices, forcing me to experience a manufactured, conformed, virtual existence, decided upon by their unmistakable caprice. Bound to this inextricable quaranteen, I was chained both physically and mentally.
The Student population was divided into a ClassRoom, each containing five Students who were grouped together according to their level of intelligence, emotional maturity, and social DEP score (Department of Education Perspective).  Upon thorough evaluation of our Learning Index Score, or LIS, we were assigned to a Level and coordinating ClassRoom.  Our mulitple Level education was divided into a two semester SchoolYear. Each Level had a main Learning Objective, and each semester was further divided by a five course cirriculum. Upon acceptable completion of all of the SchoolYear’s courses, we were allowed a brief virtual break, we called the SummerBreak. After the break,  we were advanced to the next Level. 
At the age of thirteen, I was enrolled in Level eleven. The main topic for our Learning Objective was the Twentieth-century. Our courses were: Political Science, Medical Science, History, Foreign Language, and Physical Accuity. Once we had completed all of the course work we were then ready for the SemesterFinal. It was the highlight for the semesters, and was administered to us as a ClassRoom. We always played as a ClassRoom, and it was part of the protocal fun to identify one another during our GamePlay.
The main reason that the SemesterFinal was so exhilerating was because it was transmitted in the GamerPlay Avatar, or GPA, format. The GPA format was a shared virtual experience that allowed us to mentally transform into another person. This person was usually one of historical significance who had been intrical to the course’s historical setting, development and outcome.
As Students we were expected to maneuver successfully throughout the GPA according to our knowledge accumulated throughout the course. Upon exiting the GPA, we were asked to provide an insightsul report of what it was like to “live through” the experience. This report was made by us, typed up in the PGER format, or, Post Gamer Experience Report. We were meant to believe that by “living through” another persons experience, it was the only true way to acquire knowledge. Our PGER was then assessed by Teacher, who gave us a feedback score in the form of a numerical Rank. My ClassRoom of Students maintained the highest Rank for our Level.
Integral to the enhancement of the Gaming experience was “CHIP.” CHIP is an acronym for “Cognitive Hypothalamus Intelligence Proceessor”. Implanted at birth, CHIP was surgically tethered to our brain stem and vagus nerve, thereby greatly amplifying our Gamer’s sense of reality.
***
The following chronical of my life is written in hope that the future generations will be enlightened to Gandhi’s Reality, and thereby may succussfully manuever through the life that they are born into. 
Gandhi’s Reality states, “Acceptance of the truth behind our existence, unhampered by any assumptions, frees the mind to experience Reality, of the world and of oneself.” 
To accurately represent my living experience and those of the significant Players of my generation, I have included many original records. Some are in a type-written format and others are digital recordings and their transcripts. They include Student Archive Reports, Surveillance Recordings, and Scientific Reports. Please pay close attention to the beginning of each transcript, under the word “Source”. It will inform you to as the person who is the main character in the archival report, and the date and place that the report was made. All records may be retrieved from the Trinity BioDome’s Crystal Library: Student Archives.
My hope is that, armed with the unhampered and unassumeed Reality of our true existence, the following generations will possess the fortitude to untether from technology, enough, to accept and act upon their individual and combined force of influence and make the sagacious decisions that will be required of them, ensuring not only their survival, but the continuing survival of the human race.

Also I don't have anything here on Sustainable development but every time you hear President Trump say repeal two regulations for every new that is the beast he is fighting.

The regulations strangled the economy while overtime providing less and less benefit to the environment only being enacted to transfer wealth.

What I think is possible, is that there may have been some sort of agreement or understanding between one or more campaign officials and the Russian government. 

For example, in September of 2015, Donald Trump did a video conference with business leaders in Kiev, he basically called Obama a wimp, said we needed to have a stronger response to Russia's incursion in eastern Ukraine, and stated we needed to arm rebels.

By June or July of 2016, Donald Trump instructed members of his campaign to change RNC platform language to do the opposite of that. And by August of 2016, he was suggesting that we seek better relations with Russia, recognize the annexation of Crimea, and ease sanctions. 

Candidates change policy positions all the time, that certainly happens. But there are several other things that took place during that time - one, he took on Paul Manafort to run his campaign. Paul Manafort also brought in people like Carter Page and Michael Flynn. We know that Paul Manafort engaged in off-the books lobbying on behalf of Ukraines Pro-Russian puppet government, and that he has financial ties to Ukraine and Russia.

Let's assume Trump is completely and one hundred percent innocent. But what if Paul Manafort had a conversation with someone and said, ""you scratch our back and we'll scratch yours,"" or ""if you take action to help us, we will push for an easing of sanctions?"" Paul Manafort, an influential advisor says, ""you know what, Donald, I think you ought to reconsider your position on Ukraine,"" and Trump says, you know what, you are right! And as a result, Paul Manafort pushes changes to the RNC platform. Russia is so happy with these changes, they decide, you know what, we better help this guy win. And presto, the DNC leaks and Podesta emails start flowing, the propaganda aparatus turns on.

Even if Trump is entirely unaware and innocent, in the situation I described above, Paul Manafort had committed a variety of incredibly serious crimes.

And look, maybe it wasn't even someone as important as Paul Manafort, there are a handful of lower level employees we know were involved in the shift on Russian and Ukrainian policy, like Cohen, and Page. Perhaps one of them came to an understanding.

Alternatively, what if Russia blackmailed any one of those people? There are dozens of people who could have pushed for these pro-Russian changes. Forget the crazy sex tape claims about Trump. That's almost certainly fake. But plenty of people have sex tapes, plenty of people have drug addictions or gambling problems, or have done questionable or illegal things. What if Russia had blackmail on any single member of the Trump campaign and pressured them to seek those changes. What if that person is now a government employee? We need to know that.

"dea3w75","Well, that's as unfair as the blanket AWALT statement from TRP. I don't think incels or TRP only want hot 16 yo virgins. It's not that simple. TRP viewpoint is extreme but not without reason. It's too easy to look at TRP and say they're just a bunch of losers who can't get laid. That's too simplistic and dismissive. You have to understand why TRP was created and the catalysts. There are bad women in the world, just as there are bad men. There are very attractive women who gamed the guys and take advantage of their affections. The poor smucks finally wised up and challenged these women at their own game. The unfortunate thing is they will now loop in and fuck with the women who has done nothing to them and the cycle goes on. 

An average guy can really be easily strung along by a pretty face, while the pretty face act completely unaware and innocent. But she knows exactly what she is doing. There are consequences to this type of action, and TRP is really just a response to that. 

On the other hand of the spectrum, you have guys who think women owe them sex, which is equally absurd. 

Bottom line is, don't let the bad apples of both sexes ruin the good of the union. Men and women for centuries depended, loved and cared for each other.

"de9qc4n","My theory is that modernity and globalism have taketh away.

If you look back at nationalist countries, like nazi germany perhaps - you'll see that the people felt like they had ideas - something to live for. The collective citizenry believed their culture and economy were something to drive into greatness.

Even in America, we had all sorts of things. For example, the space race, among many other examples.

Ernst Juenger, for example, predicted the devolution of human intelligence in his late 1977 novel Eumeswil. Essentially all the proles in Eumeswil have what is called a ""Phonophore"" (aka iPhone) which, depending on your social status, decides what infomation you do and don't have. Grammar is taught to only elites. Language declines. Art, poetry, and real discussion no longer exist. Although individualism (what were seeing now) is what got everyone here, individualism no longer exists because the retardation of intelligence has created an enviroment when a question is asked - everyone answers in a ""swarm"". This is much of what you see today. CNN controlling narrative. What stories you do and don't see. Hell - the majority of people now get their news from Snapchat and Facebook. The more you read this book the more you realize that Juenger was a prophetic thinker.

Why haven't you heard of this book, perhaps? This author? 

Why were you so busy reading the same book (caged bird, mockingbird, huckleberry fin, etc) over and over in high school,  instead of something valuable with opposing view points? You know why.

Anyway, this book has given me a new perspective on life. The main character in the book considers himself an ""anarch"" (A unique term played off the obvious ""anarchist""). there are many quotes in the book that are very unique regarding the character and his self realizations as an ""anarch"". Some of my favorites is:

""A basic theme for the anarch is how man, left to his own devices, can defy superior force - whether state, society or the elements - by making use of their rules without submitting to them""

Why do people who leave nothing unchallenged still make demands of their own? They live off the fact that gods, father's, and poets used to exist. The essence of words has been diluted into empty titles. ""

""Motion seeks to transform facts into opinion, then into conviction; and anyone hewing to the facts themselves is shown at an adverse light. This is quite possible in a faculty where after every overthrow: world history is to be rewritten for the sake of the moment."" 

the sooner is realized this, the easier life has become for me. I've realized that we are controlled to the highest degree, and the elites are here to suppress us. You can tell by evidence such as 

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. 

The main point of this book is that resistance is futile. Regimes will come and go, Humans will naturally cycle thru various stages of civilization. Unfortunately, we're stuck in a particularly postmodern phase of the human condition. Many, if not most of us have nothing to reallly live for, because all emphesis has been placed on the individual, and any form of nationalism is triumphed by individualism and identity politics (tribalism). We're just one big global swarm. 

Absolute individualism is bad because more people today (and throughout history) are too fucking stupid to operate. I'm not trying to be pretentious, I'm simply looking at overall intelligence as a whole. That's why nationalism isn't half bad - because everyone can in some way help propel their country to the next stage.

I'm not particularly sad nor happy. I've simply accepted the current structure and, as an anarch, am now a neutral observer to it all.

"ddzr0rv","Ummm... I think that Trump was not supposed to win.  I think that Hillary was supposed to win, but the voters revolted.  I was shocked.  Happy, but shocked.  I don't even like Trump, but I despise Hillary.  

Americans do not like to be told what to do.  We do not like to be told who to vote for, or who not to vote for.  We have a rebellious nature.  I think Trump was voted in as a big ""Fuck you!"" to the establishment.  

If you are the establishment, what do you do?  You have all of these business dealings going on around the world, and you do not want someone like Trump to come in and ruin everything right?  Plus, you have to keep up the facade of ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" so the profane American voters do not realize what is happening.  We are supposed to be kept unaware and uninformed, so we don't revolt.  

What do you do in this situation?  Well, you send in the CIA to make sure that people loyal to The Cabal are surrounding Trump to keep him in line, and to make sure he implements the ""correct"" policy.  You also have the CIA manipulate the media so, if Trump says something to reveal the true nature of the system, then people will ignore it as being ""Trump crazy talk"" or ""fake news"".

""[Here is one of those supposed unimportant emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120) And it's not illegal to look at. [Despite what CNN says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A).

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

There is an active effort to contain news about the Podesta emails. It continues to be met w/ ridicule and mocking, and if that doesn't work more hostile measures. 

Maybe the public is just fully brainwashed, but the people I know in real life are not like this. The DNC establishment thinks they can wait out the storm and will not have to change away from failed policies and dirty trick politics.

Go into any current event relating to Trump and see how far you have to go to see the ""But her emails..."".

They've already sold the meme at this point, and part of the purpose is to confuse you over the fact there are actually **3 separate email stories at play**.

**Email story 2)** [DNC email leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) (blamed on Russia, most likely upset staffers from sabotaging Sanders)

**Email story 3)** John Podesta's personal emails [(Hillary's campaign chair who had his account accessed from a phishing scam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails) **These are the most damaging emails which include proof of media collusion, sabotaging Sanders, and more.** 

The Podesta emails are also the emails involved in the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which I suspect is meant to delegitimize the other scandals.

"ddsqa7a","Are you looking for advice on how to avoid being creepy? 

If this helps clear things up, most women consider ""creepy"" to mean ""boundary pushing"". For example, I'm creeped out by men that seem angry, resentful, or overly aggressive. I'm creeped out by men who ignore my refusal of their sexual advances. Even if it's only online, ignoring my personal boundaries like that indicates that they may ignore more important boundaries latter on (like consent). 

I'm also creeped out by men who bring up sex in inappropriate situations (work, on the street) since it suggests they are willing to disregard the social context to get what they want. The social context is a mutually agreed upon set of rules for how people should act. Ignoring it is pushing the boundaries of the group, which matters for the reason I mentioned above. 

Now this can be tricky for a socially awkward person to navigate. After all, they might ignore the social context because they are awkward and unaware and not because they have bad intentions. They might also miss a subtle refusal (like not responding to texts), and  continue to contact the person. The thing is, there is no way for me to tell if a person acting that way is harmless or dangerous, so I tend to think that everyone who acts that way is ""creepy"". 

I think the best way to avoid being creepy is to constantly look for feedback from the woman. For example, say a woman agrees to go on a date with you. While you guys are talking, check to see if she's smiling at you, playing with her hair/clothes, licking her lips, etc. 
That would mean she like's what you've done so far and you should try the next step, something like moving closer to her, touching her hand, putting your arm around her, touching her foot with your foot, etc. If she responds positively (leaning against you, smiling genuinely, etc) then it isn't creepy. If she responds negatively (moving away from you, frowning/looking uncomfortable), and you back off (as in stop touching her, physically back away from her), then it still isn't creepy. It would only be creepy if she responds negatively and you keep pushing. 

Same thing with online. Say you're messaging someone from OKC or Tinder or w/e. Is she messaging you back, hinting at making plans, complementing you, etc? Then you might want to ask for her phone # or try to schedule a date to meet in person. If she says yes then it isn't creepy. If she says no and you let it go then it isn't creepy. It would only be creepy if you get angry or demand an explanation or keep bothering her about it. 

Of course, just because you aren't creepy doesn't mean the woman will like you. You can be perfectly non-creepy and still have her be not physically attracted to you or dislike your personality. Can't please everyone after all.

They are afraid you'll read about Hillary Clinton promoting Trump's campaign to distract from the rise in Sander's popularity and her email investigation. (It's from April 2015 - two weeks after she announced running for president, not ""after she was mathematically the winner"")

""[Here is one of those supposed unimportant emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120) And it's not illegal to look at. [Despite what CNN says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A).

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

There is an active effort to contain news about the Podesta emails. It continues to be met w/ ridicule and mocking, and if that doesn't work more hostile measures. 

Maybe the public is just fully brainwashed, but the people I know in real life are not like this. The DNC establishment thinks they can wait out the storm and will not have to change away from failed policies and dirty trick politics.

Go into any current event relating to Trump and see how far you have to go to see the ""But her emails..."".

They've already sold the meme at this point, and part of the purpose is to confuse you over the fact there are actually **3 separate email stories at play**.

**Email story 2)** [DNC email leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) (blamed on Russia, most likely upset staffers from sabotaging Sanders)

The Washington Post reported
&gt; Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. 

**Email story 3)** John Podesta's personal emails [(Hillary's campaign chair who had his account accessed from a phishing scam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails) **These are the most damaging emails which include proof of media collusion, sabotaging Sanders, and more** 

The Podesta emails are also the emails involved in the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which I suspect is meant to delegitimize the other scandals.

He's not a high-level DNC guy, he's someone who's being asked for money and is promising only a small amount. [Snopes covered it here](http://www.snopes.com/clinton-compliant-citizenry/)

&gt; If these three sentences had appeared in a letter or essay, as opposed to a quick e-mail, they would read like this:

Dear John: Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, ****we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

They are afraid you'll read about Hillary Clinton promoting Trump's campaign to distract from the rise in Sander's popularity and her email investigation. (It's from April 2015 - two weeks after she announced running for president, not ""after she was mathematically the winner"")

&gt;“Many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to **move the more established candidates further to the right**,” the memo noted.

&gt; “In this scenario, **we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more ‘Pied Piper’ candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party,**” the Clinton campaign wrote.

&gt; As **examples of these “pied piper” candidates, the memo named Donald Trump** — as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson).

&gt; “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and **tell the press to *take*[sic] them seriously**,” the Clinton campaign concluded.

There is an active effort to contain news about the Podesta emails. It continues to be met w/ ridicule and mocking, and if that doesn't work more hostile measures. 

Maybe the public is just fully brainwashed, but the people I know in real life are not like this. The DNC establishment thinks they can wait out the storm and will not have to change away from failed policies and dirty trick politics.

Go into any current event relating to Trump and see how far you have to go to see the ""What about emails?"" They've already sold the meme at this point. 

Try correcting anyone who is making inaccurate statements about the primaries, or providing sources to ""The Pied Piper strategy"" where [Hillary Clinton's campaign strategy was to promote Donald Trump](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/) as a fringe candidate in order to keep the media from running stories on Bernie's rising popularity and her email investigation.

I guess it depends on how you define ""vulnerable"".

To me, a vulnerable person is anybody that doesn't have ambulance cover and isn't aware it is required.

That includes new arrivals who have moved to Victoria and therefore are not covered by foreign travel insurance (because travel insurance only covers you for complete return journeys, not a one-way move).

Or those who have moved from interstate and are completely unaware and unprepared for the large disparity in ambulance call-out fees.

What about the poor who are not on a form of social welfare and who aren't aware of the necessity to pay if they should ever need an ambulance?

My point is these people are all vulnerable - and the worst part is that the bill shock would be presented at a very low point in their life if they were also suffering a medical condition that necessitated an ambulance.

Let's face it - Victoria is full of nasties. You could be the healthiest person in the world but unlucky enough to be bitten by a snake.

"dcvcewp","This is something that is very hard for everyone to wrap their minds around, ideas like humans didn't come premade thousands of years ago with all the concepts we have today. That we make new concepts and new words all the time to grasp and describe all the varieties of phenomena we encounter, and as we progress in one field of study riding these concepts we make new discoveries and new concepts.

When new concepts initially arise they take a great deal of explication to describe and explain and interpret and defend. Then those concepts start to work their way through the culture as poets and writers and directors and priests and gamemakers learn them and apply them to their work to be digested by the general public. And everyone talks about it and argues about it and eventually these concepts become conventional wisdom common usage embedded in the culture. And then new individuals are born into this culture and find all these concepts ready-made as if they were eternal and had always existed and always will exist and were not the product of years of dialectic and propagation. 

Heidegger's writing is very difficult to understand because he was breaking new ground. He was dealing with questions that no one else (at least in Europe) had grappled with for centuries.

"dcljzw0","Try to talk about Obama with young liberals and they idolize the guy. Totally don't care about the drone strike programs, doubling the nation's debt, the extreme expansion of food service jobs falsifying an economic recovery that didn't happen, the extreme rise in cost of living, food stamps, government debt, money printing, healthcare costs, black income inequality; the extreme fall in home ownership and labor participation and median family income. 

As far as I can see it Obama had two significant legislative and policy moves in 8 fucking years (repealing don't ask don't tell and working the supreme court to legalize gay marriage).

Obama was an absolute disaster in every way shape and form. He had the highest favorability of any president in modern history and the legacy he leaves behind is Trump undoing his crown jewel of a failed healthcare plan, a destroyed middle east thanks to giving Clinton Sec. Of State job that she botched miserably, a DNC in total disarray, a [Democrat elite who are shunning Sanders and his supporters and real change](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/tom-perez-dnc/), and an entire government in republican control and what looks to end up a supermajority in 2018.

Anyone who calls themselves liberal or democrat and doesn't consider Obama an absolute failure is a liar or brainwashed. The DNC elite, especially Obama, are evil. 

The best part of all this, Obama's ruthless abuse of Executive Orders was truly despicable and stretched the power of what a president can do so far! And now people fear Trump will do exactly what Obama has set the precedent for. Hilarious.

Fred Sampson talks about the years that he was living in Louisville, Ky.  He was a nature lover and enjoyed looking at the trees and flowers along the road.  Just across the street from him a neighbor had a beautiful tree.  Its branches went spiraling upward to the sky and lifted its limbs to received the birds that were building their nests.  Some days he would just stand on the corner and look at that beautiful tree.  There was a fence around the neighbors yard and a locked iron gate in the front.  To further protect his house the neighbor had a barking dog in the yard.  Samson wrote, “Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.""
As he was coming home one day Sampson noticed that there was something wrong.  The gate to the neighbor’s yard was opened and the owner had chained the dog to a post.  There in the yard some men from the city were cutting down his beautiful tree.  Sampson was really concerned and walked over to the men.  He recognized  one of the workers and said to him, “Why are you cutting down that beautiful tree? Is something wrong?  If you had to cut one down why not that ugly one across the fence.”  Right on the other side of that fence was a scraggly tree with no real beauty to it.  It might have been doing a favor to cut that one down but not the beautiful one.  There must be something wrong!
The worker said to him, “Doc, come over here.”  So he went into the yard following the man.  Already parts of the lovely tree had been cut and now they were cutting through the heart of it.  As they got to the base of the tree the man told him to look inside.  There was something wrong. The whole heart of the tree was infested with termites.  The outside still looked fine; the bark was intact; the limbs were majestic; the leaves were green.  But the core was providing food and shelter for an infestation of termites.  The termites had gone right through the fence; the gate had been no obstacle, and the dog was unnoticed.  Now because the core of the tree was missing, the tree endangered  those living in the house and anyone walking on the sidewalk.  Yes, there was something wrong. So the workers were called in to cut it down.
There is a lesson here for us as Christians.  Despite the protections built around us the enemy can enter and destroy us.  When we are unaware and complacent the enemy can cause something to be desperately wrong. Today I am going to ask every one of us to look inside and see if there is something desperately wrong inside. 
I would suggest that there is something wrong:
 
I. When you fail to remember the blessings of God.
I love the 103rd Psalm.  David says: Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 2  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
He starts out praising God and then he names them one after another.  The other day I was talking with a friend and he was saying that we should be praising God continually because of all he has given.  And I agree.  We should praise God for life – and every one of us here today has that.  And even if you don’t have life – praise God that you are on your way to heaven.  Thank God for your family, for your church, for your salvation – in everything give thanks to the Lord.  Have you been taking God’s blessings for granted?  Cultivate an attitude of praise for every good thing that God gives to you.
And I think it right . . . to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.2 Pet. 1:13
“As I came from the schoolhouse with my sugar-rationing book, my mind traveled back over the years to scenes of childhood. As a small girl it was my task to help Mother wash the dishes. Standing on a stool, I did my best, but there was one cup that I pushed back and washed last because there was always sugar in the bottom which I must rinse out.  Mother was concerned because of the waste. I can still hear her say, very tactfully, to an aged uncle who lived with us, as he reached for the third spoonful of sugar, “Perhaps, Uncle John, if you would stir up the first spoonful, you would not need the other two.” Her suggestion was heeded—until the next meal.
I have found that the same is true about many things in life. We do not need more blessings so much as we need to appreciate the sweetness of the blessings which we now have. By stirring up our memories, we get new sweetness from lovely music we have heard, good poetry, helpful sermons, expressions of kindness, beautiful scenery, and, of course, best of all—God’s precious Word, which is “sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.” Ada Marie HILLIS.
I would suggest that there is something wrong:
 
II.  When you are serving God because of duty and not love.
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. Col. 1:10  When you are doing something for duty you do the bare minimum – just enough to get by.  But to act from love you ask, “How much can I do, and how much can I give? 
One sign that there is something wrong is in our lack of attendance.  I believe that we have experienced some spiritual slippage in our attendance.  I can remember years ago as pastor, that most people came to both services on Sunday.  I was surprised when I came back that that was not the case anymore.  Perhaps at that time the church was still new and there was a sense of joy and commitment about making sure our church prospered.  Everyone knows that when several people miss a service of church that the spirit goes down for everyone and there is something wrong.  Right now it’s a good thing we don’t vote often because we would not have a quorum.  I can also remember when church folks tried not to be away for more than one or two weeks in a row, because they wanted to support the church and knew they would be missed.

"dc5zpau","One thing I don't like about the elder dragons is that they speak and are intentionally malevolent.  When GW2 first came out the elder dragons were described more as forces of nature just doing what they do, like a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake, and without any reference to or notice of the puny mortal races that are just collateral damage.  They consume the accumulated magic in the world, then go into hibernation for thousands of years and the magic seeps back out of them, then they wake up and consume it all again.  That's the cycle of the world.

I like that.  A deadly, omnipotent, but ultimately unaware and indifferent force of nature is something different than the standard MMO fair of the old cliche of some calculating malevolent entity seeking more power and killing everything in its path to get it.  

Zhaitan walked a line between pure force of nature and self-aware entity.  Zhaitan never spoke to the player, though one of his two primary lieutenants could, the [Mouth of Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mouth_of_Zhaitan).  His other lieutenant, the [Eye of Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eye_of_Zhaitan) could not.  It was also said that Zhaitan absorbed the knowledge and experiences of every living being he consumed, so there was some subsumed understanding of the plight of the mortal races he decimated, but it still felt like an indifferent force of nature overall.

Mordremoth of course was conscious, self-aware, scheming, and talked directly to us (especially if you're a Sylvari) and even taunted us.  That's where this got annoying.  There was no way you could mistake Mordremoth for being an indifferent force of nature, he was intentionally battling and trying to destroy all mortal races.

2Ti 3:1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
2Ti 3:2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
2Ti 3:3  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
2Ti 3:4  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
2Ti 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.


&gt;Fred Sampson talks about the years that he was living in Louisville, Ky.  He was a nature lover and enjoyed looking at the trees and flowers along the road.  Just across the street from him a neighbor had a beautiful tree.  Its branches went spiraling upward to the sky and lifted its limbs to received the birds that were building their nests.  Some days he would just stand on the corner and look at that beautiful tree.  There was a fence around the neighbors yard and a locked iron gate in the front.  To further protect his house the neighbor had a barking dog in the yard.  Samson wrote, “Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.""

&gt;As he was coming home one day Sampson noticed that there was something wrong.  The gate to the neighbor’s yard was opened and the owner had chained the dog to a post.  There in the yard some men from the city were cutting down his beautiful tree.  Sampson was really concerned and walked over to the men.  He recognized  one of the workers and said to him, “Why are you cutting down that beautiful tree? Is something wrong?  If you had to cut one down why not that ugly one across the fence.”  Right on the other side of that fence was a scraggly tree with no real beauty to it.  It might have been doing a favor to cut that one down but not the beautiful one.  There must be something wrong!

&gt;The worker said to him, “Doc, come over here.”  So he went into the yard following the man.  Already parts of the lovely tree had been cut and now they were cutting through the heart of it.  As they got to the base of the tree the man told him to look inside.  There was something wrong. The whole heart of the tree was infested with termites.  The outside still looked fine; the bark was intact; the limbs were majestic; the leaves were green.  But the core was providing food and shelter for an infestation of termites.  The termites had gone right through the fence; the gate had been no obstacle, and the dog was unnoticed.  Now because the core of the tree was missing, the tree endangered  those living in the house and anyone walking on the sidewalk.  Yes, there was something wrong. So the workers were called in to cut it down.

&gt;There is a lesson here for us as Christians.  Despite the protections built around us the enemy can enter and destroy us.  When we are unaware and complacent the enemy can cause something to be desperately wrong.
Today I am going to ask every one of us to look inside and see if there is something desperately wrong inside. 

&gt;I would suggest that there is something wrong:

 

&gt;I. When you fail to remember the blessings of God.

&gt;I love the 103rd Psalm.  David says:
Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 2  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

&gt;He starts out praising God and then he names them one after another.  The other day I was talking with a friend and he was saying that we should be praising God continually because of all he has given.  And I agree.  We should praise God for life – and every one of us here today has that.  And even if you don’t have life – praise God that you are on your way to heaven.  Thank God for your family, for your church, for your salvation – in everything give thanks to the Lord.  Have you been taking God’s blessings for granted?  Cultivate an attitude of praise for every good thing that God gives to you.

&gt;And I think it right . . . to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.2 Pet. 1:13

&gt;“As I came from the schoolhouse with my sugar-rationing book, my mind traveled back over the years to scenes of childhood. As a small girl it was my task to help Mother wash the dishes.

&amp;gt;Fred Sampson talks about the years that he was living in Louisville, Ky.  He was a nature lover and enjoyed looking at the trees and flowers along the road.  Just across the street from him a neighbor had a beautiful tree.  Its branches went spiraling upward to the sky and lifted its limbs to received the birds that were building their nests.  Some days he would just stand on the corner and look at that beautiful tree.  There was a fence around the neighbors yard and a locked iron gate in the front.  To further protect his house the neighbor had a barking dog in the yard.  Samson wrote, “Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.""

&amp;gt;As he was coming home one day Sampson noticed that there was something wrong.  The gate to the neighbor’s yard was opened and the owner had chained the dog to a post.  There in the yard some men from the city were cutting down his beautiful tree.  Sampson was really concerned and walked over to the men.  He recognized  one of the workers and said to him, “Why are you cutting down that beautiful tree? Is something wrong?  If you had to cut one down why not that ugly one across the fence.”  Right on the other side of that fence was a scraggly tree with no real beauty to it.  It might have been doing a favor to cut that one down but not the beautiful one.  There must be something wrong!

&amp;gt;The worker said to him, “Doc, come over here.”  So he went into the yard following the man.  Already parts of the lovely tree had been cut and now they were cutting through the heart of it.  As they got to the base of the tree the man told him to look inside.  There was something wrong. The whole heart of the tree was infested with termites.  The outside still looked fine; the bark was intact; the limbs were majestic; the leaves were green.  But the core was providing food and shelter for an infestation of termites.  The termites had gone right through the fence; the gate had been no obstacle, and the dog was unnoticed.  Now because the core of the tree was missing, the tree endangered  those living in the house and anyone walking on the sidewalk.  Yes, there was something wrong. So the workers were called in to cut it down.

&amp;gt;There is a lesson here for us as Christians.  Despite the protections built around us the enemy can enter and destroy us.  When we are unaware and complacent the enemy can cause something to be desperately wrong.
Today I am going to ask every one of us to look inside and see if there is something desperately wrong inside.

&amp;gt;I. When you fail to remember the blessings of God.

&amp;gt;I love the 103rd Psalm.  David says:
Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 2  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

&amp;gt;He starts out praising God and then he names them one after another.  The other day I was talking with a friend and he was saying that we should be praising God continually because of all he has given.  And I agree.  We should praise God for life – and every one of us here today has that.  And even if you don’t have life – praise God that you are on your way to heaven.  Thank God for your family, for your church, for your salvation – in everything give thanks to the Lord.  Have you been taking God’s blessings for granted?  Cultivate an attitude of praise for every good thing that God gives to you.

&amp;gt;And I think it right . . . to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.2 Pet. 1:13

&amp;gt;“As I came from the schoolhouse with my sugar-rationing book, my mind traveled back over the years to scenes of childhood. As a small girl it was my task to help Mother wash the dishes.

"dbjbx2x","Nice post, I agree there are many similarities between Flagg and Gaunt.  I think there is a possibility they are the same sort of being, but in my opinion they aren't the same ""person"".  We know Flagg started off as a mortal man, became a sorcerer, and eventually transcended his humanity to become something more ""demonic"".  Gaunt, in comparison, seems to be implied to have been ""born"" a demon, although his function is fairly similar to Flagg's (and Linoge's), and we don't know if Gaunt had been a human at some point in the past (possible but seems unlikely).  We do get a few flashbacks from Gaunt's perspective of him as a evil peddler in ancient times, but I don't remember any suggestion that he was a human originally like Walter Padick, although I cant specifically rule it out.  He does sort of posture and act like he is the Devil himself, but that is probably just typical demonic deceitful smugness. 

It's extremely probable that Gaunt is also in the service of the ""Outer Dark"" like Flagg, although it's hard to say whether he is officially in the ""employ"" of the Red, it's possible he is a leftover being of Todash or Prim, a demon along the lines of IT or Tak or Munshun etc.  I tend to believe he is in the same ""line of work"" as Flagg, though, with so many levels of the Tower, it takes more than one agent to sow discord and break reality. Andre Linoge is probably another ""coworker"". Linoge has the whole ""legion"" thing going on too, which has been attributed to Flagg and Maerlyn as well. We know linoge takes ""apprentices"" so perhaps he trains humans to become beings like himself to work for the King, maybe he even taught Flagg some tricks sometime over the thousands of years of his career.

 Pennywise also did the ""I am legion"" routine in the drain, with the dead kid's voices.  Pennywise doesn't work for and isn't even aware of the Crimson King, though, and seems a lot more powerful (but lazier) than demons that do, such as Mr Munshun.  It may even be inadvertently harming the cause of the Crimson King, by occasionally eating psychic kids that could otherwise be breaking beams. Derry is a special case in the macroverse though, the whole town seems to be a thinny or otherwise especially cursed by IT's impact, and the King is known to be aware of Pennywise even if the reverse isn't true.  Tak is another unaffiliated loose cannon in my opinion, though less powerful. With his need for a host body he seems to be more similar to Munshun than anything else, though a lot less stable in its ability to manifest, though I'm not sure if this indicates more power or less. 

So I'd say, out of the major demonic antagonists in the macroverse, Flagg, Linoge, Gaunt, and Munshun are on the same side, with Flagg as the King's highest ranking servant, who has his own agenda of betrayal. Pennywise is unaffiliated and generally unaware and uninterested in anything but feeding and dreaming (Pennywise in IT's own thoughts honestly believed ITself to be the only god in the universe besides the Turtle).  Demons like Tak are probably just ""wild demons"" of Todash who wreak havoc if they get the chance, but aren't actually working for or controlled by the Red formally. He and the other random monsters that show up in King stories mostly serve the cause of the Red anyway, inadvertently, just by causing harm to the White and sowing Discord, but most are not actually part of the faction in my opinion.

It is **so** true! ROFL

&gt;A tyrant has been elected president. 

Wrong again, Clinton was the tyrant wannabe, (you know, keeping the citizenry “unaware and compliant” with the “public policy” meanwhile implementing the “private policy” on behalf of billionaire bankers), but fortunately the country as a whole saw right through her.  Thank God for that!

&gt;In a democratic process everyone's vote should equal exactly 1 vote, not more or less depending on geographical location. Otherwise you are saying that the 500k people in Wyoming deserve more of a say in our election than someone from California or Texas or New York.

Hold on a second!  Wyomingites each have a 1/500,000 say in who their governor will be but Californians each have only a 1/38,000,000 say in who their governor will be… ***How is THAT fair?!?!***  If everyone’s vote should equal exactly 1 vote how do *you* explain this discrepancy!?!?  Why do the folks in Wyoming each have 76 times more influence over who their governor will be than Californians do in California?  ***WHYYYYYYyyyyyy?***   LOL  

Sorry, but your argument is too simpleminded.  You see, if every single Californian moved to Wyoming and every single Wyomingite moved to California then the positions would simply be reversed since the electoral votes for each state are based on *population*.  It has NOTHING to do with the specific geographic location of the voter.  To win the Presidency a candidate needs to win elections in several locations throughout the country and can’t simply get all their votes in just one or two places.

I have no reason to distrust Assange at this point, and even if I did, it's a more plausible story than Russia hacking the DNC and leaking the info to Wikileaks. 

If Russia does have info on the inner workings of the American Government (supposedly getting it from a phishing scam, because Podesta and others are technologically retarded ((seriously, who uses p@ssw0rd as a password?)) ), then its more than likely that China, Iran, name an enemy, they probably have that info too. And finally, if I worked in the DNC, saw what was happening behind the scenes, and had any integrity left, I'd have exposed the corruption as well.

&gt; What you're ignoring is that a foreign state intervened, for a purpose.

If they did, it was probably to avoid a War. Let them have Syria, let Assad and Russia kick ISIS in the teeth, end the fucking proxy war and let the Syrian people have some peace so they can start rebuilding their Country. It's the only humane way to move forward.

Claim: Hillary's campaign wants ""unaware"" and ""compliant"" citizens

Evidence: An email to John from Bill 

&gt; And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.
​

Sounds awful doesn't it?  Well of course it does because its been intentionally removed from its context to deceive you.

Here is the full quote: 

&gt; Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

Now if you are going to read that and conclude that Hillary's campaign wants unaware citizens, you are failing at reading comprehension.  In fact the opposite is true.  The author of this email is lamenting the loss of civics classes, the demeaning of government, and the unawareness of the modern American electorate because he thinks it will hurt Clinton's chances in the general election, which it did. 

Likewise the talk about a ""compliant"" citizenry is nothing more than our captain obvious noticing that this has been a very heated campaign, and many people have become politically energized, and radicalized.  It is only sane to worry about how this energy is being expressed on the right with the resurgence of white nationalism and white supremacy.  

This email is not talking about the relatively short history of the Clinton Campaign, but instead worries about broad political trends that have been decades in the making, and how these are working against Hillary.  They apparently understand that Hillary's policy wonkishness is not going to resonate when compared to Trump's entertainment politics.  They know exactly the game Trump is playing.

"dazzqj6","First of all I want to thank you for the kind of reply you wrote and your genuine interest in understanding.

Also I want to say that I didn't thought your intention was at all discriminatory, quite the opposite actually.

You see, the point is related to how we express ourselves (even how we think, as that is language based). Most languages tend to be sexist and discriminatory by themselves. Same happens to many of the expressions (and behaviours) we use in a daily basis. The real problem that most people don't realize or see as something important to take into account happens and works at the psychological and subconcious level. It is not really related to the intention put in the words (or actions) but on the words/expressions themselves and both the implications they have and where and how those expressions originated. And we use this way of thinking, words, expressions, actions,etc in our daily basis without realize they actually have origins, implications or both that actually are discriminatory and subconciously keep maintaining that discrimination. But as it is not our intention we don't identify or see them as such, we just assume they are just something normal, to the point of even thinking it is stupid or a nonsense to believe they would have those implications.

About what you said specifically is pretty much what /u/Hittheginger comment say. Not intentionally of course, but it actually has those unintentional implications, and show the subconscious psychological thing I was talking about. Using the examples you said, there is no need or reason to state ""the grass is green"" or ""the sky is blue"". No matter the context, that is something that simply is not needed to be said or explained, it just is. So why then we still think that kind of thing is something needed to be said or explained regarding certain topics ? Well, that's because a discrimination regarding that subject certainly exist that makes us feel it must be said, and even while our intention is to use it to defend the subject of that discrimination, we are actually in an unaware and unconcscious way also contributing to keep it. After all, you just don't have to defend the sky is blue or the grass is green, right ? In a sense it can be very related to what is called ""positive discrimination"".

And well, if you want a more or less related example, you can use how the main male character of the anime Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works treats and thinks he must be the one defending female characters (when clearly they are way stronger and more capable to defend themselves and him than he is). He has all the good intentions but still what he is doing actually (in an unaware unconscious way) is totally discriminating women and keeping a discriminating sexist role and behaviour. (If you haven't seen this specific anime I am sure you can get the picture from any other anime, tv show, book, movie, whatever you have seen).

This is more or less the same, but more related to language expression than physical behaviour and more..... let's say..... I don't know, subtle I guess.",1481318848,"well, that's because a discrimination regarding that subject certainly exist that makes us feel it must be said, and even while our intention is to use it to defend the subject of that discrimination, we are actually in an unaware and unconcscious way also contributing to keep it.","unaware and unconcscious","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unconcscious","unconcscious",NA,NA,1

Plus there have been plenty of racist incidents reported in my region of the country, and I personally have had white people tell me shit at costco, looking at me saying ""this is why we need a wall"" so no their fear is not unwarranted. Try looking at it from a perspective besides your own.


Also this country has deported citizens of latino heritage before its not that crazy to think they would do it again.



Edit: thank you for some sanity, tbh from reddit these past couple months I got the feeling white people hate me. I really dont understand where all this anti illegal talk (which we all fucking know is a dogwhistle for anti latino and YES it is, dont look like an idiot trying to deny it, it just embarrasses you) comes from. I live in one of the most latino heavy areas of the US and we can even tell theres less illegal immigrants coming in. Mexico's economy is on the upswing. My dad came here illegally yes, hes been a citizen since the 70s and makes more than a dr even now. I am pretty sure he has contributed more to society and the US than many of the racist shit stains out there.

No I dont think all trump supporters are racist though they either are ok with racism or are unaware and ignorant of the many many forms racism can take.  I guess they simply dont care about my civil rights or the civil rights of people who look like me.

Yes I do think we need to do something about illegal immigration, at least securing the vulnerable parts of the border from smugglers etc. No deportation for 11 million is not feasible and you are a idiot if you support that. Everyday you smoke weed, speed, steal music and movies from the internet but you have the fucking gall to call people ""illegals"" for coming in to a country that pretty much has a big ass fucking sign over it saying ""come here!"" because of business. Everyone in the United States has broken the law at one time or another, no that doesnt mean we shouldnt have laws or border security but that doesnt mean you get to dehumanize people. Giving them a path to legalization is the only sane and pragmatic action that exists but that doesnt make you satisfy your overly emotional stance towards it. There are bigger fucking thieves in this country and they are at the top. You guys are focusing on the small fry.



Watch in 30-40 years theres going to be a Latino or Black Trump and white people will be shitting their pants when hes saying the same dogwhistle bullshit about white people. Yes I will vote against him, like I voted against Trump. Sorry for my rant, im high.


lol looks like i TRIGGERED a bunch of trumpers. I got tired of responding to each of your inane comments. Real examples of the failed education system in this country (that the republicans fucked over mind you)  so please spare me of your banality





Also I find it so hilarious that white people are so scared of mexicans....you know they are pretty much brown rednecks right? They love church, dont like to come into contact with institutions of power unless absolutely needed, love cops, are mostly law abiding, love buying big ass trucks for no reason, are EXTREMELY family centered, they kinda almost love white people sorta, believe in hard work (I mean you have to to immigrate) all this bullshit is just ensuring a brownlash will happen when they become the majority.

Some of the revelations the emails brought are below.

**Hillary has public positions on policy and private ones**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927

“*But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position*.”


This leak is a big one because anything she tells us that she will do can and should be considered questionable. Whenever Hillary tells the public a position, a goal, or what she will do for America, there is no way we can be sure if she has an opposite, private position.

This was one of her private paid $225,000 speeches to Wall Street. Behind closed doors she is telling her Wall Street donors one thing, and the American people another thing.

**Paying people to incite violence and unrest at Trump rallies**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3833

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31335

“*Engage immigrant rights organizations. DREAMers have been bird dogging Republican presidential candidates on DACA/DAPA, but they’ve learned to respond. There’s an opportunity to bird dog and record questions about Trump’s comments and connect it to the policy*.”

“*It doesn’t matter what the friggin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker*” (from https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY video of Clinton paid staff)

""*I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these ass holes to pop off, it’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know? You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you*.""

Bird-dogging"" is a term coined by high level Clinton staffers who openly talk about it in the video.  They boast about inciting violence at Trump rallies, paying for every “protest”, manipulating Americans through the media to think that Trump is dangerous, and tricking people into thinking Trump supporters are violent and bad.

They laugh about paying off mentally ill and homeless people for years to incite violence against conservatives.  Truly despicable.  And they pretended to be Bernie supporters while they were ""protesting"".

They admit to starting the Chicago riot where police were seriously hurt, and admit to shutting down the freeway in Arizona, partnering with Black Lives Matter. We even haveproof that Hillary paid people to shut down the Chicago rally.

Inciting a riot is illegal under 18 US Code § 2102.

They also think 50% of people in Iowa and Wisconsin are racists, as they state in the video.

Robby Mook, Clinton Campaign Manager, mentions the Priorities SuperPAC in a leak, which is implicated in the video.

Bob Creamer (who was fired) claims in the video that the campaign knew about everything.  Bob Creamer visited the White House 340 times and personally met with Obama 45 times.

**Hillary's campaign discusses their serious need to regain favor over their ""unaware"" and ""compliant"" citizens they've worked to produce.**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599

“*And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

""*They do not plan to release anything publicly, so no posting online or anything public-facing, just to the committee*.""

""*That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over. It also includes emails that HRC had that Sid didn't*.”

“*Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will*.”

""*We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of*.""

""*That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over*.""

The State Department was:

(1) Coordinating with the Clinton political campaign.

(2) Colluding with the press to spin it positively.

(3) Doing so BEFORE they released it to AN EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Clinton campaign was always a step ahead of the committee investigating them. Shameful.

Nick states ""Just spoke to State"" He goes on to reveal that State colluded with him about which emails are being revealed to committee and that the State plans to plant a story with AP.

Shows intent to withhold emails from the subpoena.

“[REDACTED] believes STATE has an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the CLINTON e-mails in order to protect STATE interests and those of CLINTON,”

""[Redacted] advised that, in exchange for marking the email unclassified, STATE would reciprocate by allowing the FBI AGENTS to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.""

Hillary Clinton dreams of completely “open trade and open borders”

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmFhxFke

“*My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders*”


This was stated at one of her $225,000 paid secret speeches to Wall Street that she has tried desperately to hide… This email contains those speeches in those attachments.


During the 3rd debate, Hillary tried to pivot away from this damning topic by stating she only meant energy. Read the quote for yourself, energy is just one aspect of her open borders policy.

“…*the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region*.”

“*Clintons should know better than to raise money from folks whose primary concern has been supporting the NIAC, a notorious supporter of the Radical Islamic Mullahs. ""The Clinton’s have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cash…putting money ahead of principle*.”

Hillary's Chief of Staff admits in the 2nd link that foreign interests sway Hillary to do what they want her to do (money for mandatory appearances).  She also admits that the ""Friend of Hillary"" list is available and rentable to people who want to influence, but that it’s too sensitive to talk in email.

This leak shows Hillary knows Saudis and Qatar are funding ISIS, which is an enemy of the state.  After knowing this, Hillary accepted tens of millions in donations from these terrorist-funding governments (of course they are getting something back in return). She also supported arms deals to them.


These are just a FEW things the emails revealed. There are many more. Not even all of them are public yet.

**Hillary has public positions on policy and private ones**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927

“But If Everybody's Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position.”


This leak is a big one because anything she tells us that she will do can and should be considered questionable. Whenever Hillary tells the public a position, a goal, or what she will do for America, there is no way we can be sure if she has an opposite, private position.

This was one of her private paid $225,000 speeches to Wall Street. Behind closed doors she is telling her Wall Street donors one thing, and the American people another thing.

**Paying people to incite violence and unrest at Trump rallies**

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3833

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31335

“Engage immigrant rights organizations. DREAMers have been bird dogging Republican presidential candidates on DACA/DAPA, but they’ve learned to respond. There’s an opportunity to bird dog and record questions about Trump’s comments and connect it to the policy.”

“It doesn’t matter what the friggin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker” (from https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY video of Clinton paid staff)

""I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these ass holes to pop off, it’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know? You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you.""

""Bird-dogging"" is a term coined by high level Clinton staffers who openly talk about it in the video.  They boast about inciting violence at Trump rallies, paying for every “protest”, manipulating Americans through the media to think that Trump is dangerous, and tricking people into thinking Trump supporters are violent and bad.

They laugh about paying off mentally ill and homeless people for years to incite violence against conservatives.  Truly despicable.  And they pretended to be Bernie supporters while they were ""protesting"".

They admit to starting the Chicago riot where police were seriously hurt, and admit to shutting down the freeway in Arizona, partnering with Black Lives Matter. We even haveproof that Hillary paid people to shut down the Chicago rally.

Inciting a riot is illegal under 18 US Code § 2102.

They also think 50% of people in Iowa and Wisconsin are racists, as they state in the video.

Robby Mook, Clinton Campaign Manager, mentions the Priorities SuperPAC in a leak, which is implicated in the video.

Bob Creamer (who was fired) claims in the video that the campaign knew about everything.  Bob Creamer visited the White House 340 times and personally met with Obama 45 times.

**Hillary's campaign talks of need to re-evaluate how they approach their previous ""unaware"" and ""compliant"" base**

(2) Colluding with the press to spin it positively.

(3) Doing so BEFORE they released it to AN EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Clinton campaign was always a step ahead of the committee investigating them. Shameful.

This was stated at one of her $225,000 paid secret speeches to Wall Street that she has tried desperately to hide… This email contains those speeches in those attachments.

3 missed calls. Who was she with? 



Of course i'd fucked up. Caving into my desires was an impossible thing to avoid with a power like this! It really doesn't matter what i use it for, the only time i did was when it was beneficial for us. Maybe i used it once for another thing... But that's not the point. There's no mistake in this reasoning, there was only mistakes in a few choices i'd made; And i *get* that now. I couldn't help myself really, It's always an *exhilarating* experience. There's something about *shoving* somebodies consciousness aside and mentally *dominating* them.



But she never liked it.



She never understood.



She never had any pride, that *her* man was extraordinary.





Even when i would, *save* her with it. 



No policeman could write her a speeding ticket. Nobody could keep her from doing what she wanted, as long as she was with me! How could she give all of that up? Everthing i've *done* for her, which there are plenty of things she doesn't even know about.



Oh, i've let her know. She has a few voicemails waiting for her... She will hear my story in the morning...




Out of respect.... i'd kept quiet. But i can't go on without her knowing. 



*She... should know how i feel*



I begin to tear up, staring at my blindingly bright phone screen. There wouldn't ever be a reply. I was fooling myself.



But i'll be damned if she doesn't at least *think* of taking me back. The voicemails and texts had already made their way to her phone, i'm sure. Why should i respect her by leaving her alone if she doesn't respect my apologies? That bitch!



*She... should know.*




I'll close my eyes while i wait for her response, just for a moment..


-----


There it was, the ocean. A sapphire in a world made of quartz and fool's gold. This was where me and Bianca spent many weekends, against a palm tree, facing the unconquerable depths.



This had been a recurring dream of mine. With the mental fortitude i posses, it's fairly easy to access a memory if i want to. This was my comfortable setting, my place of meditation for the past few weeks. But right now, there was no Bianca beside me. It was... something that my mind couldn't recreate for some apparent reason. It could never be as great as the real thing.



But this dream, was *different*.



I could feel her presence, *somewhere*.



This time, i couldn't just sit here by myself. My mind had to focus on the true objective, the one that i wanted the most.



*Bianca*



I darted my way through the sand, unable to hold back the flash flood coming from my eyes. Maybe if i traveled far enough, she would be here. Maybe if i could change, she wouldn't hide.



*""Charley..""*



Where was it coming from? 



""Bianca?""



A soft and fragile hand grasps my shoulder from behind.



""Charley... I thought you'd at least respect me...""



Before i could turn around-



-----



I'm awake, and sweating *profusely*.




**The voicemails, the texts.** I had to do something about these things. 




She was right, i had promised to respect her decision.




*You're such an asshole, Charles*



The clock reads 3:52 AM, which means i'm basically sober at this point. My body has easily taken care of my night of drinking.



*How could i have been so careless?*



""Stupid.""



There's no way she could be awake right now. 



I-I would have to make the jump, yes, to erase this drunken judgement of mine. I couldn't allow myself to interfere with her healing process, i.. just want her to be happy.



*But i also promised her, that i'd never use this ability.. on her*




I paused for a moment. Could i really do this? The moral pro's and con's in my head began to spin. A sigh broke loose from deep within me, it was lose-lose as far as keeping my word to her.



*That would explain the absence of an angel on my shoulder*



No, I could at least delete these things i'd said, and slip out of her body before her consciousness could notice. This was my decision.



*The process begins now*




""Tempero.""



My mind's eye opens. A sea of silhouettes appear before me. 



Every human in existence is right here, now i must find her. I concentrate on her face in my mind. Her beautiful, raven colored hair. Her eyes, the purest hazel you could ever find, with a darker tinted brown hue. Her sultry, playful expressions. Her voice.



And i see her. The silhouettes dissappear, and it's just her. She's fast asleep in bed, holding onto her pillow tight, cuddling it. 



It seemed as if she was in a bad dream. Her face was calm, but her body seemed restless. It was as her body was frightened, yet her mind was unaware and ignorant of danger. This was it, i must go now. 



With my eyes still closed, i dive into her. Once again, i feel a powerful connection with her mind and body. My consciousness becomes distressed, because i truly missed this feeling. 



----



*This smell*



It was the smell of Bianca. The indescribable smell that individuals have cemented on them, Bianca's had always been the best. Somewhere in between the sweetness of cotton candy, and the tartness of apple pie. It was the only way i can begin to describe it, even though it smells nothing like these things. From this smell i know i'm truly at home.



*And to be honest, i'm relieved there's not another man here right now*



But, something felt odd.



I sat up in Bianca's bed, and fumbled for her phone, which was most likely resting on her nightstand charging. It was there, underneath a hand mirror.
I couldn't bring myself to look in that mirror, no matter how much i wanted to.


I click the home button, and sure enough, i see the notifications from me. 3 voicemails, 2 Texts.



I slide to unlock the phone, yet, i'm prompted for a passcode.



*Fuck*



""Let me think.""



I try to put in her birthday. 3-17-94. Too many characters. It was a 4 digit code.



*If i were Bianca, what code would i use?*



1-6-94, It was just a wishful guess.




The phone unlocks, to my surprise, and torture. She was using the date of my birthday for her phone lock? 



I wanted to cry, but i held myself together. I had to complete this task, before Bianca's consciousness was alarmed. It was easy to do this to unsuspecting people, because they would never know who the second person in their head was; For Bianca, it would be a no-brainer, and she could never forgive me.



I froze.



I couldn't sense a second consciousness in this body. I could no longer feel a connection with Bianca.



*What the fuck?*



I begin to panic. What have i done? Did i erase her conscious? I have completely forgotten what i even came here to accomplish. At this moment, i could only think about the unknown. Bianca must be so terrified. 



The tears come streaming down my face. I bury my head in the pillow and begin to scream out of angst and frustration.



*Why am i such a fucking idi-*




My sorrow is interrupted by the familiar sound of Bianca's lame ass generic ringtone, suggesting she was getting a call.



*What now?!*



The caller ID said, ""Charley""

The people there occasionally talk like Goebbels might have done. It's typically not that bad, but when I read and read and read those emails, the bad feelings started adding up. I got the impression they basically gave up on democracy. I mean quotes like this here (I googled ""podesta emails electorate"" to find this particular mail):

&gt; [...] And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking [...]

Shouldn't you want to work towards having everyone well informed? Doesn't democracy break down otherwise?

I got the impression they think about people as tools. There were things that made me think they'd like a lot of people being kept perpetually reliant on welfare, just to have a good amount of guaranteed votes. There were opinions where African-Americans were seen as hopeless in contrast to Indian-Americans or Jews, basically a genuinely racist view for how the world looks like instead of a socioeconomic reason (I didn't manage to find the email where I saw this).

&gt; Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats
and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its
time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump,
Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

"d9rpynh","it goes beyond that. TPP / TTIP will be more horrible than the EU. 

It has been revealed that Hillary wants an unaware and compliant citizenry. There are plenty of indicators that if Hillary becomes elected we are heading towards a NWO with the Oligarchy creating an unaware and compliant citizenry by social engineering.
I'm not gonna go into detail but it basically works this way:

Keep middle class from growing, reduce quality of education and thus critical thinking, flood nation with migrants to keep wages low and establish the one party state (low income migrants from the middle east arent gonna vote for republicans).

Reduce freedom of speech (criticism is dismissed as racist and bigoted), by using academia to influence people and push a narrative (today's college neoliberals with their safe spaces and PC bullshit came from somewhere after all). 


Discourage people from accumulating wealth by raising taxes the more you earn and outsourcing manufactoring jobs.

Lower class keeps growing and growing. Feeding propaganda to lower class becomes easy since quality of education is reduced and unemployed / low income people are suckers when it comes to gov. benefits and ""the rich have to pay their fair share"" (higher taxes for rich and middle class to finance wellfare state).

The Clintons have been in power for three decades now. Bill's policies contributed greatly to 2008. Hillarycare is a failure. She destabilized the middle east and wants to increase immigration by 550%.

Because it was publicly embarrassing. Her leaving is not evidence.

Because elected officials endorse people.

&gt;‘But Hillary is better than Trump!’ says Michael Moore, who plans to vote for Hillary. This is like saying the Democrats, who undermined and rigged the whole election process and are corrupt to the core are somehow worthy of a vote. As Chris Hedges astutely pointed out in his book Death of the Liberal Class, there is no party that represents progressive values. There is no left. Indeed, there is no party on the right either. It has really become just one raucous party for the oligarchs.

&gt;In this election sponsored by transnational corporations and billionaires, no matter how independent politicians might appear in this staged democracy, they always come with strings attached. Trump is a phenomena created by the puppet masters behind the scenes, working on the emptiness at the core of American politics to prey on the vulnerable and those repeatedly betrayed by the system.

&gt;This can no longer be called speculation or wild imagination. WikiLeaks’ releases showed how the Clinton campaign conspires to “produce an unaware and compliant citizenry” with their strategy to elevate “Pied Piper” candidates like Trump as her primary ‘lesser evil’ leverage for winning. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Anybody who plans to vote for Hillary might want to do some due diligence by reading the summaries of the most revealing Podesta Emails.

I'm not the OP but I'll take a stab at this. 

If you assume that bad stuff happened but a conspiracy has successfully covered up all the evidence, you can believe whatever you want. She killed Vince Foster, she's secretly a lesbian, etc. A lot of the accusations against Clinton are as credible as 9/11 trutherism, and some of them come from the same people. On the other hand, if you actually care about what there's evidence of, she's a little too cozy with Wall Street and that's about it. I've linked to [this](http://mightygodking.com/2016/08/25/why-i-find-it-hard-to-be-worried-about-hillary-clinton-being-corrupt/) before and I think it's pretty good. The blogger comes at it from left of center, so he doesn't bother discussing the mass murders and waging war against America that she's often accused of, he's just focusing on allegations of corruption, pay-to-play, etc. Tl;dr version: it's reasonable to not like how hawkish she is or how cozy she is with Wall Street, but there's just no evidence of anything extraordinarily bad.

I googled your ""an unaware and compliant citizenry"" quote. You do know that you're taking it completely out of context, right?

Some politicians try to rely on people's awareness of what is important. I agree that they aren't very successful though.

The conflicting ideas in the dissonance are 1) that democrats are the well informed, well educated and well meaning ones while people voting for republicans are uninformed, dumb and evil, 2) democrats rely on their voters being ""unaware and compliant"" and ignorant of civics.

From what I have noticed liberal voters are much better at dealing with cognitive dissonance.

If the students think it's worth it, why not? The argument could be made that alot of the for profit colleges don't completely prepare people for work. Education only gets people so far. 

&gt; Given the incredibly blatant fraud by Trump, it's reasonable to assume those testimonials are frauds / bribed.

Or maybe most of the students just liked the program? Stop assuming the worst of people. 

&gt;Give a dollar amount to how much money Hillary has stolen from people. Taking a few shady campaign contributions is trivial. Literally every single politician in America has done this, including Trump, who took money from neo-Nazis.

How about the billions that her foundation took that was supposed to go to Haiti ? http://freebeacon.com/politics/haitians-protest-outside-hillary-clintons-office-over-billions-stolen-by-clinton-foundation/. Also, I said she was more corrupt. There are far more aspects to corruption than that. Yes, that includes taking funding from nations that funded ISIS but there's so much more than that. Having a public and private policy, paying people to incite violence at Trump rallies, failing to provide support for our troops in Benghazi, using a private email server to hide activity, then after being subpoena'd smashing the servers, then lying under oath saying she ""doesn't recall"" afterwards (unless she really is that forgetful, which might be a bigger problem) http://www.mediaite.com/election-2016/heres-all-40-times-hillary-clinton-told-the-fbi-she-couldnt-remember-something/ , asked about using executive privilege to cover up the emails, caught on audio saying she wanted to ""determine who was going to win"" the Palestine election, being in direct contact with department of justice during her investigation, getting the debate questions with Bernie Sanders in advance, rigging the primary against Sanders, laughing about getting someone she knew was a rapist off the hook, colluding with the media, constant record between her and Bill of putting in place policies that favor her big donors, Coordinating with SuperPACs.. The list goes on and on. She's the worst presidential candidate I've seen in my lifetime, that includes Trump. 

&gt;Cutting corporate taxes won't increase growth. There is no evidence whatsoever that cutting corporate taxes from 35% to 10% will increase growth. Especially given the fact that the effective corporate tax rate is 11%. He's talking (and lying) about cutting the rate to 10% and eliminating deductions, so an actual reduction of 1%.
His actual plan that he's lying about is to cut the corporate tax rate without eliminating the deductions effectively making the corporate tax rate a tax rebate, with the Feds giving corporations money.

Trump states he wants to reduce corporate tax to 15% (not 10%). Doesn't effective tax just mean the average tax rate paid?http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp eg. if it was 10% tax on income under $100, and 20% on taxes over that, and someone made $200, they'd pay $10 on the first $100, $20 on the second hundred, and and 15% effective tax. So effective tax rate should depend on the company (companies that make more have a higher rate). Where are you getting the 11% figure from, and how do you know he's lying about his plans to eliminate deductions?

&gt;What the USA needs is free college education. We need educated workers. Trump has said fuck all about education and the Republican party has been gutting American education for decades because they want stupid voters. Trump has actually bragged about how stupid his supporters are.

He simply was saying that he was ahead in the polls with many groups, also including the highly educated https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/24/donald-trump-loves-the-poorly-educated-and-just-about-everyone-else-in-nevada/

The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.""


&gt;Let me make this clear: Trickle-down does not work ever. Supply side economics are a proven failure 100% of the time. ""Chicago school"", ""free market"", whatever you want to call this radical ""eliminate all control and regulation on the rich and they'll shower us with money out of the goodness of their hearts"" philosophy it's total bullshit cooked up by the John Birch Society. You are being lied to by rich people that want to get even richer.

Don't you think at some point if we taxed the wealthy too highly it would result in reduced revenue? Why not tax them at 100%? Why not 85%? Eventually they'd decide it wasn't worth it or take their business elsewhere. Alternatively, if our rate is low enough, it might bring in business from other nations. We just happen to disagree on what the rate to bring in the most revenue is.

I expect this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I'm not totally against the idea of the wealthy keeping more of the money they make. Governments goal should be to benefit people, including the wealthy, not just to take in the max amount of revenue possible. Trump's plan is already taxing them at a higher rate, which IMO is reasonable. They're paying what I'd consider a""fair share"", they shouldn't have to pay all of it. 

&gt;""Americas greatest enemies love Trump"" is hardly a ringing endorsement. Actual US allies like the UK, Germany, Israel, etc. don't like him.

Maybe they wouldn't have to be enemies with Trump in office. IMO the last thing we need right now is another repeat of the cold war. You don't think it's possible that these leaders have ulterior motives for voicing opposition to Trump? Maybe they realize that once Trump gets in he's going to put America before special interests and other countries.

&gt;Number 6- Hillary's campaign wants ""unaware"" and ""compliant"" citizens


&gt;The Clinton campaign is literally conspiring to keep the population dumb and unaware (like sheep), and they admitted it! Very scary ‘1984’ level thinking. If Hillary is the right choice for president and the truth is on her side, wouldn't they encourage her supporters to research, like Trump tells his supporters?


They gather this conspiracy from an email some random person sent to John Podesta, and he's talking about how we as a society have been happy to allow political discourse to become so poor. I'll put the context for the claim below. The rest of the site is equally hilarious.

&gt;Dear John:    Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

We choose to ignore the glaring disparity and lack of access. We don't even try to help even the playing field. We use our privilege to fuck off to Europe while the poor fight for themselves.

"d93ybqg","Well that's an interesting question. Does wiping your memories also change your personality? Because in my opinion punishment for a crime should be conducted on a person, not on his/her body. As in, by removing your memories all together, you have effectively ""killed"" your past self and you are now beginning a new life. Punishing your new you for the actions of your past you seems as silly as jailing a son for the crimes of his father, if you put it in this context.

It all depends on the context of the memory wipe and how it affects the person. A completely full wipe of someone's memories would impact his behaviour and tendency of conducts massively, so that person is effectively a different person than the one that got his memories wiped. 

However if the memories deleted were just of this crime, I do think that the punishment is warranted. You forgot the actions you did? Yes, but the core values that pushed you to do them in the first place are still intact, and they deserve to get corrected and punished. 

Let's put it this way, if the police came knocking at my door and told me ""last week you killed 5 babies and an old woman, you are arrested"", and my first reaction was ""WHO THE FUCK AM I AND WHAT'S HAPPENING"", then I would feel pretty fucking cheated about getting taken away for a crime someone i am completely unaware and unfamiliar with did. If my reaction was, however, ""Well apparently someone wiped my memories of this but I did always hate those 5 babies and the old woman taking care of them"", I would have to shut up and take the punishment as it was well deserved. Would I feel fucked up and robbed? Sure, but I think the frustration would come more from not knowing who the fucked wiped my memories and why they did it more than wondering how is it possible that I murdered someone (assuming i already had murderous thoughts in the past and I do remember them).

Note: Yuri Bezmenov was a High Level KGB defector in 1970. He was the former lead KGB propagandist and he left Russia because he feared what was being done with something called Ideological Subversion. He laid out in these interviews from 1985 what it is and it's purpose. What struck him when he visited America was two fold one that this subversion had gone far and wide more full than the KGB could have hoped for and Second that the people committing the Subversion was Americas left. As he said "" It surprised me that it was Americans doing it to Americans"".  The Clinton emails show this in action and in my opinion one of the best examples is

&gt; Date: 2016-03-13 17:06

&gt; Subject: From Bill Ivey


&gt; Dear John:

&gt; Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats
and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its
time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump,
Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not. And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

&gt; Rubio's press conference yesterday AM was good and should be repeated in its entirety, not just in nibbles. I will attend the Clinton fundraiser here next week but as I can only afford the low level of participation may just get to wave without a ""hello.""

"d8v1l2g","Sources on population size? Just use Google. They'll be your first results in bolded text. As for sources on theory, check out the Federalist papers in their entirety. I also suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government for a more complete view of the philosophic context. Reading those with the Constitution as a companion is the only way to go. Sorry that's kind of broad, but it really is necessary to understanding the US government. 

If you're looking for sources on the growth of the federal government... well, they're evident all over the place. If you really want I can send you some links that try to quantify its growth, but I hardly think that's necessary. 

I'm afraid you're missing my point. Corruption in the United Stats isn't about population size alone -- it's about each branch and level of government having specific powers and duties. Checks and balances. Federal, state, and local governments constantly pushing and pulling at each other to ensure that no faction, no part of government becomes tyrannical. Federalism. 

How populations are represented in federalism, and the abilities people have to control their governments at various levels, are essential to the a federalist government's functioning.

I'm not at all making excuses for the rotten state of US politics; I'm lamenting that Americans have allowed the unholy alliance of special interests, federal (in colloquial parlance) politicians, bureaucrats, and activist courts to eviscerate the Constitution and the rights that it guarantees. 

Most people on both sides of the aisle don't have the faintest idea what Federalism accomplishes, nor do they understand how seriously imperiled their liberties have become in its effective absence.

Frustrated and stunted egoists, narcissists and megalomaniacs who simultaneously imagine themselves to be victims because the world doesn't bend to their entitled whims, or because they're brainwashed that they're historical victims (and are now opportunistically demanding personal reparations or vengeance for the alleged historical abuses) are the absolute worst abusers of power, because in their sick and stunted minds, everything they do is ""justified"" due to their ""suffering"" (the chosen-elect narcissist ""suffers"" when someone fails to lick their boots quickly enough).

And a lot of these feminist fanatics are either pathological narcissists with daddy issues, or they had some abusive male figure in their lives, and are now trying to get revenge through their power or their stooge ""muscle.""

It's interesting that Hillary's instincts when she had power over the amped-up mob were to incite it to follow the black dissident out to the parking lot and beat the shit out of him (and her sick shyster double-talk mind quickly came up with the Bolshevik-sounding euphemism ""stage an intervention"").

"d8fvxnt","IMHO, the stigma is based on location (genitals) and the double standard makes no logical sense, but there is a societal expectation to disclose if you are aware of a genital infection, and there is not a societal expectation to disclose if you have an oral infection, aside from abstaining during active outbreaks. Additionally, there is limited awareness that most people with HSV1/HSV2 are unaware and therefore unable to disclose. Same deal with HPV which can have more significant health consequences. 

AFAIK, the medical community is not at fault for this, though there is a case to be made that antiviral marketing (genital herpes scary, cold sores no biggie) played a role. I've seen references in literature to indicate that the medical community's stance was that the ability to freely share affection through daily affection such as kissing is more important to quality of life than limiting the spread of oral herpes, but condoms are a reasonable accommodation to reduce transmission of genital herpes and STIs in general. It's not that one is scary and one is not, it is that one accommodation is perceived as more reasonable in terms of affecting overall quality of life. And it probably seemed more reasonable back when they thought herpes was only contagious during outbreaks and outbreaks were assumed to be obvious. But that doesn't mean the discrepancy in recommended preventive measures is interpreted that way by society, including many people who don't even realize cold sores are herpes and that an oral herpes infection can be transmitted to the genitals. 

There was a time when there was a push for people to use barriers for oral sex as well but I see less of that now, perhaps because most people just won't do it, even though a number of STIs, including HSV and HPV, can be transmitted that way. IMO, most people would rather remain ignorant of those risks or ignore them in order to experience the sensation of not using barriers for oral sex. I'm one of those people myself, so I hope I'm not coming off as judgmental about it. 

Personally, I don't buy into the stigma of genital herpes being much different from oral herpes (aside from the stigma, of course) but I disclose my HSV2+ status to partners and allow them to make their own choice about it. To my surprise, I've found most people are very accepting. 

It does make me angry that the double standard exists, and I feel for those who feel intense shame and pain and isolate themselves as a result. But I also accept it's the society we live in for now. I have a couple friends who have held onto anger for decades after contracting HSV (in one case GHSV1, in one case HSV2) from partners who said they were unaware and I'd like to think that if I ever pass it along, as difficult as it would be for that partner, it might be less difficult than being blindsided. 

The fact is, most sexually active people can transmit herpes to a partner in one way or another, and most people aren't aware of that fact, so my feeling that I must disclose does strike me as odd sometimes, but I've made a decision to do so and I've been pleasantly surprised by the outcome.

Within months, I went from straight edge vegan virgin to homeless and being groomed for prostitution in exchange for drugs from an abusive man. I really can't find the words to explain how that's possible.

He would write to her occasionally to brag about all of the 13 year old pussy he was getting.

"d7zcmtu","/u/maryjanesandbobbysox points out something that jumped out at me as well and I'm not sure you took it as intended.  (Correct me if I'm wrong MJ)  

To elaborate, [Gaslighting](http://outofthefog.website/top-100-trait-blog/2015/11/4/gaslighting) is an attempt to control you by making you believe that your thoughts, emotions and even memories aren't what you know them to be.  MJ is quite correct that it's nothing short of severe emotional and mental abuse and people who have suffered at the hands of a clinical Narcissist go through significant PTSD and CPTSD.   I won't try to tell you how you feel...I just think you may not be quite clear on the distinction.  

It can be a fine line sometimes but from my perspective what you're describing is frequently contradicting herself in regards to sex in order to keep from doing it.

Gaslighting aside, she's clearly not working on the problem with you in good faith by dumping the onus of fostering desire entirely on you.

"d7vw2jv","I'd be fairly entertained by a potential lose-lose-lose-lose-extinction-level-event-lose scenario of y'all kicking the shit out of them Thursday and then have to face them in any round of your choice of the playoffs against a Brady who has gone so overboard in his vengeance-bloodlust that by week 14 he's wearing a necklace of severed ears (under the jersey, of course) and using his own blood as eye-black. At this advanced stage of locked-in mania that can only be self-induced by levying an unspeakable amount of death, suffering and despair upon your fellow man; Brady will just stand catatonic at the 50-yard line when not in possession of the ball, helmet on and eyes locked dead-forward to the invisible horizon in front of him, completely unaware and numb to any of the excitement happening right in front of him. He just..... *waits.* 

When it becomes time to revive his abomination, Belichick will appear to merely walk over and give his QB a measured bit of droll encouragement before he takes the field, but the people naive enough to be within earshot of Brady's immediate kill-radius have a fleeting moment of confusion when his words to Brady sound like a poorly tuned radio station that's bleeding into another station's signal. Nobody makes this comparison though since it's rare that a talk radio station's broadcast crosses signals between one station that broadcasts guttural insect sounds and another station that can only be described as someone shrieking slam poetry in an long-forgotten dead language. Besides the ""more intense and focused"" Brady, the only thing the fans and networks have noticed by this point is that every time after Belichick gives his brief ""pep talk"", Brady has this apparent weird ""nervous tic"" of having what appears to be a comically massive sneeze (to the amusement of millions nationwide) which starts with his eyes rolling back into his head and his mouth opening up to such a wide degree that it's almost as if his jaw is trying to tear itself off of his skull. The ""sneeze"" is made even more comically exaggerated as Brady seems to almost instantaneously bend backwards at the waist at a nearly 90-degree angle while what started out in Brady's distended jaw as a reasonably volumed ""ahhh"" one would have with a normal human sneeze has now crescendoed into an extended scream that would be better suited for someone suffering from being boiled alive instead of a high pollen count. The scream always climaxes with Brady's torso snapping forward 180 degrees as if his upper body was spring-loaded like a mousetrap. After a few weeks this comes off like a Laurel &amp; Hardy routine to the cameras as Belichick somehow *always* has a plush, high-absorbency towel in Patriots' throwback red at the ready about an inch where Brady's screaming face comes to a stop with a suddenness that gives even Roger Goodell pause about the possibility of a concussion. Belichick gives Brady a perfunctory pat on the back while the cameras instantaneously cut to a tight close-up of Bill's face as he issues a seemingly genuine smile of amusement. The entire fandom of the NFL is so enthralled by this rare sight of the infamously stoic coach week after week that it goes entirely unnoticed that Belichick is essentially running a draw play with the cameras in order to hand off the now blood-soaked towel to a nimble assistant who is already back in the locker room by the time the cameras cut over to Brady jogging to the line of scrimmage.

"d7m1nv7","I play with gen monks and pet wd as well, gen monks are squishy but it can certainly be done, I think as high as up to 105, I'll know where the limits are when I play with 3k+ gen monks.  I'd say I play with wizards the least, although it's partially because there aren't so many of them playing this season.  But the idea that I only run with wizards is a deeply incorrect assumption, especially when I have 100+ clears with gen monks, fb wds (3zdps) and pet wds.

I don't see the point in noting which particular types of dps buffs I lack if the overall result is that I'm still providing more damage.  I'd listen to an argument  revolving around that, maybe concerning pushing people to a break point via IAS.  But that ultimately needs to relate back to a firm superiority in dps provided, which as far as I'm aware, right now, does not happen.  Also, multi-shot wind chill rune provides an 8% crit chance buff, which runs contrary to your statement that ZDH provides no chc buff.

I'm also not sure why you think that either of the ZDH's damage mitigation sources, in guardian turret or in numbing traps, don't affect ranged projectiles?  Moreover, ranged damage is generally the far less significant source of damage, anyway.  It's usually floor stuff or melee, or melee one shots, that are the real threat to survivability.  Moreover, IP is god-like, but there's definitely an issue with this community feeling that it's absolutely essential.  From 90 up to 100+ I've encountered an endless supply of people who both feel that way, and are simultaneously so used to not ever having to move, that they actually don't move, and end up blaming a lack of damage mitigation on what is actually an extraordinary amount of really, really poor, unaware and non-reactive play.  IP is great, and it's essential for the top tier pushing, but it's definitely not essential for anything I've achieved or am still about to achieve, either in terms of pushing, or what I steadily farm.  For 3zdps I can do 98s with 4~ mins avg left night after night, for 2 zdps, working with often lower 2k para dps, it's more like 97s at the same pace.

I also have to say that most people seem to find barb's hard pull overrated.  I'm not saying it isn't amazing and a huge loss that the zdh takes, but a smart player can body pull VERY well, and zmonk can occasionally help pick up the slack by clearing a doorway etc, or a good group on TS can even reposition.  You'll still have runaways and bad rifts for openness which will highlight the importance of having hook, but at least in so far as closed up rifts are concerned - these aren't the types of rifts in which people are making limit breaking push progress to begin with, because they're universally shit rifts with narrowness and poor density.  When it comes to the open rifts you fish for to make push progress, zdh shines almost just as well as zbarb for pulling and density gathering.  It really has to be noted again that most people are pretty awful at body pulling and even most zbarbs I watch  are still garbage about hooking things as well.

I don't want to be off-putting with this suggestion, but based on some of the things you've said and the incorrect assumptions or statements that you've made about this char and where and how it fits into the meta, and what it can actually do.. I'm inclined to question whether you've ever played a ZDH?  I would guess at no since you're not perfectly familiar with the very few core skills and details of its damage buffing that are in place, and would have to encourage you to actually explore all of the details and even have a more hands-on experience with the characters limitation than merely theory crafting, and that, without full expertise and some initial misunderstandings about what the character in question even is or can do?  I'm just trying to be fair and logical here, nothing personal, but I think it's  a source of our not seeing eye to eye, and I think this is common in many, many people who have strong opinions about ZDH and whether they are relevant or not; people don't actually know what a ZDH can do, and is, either this season, or any season.  Moreover, what it can do in the hands of a highly skilled execution from someone with lots of experience and refinement to their approach to the role, build and skill choices etc.

There are a lot of incorrect assumptions from where you're coming from, and I appreciate you sharing them, but I've ultimately given you a strong list of reasons which you've variously been unimpressed by, dismissed, or actually misunderstood the truth of, only to pile on many more incorrect assumptions about the limitations of what I do, and only then to ask, why would anyone make time for this char?

I play with almost exclusively 2k+ para dps players, most often from Omega/Rogue/Target/Haven, and plenty of others from lesser known clans, and I get with the same people over and over again.  You might want to ask them why bother?  Or take solace in knowing that, they have some answer, that something is clearly working out okay there for them.  I'm not saying I ultimately allow them to farm or push in ways they can't already, but up to certain grift levels, I'm definitely not holding anybody back.  All I've done is play zdh up to 1300 para since just before the start of season 7.   I know the limits and what is efficient, and I don't much overstep it or drag others into that mistake with me.  If you're always able to find groups to speed farm 100+, then you wouldn't have much use for me.  But  that is honestly very, very few people.  If you don't have last seasons gem levels for your dps, and 2500+ para, you're probably not 'farming' much faster/higher than what I typically am.  I've also yet to really participate in any farming groups involving two truly high 3k+ dps, or a properly geared, last season gem'd FB wd for my 3zdps, or I would expect that I can farm 100 just about as well as anybody else is, at that point.  Also, relative to pushing, when I first cleared 100 I was still making some mistakes in my play w/ dps buffing that I've since cut out, and I cleared 100 as 3zdps, w/ a 2350 FB WD, and 5 full minutes to spare.  This was a pretty good rift, but it still could have been better.  I just want  it to actually be understood that there should be no doubt that 105 can be reached, if not higher.

The largest problem barring me from performing even better than I do right now, is a lack of access to 'stronger' players, which is, more than anything, purveyed by a near absolute lethargy and dismissiveness with respect to the idea of my build, the relevance of which I am, as can be seen from the leaderboards, essentially single-handedly pushing into view.  And it's not quite done.

Yes, you are right, the zdh is not as optimal as playing the the exact homogenous meta that everybody else is, but it's not very far off at all, especially when it comes to what anybody is actually farming.  The DPS of ZDH is genuinely not in question here, ZDH does fine for dps pacing, the bottleneck is where the survivability gives out and creates a limit of what can be efficiently done, strictly based off of what can be survived.

Plus, it's also really fun to actually be competing and achieving things, doing anything that is your own thing, instead of being a complete clone of everybody elses meta, and having pretty much nothing of a competitive achievement to pride yourself on, instead being player #237823 clearing many levels lower than the top of the leaderboards.  Yes, you aren't weighting for 'fun' as exists relative to other people, strictly efficiency, but I would honestly put to you the question of what the point is in playing a game where you're literally *only* interested in efficiency for the sake of para for the sake of... exactly what, in the end?  I'd be willing to wager that I'm having a lot more fun than you, and given what I'm typically farming, my efficiency is pretty damn solid and I doubt that it's even as much as 10% less than what you personally are achieving, if any less at all - depends on who you are and what you're reliably doing night after night.  I care greatly about efficiency - that is how I've come this far, with more left to refine and to accomplish :o",1473829047,"from 90 up to 100+ i've encountered an endless supply of people who both feel that way, and are simultaneously so used to not ever having to move, that they actually don't move, and end up blaming a lack of damage mitigation on what is actually an extraordinary amount of really, really poor, unaware and non-reactive play.","unaware and non","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and non","non",NA,NA,1

"d7c5t8z","Thank you for your question. The New Message from God reveals that we live in a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe. Humanity is an emerging world, a world in the difficult process of entering into this larger arena of life and beginning to engage with the Greater Community. 

As humanity undergoes this emergence, contact has begun, but it is contact of a complex and dangerous nature. An Intervention is underway in the world today by forces from beyond our world seeking to gain control of the resources of the Earth. This is the greatest threshold in human history yet people are unaware and unprepared. 

Humanity is the weak and divided steward of a rare gem in the universe — a world of biological wealth and diversity that we are destroying at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, humanity has great spiritual power and natural endowments which must protected, cultivated and brought forth. In the New Message this spiritual power is called “Knowledge,” which speaks of our innate ability to directly discern the truth. The New Message is here to ignite the experience of Knowledge in the human family, which will give humanity the power to face the great environmental, social and economic crises of our time and the immense challenge of emerging into the Greater Community as a free and sovereign world.

At the same time the Intervention works to undermine human freedom and sovereignty in our world, God has called upon an association of free races in our region of space to share their warning and wisdom with humanity in a series of briefings called The Allies of Humanity briefings. These briefings describe in detail the activities of the Intervention and the critical importance of Knowledge in the individual — the part of us that is beyond manipulation and influence of all kinds. You can read these briefings here: 
www.alliesofhumanity.org

I have come into the world as the first Greater Community Messenger — to proclaim the coming of the Greater Community and humanity’s emergence into this vast panorama of life. I have come to bring God’s revelation about life in the universe to humanity for the first time. God has spoken again to alert and prepare the human family for its emergence into the Greater Community of life in the universe. This is why I am here and this is part of what I bring.

I invite you to read the Revelation about humanity’s emergence into the Greater Community. Here God is telling each person and the world as a whole what must be done to prepare for this, the greatest of all thresholds in humanity’s evolution:

Yes of course it's the drivers primary responsibility that they operate the vehicle in a safe manner, but I don't believe anything he said was victim blaming.

"d6rnx8e","I agreed with everything u/lawdudette said and just wanted to add that the reason why it might seem like your friend values her two week peeps more than you is because of the primary Fe function.  I can't speak for everyone, but for me, I try to accommodate the other person by two ways: figuring out how they would like to be shown appreciation and by figuring out how serious our friendship is.  

For the first point, I try to understand them as a person.  Do they like PDA?  Are they comfortable with what how I plan to express my feelings for them?  Do they care about what people think of our relationship?  As a result, how I do show appreciation is heavily reliant on the other person. For the latter, I tend to over-romanticize / put more importance in the relationship I have with someone, so if the friendship is serious, I will be more hesitant to express my feelings to protect myself.  As ENFJs, we value genuineness, so we want our words to mean something when we talk to you.  If someone uses words freely and don't really mean it, it lets me do the same without worrying about how I come across.   As a result, when you see your ENFJ gushing about someone, it could be because that person made the first move and expressed appreciation so your ENFJ friend felt comfortable enough to express their appreciation with that person, but doesn't necessarily value that person more over the other.  Consequently, if someone is genuine and just so happens to be able to express their feelings freely, we will return the favor as well and mean it too. 

But we know what's real and what's not, as per u/lawdudette stressed.  Yeah, there may be a brief honeymoon period in the beginning when we get to know each other, but as soon as we know each other, we know what the nature of our relationship is. So even if your ENFJ is excitable with others, that doesn't mean that your friend is blinded by the compliments, but know how the relationship works.  

As long as your ENFJ friend is making efforts with you, you shouldn't worry about your worth to them.  Once you have a relationship with an ENFJ, it's hard to for them to have a negative opinion of you/let go. We tend to accept people as they are. 

Lastly, wanted to reemphasize u/lawdudette's point with your ENFJ friend pulling back if you are not receptive to new people. We notice how you react, even if you think you are discreet, and if that indicates toxicity, then we will distance ourselves.

Spirituality has been directly identified with religious contexts for the entirety of human history, and has only in the last several years, started to become disassociated, because people want to try to secularize it so as to keep the term around while making it seem harmless.

If a gameplaystyle is OP which requires very little skill there is something wrong with the game and there should be changes in the gamebalance, not by just excluding games played in that way from the ranking. I also think that not the ranking should not be based on skill, but winning, and that the game should be based on skill, so in this case if your other assumptions are correct, the problem should be solved on the game-side and not the ranking-side.

Absolutely, learning to helorush is a lot easier to do and execute to play at the ""same level""(lets define level as Elo- range for the purpose of this example) then normal gameplay, in terms of time needed.

However I think you underestimate skill needed to properly helorush. They are not the same skills needed for standard gameplay, but they are skills nonetheless. You need to come up with the deployment, the correct formation, very fast micro, correct responses to possible enemy deployments, types of responses to helorushes and the correct frequency to rush. 

The hardest of those is to adjust the correct frequency based on all the other factors.

Yes, you can just spam mi-25 and leftclick on the enemy spawn and get a decent amount of winrate vs an unaware and unprepared opponent, but to achieve the full potential of a helorush requires a lot of correct descisionmaking, in preparation and a lot of very fast descisionmaking, ingame (same applies for defending vs a helorush).

The counter argument is that your species has developed beyond ownership. That you are not property despite your accelerated evolution by the ""plaintiff.""

We reptilians and our allies took great pains to put an end to human slavery despite its horrific cost in human life as well as the vulnerability caused by the loss of states rights, knowing full well that it only opened up a greater opportunity for the Ael'Kayeen to direct the enslavement of humanity through orchestrated national debts via a corrupt international banking system.

We had hoped the influences of people like your Andrew Jackson would have prevented this occurrence or at least put it off for a few more years, until your technological development could allow you to use an information based, algorithmic currency, rather than one the banks could control or influence.

That did not happen in time. And such a currency here is in its early infancy and vulnerable to say the least.

So things changed. The current argument submitted before the Assembly is no longer that humans enslave each other through iron chains by those without conscience---but rather---through debt from an essentially valueless artificially created money supply.

The argument is, that it is in your natural nature to be enslaved and dominated by the crowning genetic achievement of their research and development, that is to say, humans without conscience; which the Assembly views as an entirely different subspecies than the majority of you.

Understand that whether you willingly allow yourselves to be enslaved, or accept the mantle worn by the masters of slaves, it doesn't matter by what means such slavery is devised... By such acceptance, you forfeit the right to be free creatures yourselves, and with it all birthrights associated with being born upon this world.

In other words, you can become property.

For the purposes of auditing the human species, and to make this name available in familiar language, I will call the sociopath Homo Toxicus so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

This has been confirmed by the findings of many other studies that, holding all other factors constant, the single most reliable predictor of whether someone will be sentenced to death is the race of the victim.

We had hoped the influences of people like your Andrew Jackson would have prevented this occurrence or at least put it off for a few more years, until your technological development could allow you to use an information based, algorithmic currency, rather than one the banks could control or influence.

That did not happen in time. And such a currency here is in its early infancy and vulnerable to say the least.

So things changed. The current argument submitted before the Assembly is no longer that humans enslave each other through iron chains by those without conscience---but rather---through debt from an essentially valueless artificially created money supply.

The argument is, that it is in your natural nature to be enslaved and dominated by the crowning genetic achievement of their research and development, that is to say, humans without conscience; which the Assembly views as an entirely different subspecies than the majority of you.

Understand that whether you willingly allow yourselves to be enslaved, or accept the mantle worn by the masters of slaves, it doesn't matter by what means such slavery is devised... By such acceptance, you forfeit the right to be free creatures yourselves, and with it all birthrights associated with being born upon this world.

In other words, you can become property.

For the purposes of auditing the human species, and to make this name available in familiar language, I will call the sociopath Homo Toxicus so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

The overwhelming majority of the human species would, by comparison, be akin to something like Homo Somnius: in that you are sleeping, underdeveloped, unaware, and inferior.

The globalized feminization of the male of the species guarantees that there shall be no violent or risky opposition. 

In other words, you are being both castrated and fattened for the slaughter.

If you do not take a stand against this human subspecies, and their plans for global dominance, you will be harvested.

Hundreds of millions of you will be pulled into the void, and vanish without a trace.

Some players just like to relax and go at a soft pace, making decent gold without much thought or effort, it is a game after all. 

Others only find things enjoyable when they are done at their most efficient (or as close to as is reasonable). They strive for excellence even if it is just a game and are entertained by how close they can get to the optimum.

The nature of multiloot squads however is that generally having a substantial mix of both groups of people will lead to players in the second group being disappointed whereas those from the first group would remain unaware and happy. More vocal people in the second group try to prevent this from happening by advocating techniques to shift the squad towards their interests. 

Fortunately it is up to the commander to decide what type of squad they want. If you want a laid back group, just say so, if people still insist on spreading dissent then kick them. If you want a more efficient group then perhaps change your lfg details, maybe write a concise explanation of squad rules a few mins before meta starts and feel free to kick people who refuse to co-operate.

But not before first calling the gf, asking her why she wasn't invited and declares she's going to come regardless. How is this outlandish behaviour considered acceptable? 

&gt;He tried to illustrate a depth of hurt and people are using it as a character attack on his mother as if it's the gospel truth.

The reasons the gf may have for not inviting the mother might be more intricate and telling. OP is hopelessly unaware and uninformed about why his gf did this, once he finds out he can figure out best how he wants to move forward. Without this critical piece of information we will not know. However, characterizing a young woman's choice to not invite her bf's mother to a party thrown by her family members as a *selfish cow* is not okay. 

&gt;people are saying it's the OPs job to support his GF even if she's wrong, even if she's being selfish and unreasonable and dissing his family. Wrong. His GF is being a selfish, narcissistic person who is not considering the needs of HIS CHILD in the long term and he doens't have to support her in that.

At some point, OP needs to cut the imaginary umbilical cord and realize that this ""woman"" is the **mother of his child** not his mother. So it is imperative that he takes her seriously and hears her side/reasons for doing so because for the next 18 years, they are in this together. They aren't married at this point so they need to be able co-parent successfully **she** will be raising the child with him, not his mother.

I merely asked for your definition of communism so we have a place to work from. So many people call any use of social services communism, which just isn't true. I'm curious if you consider stuff like food stamps and social security communist ideas. Where do we draw the line when it comes to the government's responsibility to care for its people?

If we look at some more information on [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), we see that it is also considered ""a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state."" So a communist society has no money, classes, or state. This is incredibly far removed from our current culture and the goals expressed by any notable politician.

I'm not going to address Marxist feminism, because that is honestly the first time I ever heard the phrase, and the pay gap between genders is a lot more complicated than either side likes to admit. To really discuss the pay gap, we would have to address cultural gender norms, subconscious biases by employers, work environments, maternity leave, and a slew of other considerations. 

Basic Income and Communism are not really related at all. Basic income merely seeks to provide necessities in a more efficient way than our current welfare systems. To effectively argue against basic income, you'd have to argue that all other forms of welfare are also communist. All of the programs seek to provide basic necessities. Basic Income relies on capitalism. It actually provides more freedom than other forms of welfare because it doesn't dictate *how* a person should spend their money. Basic Income also requires a capitalist society with money to work, which is contrary to communism.

It doesn't matter to me if Sanders calls himself a communist or not. But I do not feel like he has called for any kind of communist ideals. He merely seeks to lessen the wealth inequality that has increased dramatically over the last few years. The [current level of inequality](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/11/daily-chart-2) is roughly equal to the inequality we saw right before the Great Depression.

#In a land far, far, far away, beyond the Narrow Sea and the Seven Kingdoms, a trio of women played a social game of wits. 

These three witches churned their cauldron, as they muttered, “Double, double toil and trouble -- fire burn, and caldron bubble.” Of course, a Famous Fish *misquoted* the above line to say “boil, boil, toil, and trouble” but the quote remains apposite. The three witches possessed a majestic force, with beauty beyond compare. Many whispered about their status in legend, which weaved a tapestry of intrigue and ill-will in the land of blistering heat. **Although three men are labelled Friends and Comrades, three women are maligned as villains**. Three enchantresses with tresses that hid their ambition.

The leader was a tall woman whose golden locks and beguiling smiles commanded the hearts and minds of those who once underestimated her. A veritable **idol** and paragon, who stood like a Grecian statue above the fray. The second was a dark-haired conspirator, who leapt at the shadows and held the first **rock** to be cast onto the enemy. After all, she would betray anybody for one more day to play the game -- and she played to win. The third was a creature of pure **spectacle** and magic that scorch the earth upon which braceleted foes stood. Assisted with magic, the smallest of women can become a dragon.

While the underestimated leader and the magical spectacle have their believers and acolytes who will defend them to the ends of the earth, the dark-haired conspirator remains vilified, crucified to the stake of “playing to win”. After all, this witch *dared* to endeavour for the stars that only golden men and bounty hunters were allowed to reach. **Brawn and Friends can ask for collusion**, but a dark-haired girl *must* accept her allotted position and fall onto the savage sword. No matter the children who wait at home for her or her gentle smiles outside of the tribal arenas, a girl has no name.  To the stake, a girl must burn with the flames of her revilers. 

Indeed, the dark-haired conspirator dared to unseat the natural order. Armed with vim and verve, this girl approached the crone whom many consigned to the death-row’s lot. All but few had already determined that the crone would not outlast the many golden men with their savage swords. The crone was weak and unbeknownst to her, valuable to none. **But when the dark-haired girl asked the crone to work with her for a mutual benefit, the revilers screamed and declared that the girl must burn.** Whether the girl was right had little importance. Whether the crone herself *liked* the girl held even less significance. No, a girl must accepted her place in the shadows of men, and if she dares cast a stone, the witch must burn.

Later on, the crone regretted trusting the men with savage swords. When her favourite man heeded the words of the Egotist Goat, the crone fell into the cliffs and missed the final place of the stars. To the witch’s revilers, the crone whimpered that perhaps the witch was right: some men cannot be trusted. That sometimes, games must be played with the intention to win. **But nay, nobody would listen, because a savage sword is just, and a girl must never dare to presume.** Women with their simple brains behind dark locks do not comprehend that they must giggle, laugh, and resign to their fates.

Although a girl has no name, this dark-haired one once had a name that many could see. And her name… was **Brianna**.

#539. Brianna Varela (16th place, Guatemala) 

In this particular case, Brianna tried working with the older Lydia. However, Rafe and the Egotist Stepheme had control of Yaxhá, including Lydia’s own vote. Brianna scrambled and tried to get Lydia out. Because Brianna lacked the social finesse and *likeability* of other players ~~such as Ciera Eastin~~, **Brianna fell flat on her face and was never mentioned ever again**. What a truly pointless “witch”, and that entire Guatemala trio of premerge girls can easily get out of this rankdown without much tears. Rafe and Brian wielded their savage swords, the women fell into place, and in the end, the trio of girls went out consecutively. 

At least Lydia grew into her own person and started to play towards the end. She has that trait in common with several other players. Indeed, Lydia was likeable, fell onto the right side of every post-merge vote, and was ultimately cut because the Egotist Goat didn’t trust her. Thus is the story of Lydia, who was *far* more relevant than Miss “Make-Up” Varela. I mean, this girl is so ridiculous: she claims that she has manifold “social skills”, but unlike a Ciera, she doesn’t know when she should listen and play nice. **Truly irrelevant** and unaware and strategically inept. For example, **Exhibit A:**

[Do you need $285 wrinkle cream? Do you? Let’s be honest. You do!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvvnaAZEkX0) And I'll tell you why: that's my job! I sell women... what they don’t need. 

Do we need Brianna Varela in this Rankdown? Do we? Let’s be honest. We **don’t**! And I’ll tell you why: that’s my job! I sell rankers… that what they don’t need, **should be discarded with the trash**.

It's far more complicated.
The Ael'Kayeen claim ownership of the human genome in much the same way you humans might claim ownership to a gene sequence used in the treatment of say... Cystic Fibrosis, for example.
The counter argument is that your species has developed *beyond* ownership. That you are **not** *property* despite your accelerated evolution by the ""plaintiff.""

We reptilians and our allies took great pains to put an end to human slavery despite its horrific cost in human life as well as the vulnerability caused by the loss of states rights, **knowing** full well that it only opened up a greater opportunity for the Ael'Kayeen to direct the enslavement of humanity through orchestrated national debts via a corrupt international banking system.

We had hoped the influences of people like your Andrew Jackson would have prevented this occurrence or at least put it off for a few more years, until your technological development could allow you to use an information based, algorithmic currency, rather than one the banks could control or influence.

That did not happen in time.
And such a currency here is in its early infancy and vulnerable to say the least.

So things changed.
 The current argument submitted before the Assembly is no longer that humans enslave each other through iron chains by those without conscience---but rather---through debt from an essentially valueless artificially created money supply.

The argument is, that it is in your *natural nature* to be enslaved and dominated by the crowning genetic achievement of their research and development, that is to say, humans without conscience; which the Assembly views as an entirely different subspecies than the majority of you.

Understand that whether you willingly allow yourselves to be enslaved, or accept the mantle worn by the masters of slaves, it doesn't matter by what means such slavery is devised... By such acceptance, you forfeit the right to be free creatures yourselves, and with it all birthrights associated with being born upon this world.

In other words, you can become property.

For the purposes of auditing the human species, and to make this name available in familiar language, I will call the sociopath *Homo Toxicus* so that it will have its origins in the ancient Greek reference for poisoned arrows, and that you might understand what their utilization is by the Ael'Kayeen.

The overwhelming majority of the human species would, by comparison, be akin to something like *Homo Somnius:* in that you are sleeping, underdeveloped, unaware, and inferior.

The globalized feminization of the male of the species guarantees that there shall be no violent or risky opposition. 

In other words, you are being both castrated and fattened for the slaughter.

If you do not take a stand against this human subspecies, and their plans for global dominance, you will be harvested.

Hundreds of millions of you **will** be pulled into the void, and vanish without a trace.

"d3ev3ic","BTW, you'll probably find this little article interesting as well:

http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20140523/prostate-cancer-std

Note the last paragraph of that abbreviated article:

&gt;This latest research is not the first to link the infection with prostate cancer. A 2009 study in the Journal of the National **Cancer Institute found that 23% of men with prostate cancer showed signs of trichomoniasis.**

Of course the mainstream medical community ""poo poos"" that as ""not a CLEAR link"".  The thing is that not all ""prostate cancers"" are alike, in fact most of them are such slow-growing things that the best treatment turns out to be ""no treatment"" -- i.e. you die WITH some (non-malignant, non-metastatic) prostate cancer, not FROM it.  

But there are OTHER kinds of prostate cancer... generally called ""aggressive"" -- those are the kind that KILL men (i.e. they die -- often fairly young -- FROM the cancer {and/or the  &amp; complications of it, that attempts to eliminate or ""cure"" it}, not just WITH the cancer).  And interestingly enough -- guess which kind of prostate cancer OTHER research has linked *trichmoniasis* with?  Yup: *[""Aggressive Prostate Cancer Linked to Trichomonas""](http://www.medpagetoday.com/urology/prostatecancer/15888).*

Thus that 23% is in fact FAR more meaningful than it seems/sounds at first glance.

--

Now, note that the infecting agent in this case is **not** a virus, but rather a **parasite (specifically a ""protozoan"")** that goes by the name *[Trichomonas vaginalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomonas_vaginalis)* and which causes a disease called *[Trichomoniasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomoniasis)*.

Now if from that name (the ""vaginalis"") you too away a clue that the disease is most NOTABLE in... the vagina; well you'd be right about that.  In fact, it's apparently normally ""asymptomatic"" in men (i.e. they're infected and don't suffer any ""acute"" symptoms or disease, no puss discharges, no warts or lesions or even a rash); whereas in women, well... 

Also relevant to that 23% is the fact that it infects women at about TWICE the rate of men. And *in the US,* estimates are that about 5 million people are infected with it each year -- it is in fact THE single most common ""protozoa/parasite"" infection in western nations.  Consider that 5 million figure across a normal human lifespan (especially the post-pubescent, and the main ""sexually active/promiscuous"" decades) of about say 30 to 40 years (i.e. age 20 to 50; or age 15 to 55) ... and you end up with a bit more than half of the US population (probably around 60%); 2/3 of that being women, and 1/3 of it being men (i.e. that's how a 2:1 ratio of infection plays out)... now 1/3 of 60% is... ~20% of the MALE population.

**Also of note** is that even though it *is* THE most common ""parasitic/protozoan"" infection, and it is most definitely a ""sexually transmitted"" critter...  ""trich"" (as it is called in the medical industry) is in fact **NOT one of the ""standard STD panel"" tests** that people usually obtain from ""clinics"" or family doctors, etc. (The ""standard"" STD panel is a 5 disease set: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes 2, HIV Antigen/Antibody {aka ""Aids""}, and Syphilis\*).  

So if a woman is infected with it (again estimate of 5 million cases in the US each year, about 2/3 of those women) -- well unless she is experiencing some relatively EXTREME symptoms, she will probably remain unaware... unaware AND infectious. *(Mmmmm, going down on some random ""Tinderella"" chick sounds ever so much more FUN when you realize you might be swallowing some of THOSE little protozoans, doesn't it?  And then say 10 to 30 years later: BAM, aggressive prostate cancer!)*

--
Now of course if you yourself were not only non-promiscuous, but your SOLE lifetime partner was likewise non-promiscuous (both before meeting you AND becoming your intimate partner) -- then your ""risK' would *virtually* zero (i.e. almost but not quite; because there ARE non-sexual ways that such things can be transmitted, including from mother to child).  Thus, once again we return to ""ancient"" knowledge and practices... and can see why men would have (evolved/adapted) a preference for young/virgins as the best potential wife material.

---

\* Note that **a lot of OTHER oncogenic (cancer causing) STD's are also notably absent from that standard panel;** including HPV (Human Papilloma Virus -- technically ""virsuses"" since there are HUNDREDS of ""types"" of HPV, most of which essentially *cannot* be tested for, and no ""general antibody marker"" will help, because HPV types also includes things like common hand warts {aka *Veruca Vulgaris*} which just about everyone gets infected with {via handshake or other skin-skin-contact}).

When it comes right down to it, the entire ""get tested regularly"" bit regarding STD's creates a significantly *dangerous* false picture; the plain truth of the matter is that the vast majority of different KINDS of STD's have no ""test"" whatsoever -- and of course that is just the infectious agents (bacterial, parasites, viruses) that we KNOW about, and KNOW are transmitted via ""sexual"" (intimate) contact.  There is quite probably a whole vast array of infectious agents out there -- including many that are likely to be both sexually-transmitted AND ""long fuse"" -- and yet which (like ""trichmoniasis"" in men) do not present with any ACUTE disease symptoms, and because of that have been considered *innocuous* and ""mostly if not entirely harmless.""

"d39huvx","I was Team Moneybags, I mean Iron Man, when I went in mostly because I preferred his side of heroes and could understand his idea. That being said I also understood Cap's point of view.

I actually left still being a Moneybags fan but seriously waning on both. I feel like Iron Man took a subpar deal with the UN. I feel like they could have arranged a far better deal for themselves and worked out the arrangements with the UN if they discussed it with them. The idea of folding immediately felt really annoying. The escape of Bucky was a clear indication that the UN were unaware and unsure of what was going on but Iron Man was too blinded to think with his infinite mind that something else might be going on. The Part 3 of the movie where Iron Man sticks it to Ross felt really good because it felt like what Iron Man would really be like under the UN however the final fight felt forced and made me lose most of my faith in Iron Man as he succumb to his own trauma.

While I prefer Captain America's ideals in the movie I am conflicted as why he went that way. Rather than try to broker a happy medium he went completely off on his own. He feels less like a leader and more like a desperate soldier unwilling to give up the fight. Take for example his belief that Bucky was in trouble after realising the psych was not right. Rather than immediately take it to Iron Man/Widow who was on the same level as him at the time he proceeded straight down to save Bucky. While heroic, had he presented his thoughts to Iron Man's side immediately its likely the entire civil war could have been avoided as Widow or Iron Man would have likely understood his logic.

There are multiple more points but I think the general point that made me stay Team Moneybags is the fact that Black Panther and Iron Man feel like leaders throughout most of the film. They feel like they should be in charge while Captain America is running around like a headless chicken doing what he wants when he wants and not caring what conflict he starts. He feels bullheaded and irresponsible but Iron Man's excessive critical thinking and willingness to bend to the government also make him frustrating. He shows a ray of hope towards the end but ultimately falls. If it wasn't for Black Panther's ending scene's where he displayed his growth and decision making as a leader I probably would have swapped sides.

Perhaps I did swap to the third option of being Team Panther in the end?",1463527798,"the escape of bucky was a clear indication that the un were unaware and unsure of what was going on but iron man was too blinded to think with his infinite mind that something else might be going on.","unaware and unsure","unaware","and",FALSE,"unaware and unsure","unsure",NA,NA,1

You've hit the heart of the issue, for me. Well, not actually for me, (I'm all about self-driving cars. But philosophically I think it's interesting.)

When self-driving cars are the norm, the number of accidents will dramatically decrease. However, the distribution will become more-or-less random. With people driving, car accidents aren't like the weather: an attentive and defensive driver will have a lower incidence of car accidents. Of course there are things that are entirely out of the driver's control, but that universe is smaller than most people like to admit.

This is why car insurance premiums are lower for better drivers. 

With self driving cars, though, it's no longer a factor of your personal responsibility towards being a good driver, it's merely a numbers game of what random combination of factors will overwhelm the computer(s) and cause an accident. While a fender bender is no big deal, what about fatal accidents? Is it fair that if you had been behind the wheel, you would've been able to navigate the situation better, or avoided it entirely?

Personally, I think the answer is ""yes it is fair."" Sure, maybe you would live in that situation. But you also benefited from a lifetime of safer voyages, and maybe one of those times you wouldn't have been able to avoid the accident. You also benefited from a lifetime other people not getting in as many accidents; while you may be a safe driver, what about your husband? What about your 16 year old kid? 

Still, personal responsibility is one of the more bedrock principles we've built our society on. I'm curious to see how people react to self-driving cars once they become a reality.",1463018582,"&gt; [people are by and large absolutely dreadful, unaware, and overly aggressive drivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?","unaware, and overly","unaware","and",TRUE,"unaware , and overly aggressive","aggressive",NA,"overly",1

[Germany was home to about 500,000 Jews as of 1933,](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005276) which was less than 1% of the German population. I'd say its safe to assume the Jews lived in concentrated areas, meaning that the majority of Germans wouldn't know any Jewish people. 

The Germans had some idea of what was happening, but for the most part, you wouldn't really notice if 1% of your area's population was sent away, and you probably wouldn't care to find out if you were busy with your every day life.

And the question is still ""did the general population accept it?"" Well, they had been taught to hate the Jews, to think they were destroying the country, etc. But if the Nazis had just come out and said ""We are planning on brutally murdering Jewish children"" the population surely wouldn't have accepted it.

I was unable to watch this live, so I just caught up now and holy balls was that a great episode. I'm super sad I didn't get to watch it with all of you - however I took some notes and I have some questions.

First off, it appears the oil rig is just one giant yoga studio. If this wasn't in the middle of a war and some dumb AI wasn't trying to kill the entire world, I would totally want to live on that oil rig. 

Second, I really like that we have had some more visuals into the CoL. It also amuses me that Grounders or other warrior type people are seen in v-neck sweaters and slacks. Hilarious. It sort of made me feel that the CoL some how represents Corporate America. Everyone is just walking around until they are called upon to do a task. They are dazed and unaware and ignorant. It's just a stark difference between CoL and Earth, which at some point, I'm sure used to look similar to CoL, so it's just interesting how these places have switched roles. 

Monty and Harper - Glad to see another relationship kindle. However, this basically means one of them is going to die. Fun times. My favorite part is when Raven walk in on them afterwards and was like '*finally*'. 

When I saw ALIE on the oil rig, I nearly fell off my chair. That was of course after Luna foreshadowed that who ever was causing the trouble, would not find their way to her rig. Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. 

God damnit Jasper... I feels for you. You always fall for the heroes. Shay and Maya both saved Clarke to have her continue on her crazy journey. Clarke is damn lucky Jasper finds these girls.

The MOMTY scene was so sad. That bitch ALIE would use his mother's voice - even though it was that dickhead Jaha's idea. He's so EVIL. Seeing Raven cry nearly broke me. Great scene.

Also, anyone else notice the way Indra was holding that gun? What was she going to do with it? Swing it at people. Haha should have taken those gun touting lessons from Kane when she had the chance.

I was totally yelling at Clarke to not drink the drink. SHE JUST SAID STAY SHARP. Hasn't the whole drinky drinky thing happened before? You would think they would learn. fuck.

So, questions since my mind exploded towards the end. 

- Is it assumed that where they showed ALIE was the Ark? Like the dead thing flying out in space? 

- Why would she want to go to the Ark? And why wouldn't she be able to be stopped from there? Couldn't Raven just hack into that thing that they have in Titus' tech house of horror? 

- There two major attempts to shut ALIE down - Raven finding the kill switch, and Muphy and Pike destroying Dora's backpack backpack. Of course NEITHER would work. But, what does this migration mean and why was it needed? And why doesn't she need the backpack anymore?

tl;dr - This episode was tits. I love this show.

There I was,  completely unconsious with her riding me and what not.   At first I was pissed but then i figured I probably... nay... Definitely, would have slept with her if I wasn't so drunk anyway so I just shrugged it off and moved on.   

I still think it's pretty weird though and occasionally I reflect on that experience and feel a bit uneasy.

"d2qp8jx","&gt;  I am not directly commenting on that, more about you. in general I don't understand any of your logic despite your moniker.

Because there is no logic to be found. This ""logical lead"" is profoundly ignorant to the social and cultural reality of rape and sexual violence in the US. They are also speaking from a place of unrecognized privilege by trying to police the behavior and response of survivors. This is particularly noticeable when you look at sexual violence prosecution and the strict standards of criminal court that makes a near impossible barrier to successful prosecution and can actually cause more psychological harm to a survivor.  The blatant appeals to authority and the legal system is a fundamental failure to understand the criminal versus civil justice systems, the differences in standards between them and the relationship of those standards and laws with regards to sexual violence.  The argument being made also shifts the onus of the pursuit of justice and future prevention of sexual assaults onto the survivor. 

Ultimately, this blogger comes across as someone who is utterly unaware and uninvolved in victim advocacy, sexual violence prevention and other work relating to it. If they are aware, then they are actively damaging the causes they think they are supporting. Survivor and anti-sexual violence advocacy is about supporting survivors first, introducing awareness to the crimes and how they are committed (e.g. not stranger danger), changing the culture around believing survivors and changing the culture around sex in the US. While it sounds nice to advocate more police involvement, it is feel good nonsense because, of highly likely committed rapes reported to authorities, less than 10% will even be referred to prosecutors. This is due to a large confluence of factors, including discrimination, the circumstantial nature of most rape evidence, the short time frame in which physical evidence can be obtained and cultural shaming of rape and sexual violence survivors.  The blogger's post violates so many basic tenants of being a good supporter of survivors, it's mostly just sad. The post isn't about survivors, it's about punishment and generating controversy. 

The lack of understanding isn't going to go away, they keeps posting this kind of stuff and they use tactics, like false advocacy and the ""abuse"" moniker, to avoid and shield themselves(and their argument) from criticism. Their response is to turn back and attack you for not being an advocate or not wanting to see justice. There is always a place to shift the goalpost unfortunately and this person sees their post as some sort of journalism.

"d2llluc","Hey there, this is a really interesting question and I’m going to do my best to answer it from what I’ve picked up here.

You will find what I’ll refer to as “clumsy stupid racism”, something which outside of a few communities is rare where I’m from (and I’d hope most of the US). So for example you might have a student say *“why are you black?”* or *“Are you from Africa?”* which you might just find absurd- although I’m not going to second guess your experience.

 I have a friend here of mixed heritage who comes from a similar part of London that I do, students are permanently perplexed at what they see as an irreconcilable blend of posh English and their own perceptions of skin colour. Although, they are unaware that what they say is inappropriate and its definitely our job to put them right.

Another factor is that these are students using English out of context, often only in school and never within a society. So it’s not un-common for them to pick up language from entertainment and throw it around without real thought as to its implication. Often it’s pretty vanilla like using “Shit” or “Fuck” where not appropriate, but I have heard racial slurs used. When confronted however they seem totally unaware and often ashamed that they would be considered racist, which due to their history, is a big deal here.

Hiring wise, don’t forget that a lot of people doing the hiring here are Westerners so it should be fine.  I’ve seen people from all backgrounds teaching here and it’s easy to meet people. The heinous racists I’ve had the mis-fortune of meeting are ridiculously shallow and only spouted their filth to me because of how I look (shaved head, white dude).

Despite there being room for me to improve physically, I make certain that things that can readily be ""on point"" are, such as having good hygiene, and making certain that I'm presentable when I'm trying to achieve something.


Everyone accepts a certain role in life: some will choose to take things to heart, and allow themself to weighted down, and others won't. The tough part is changing one's role. You don't suffer from an eating disorder because life calls for you to have it or because life calls for you to be perfect, you have an eating disorder, because at this point, you've chosen to allow yourself to be weighed down by life. When one is younger (I'm assuming you're grown), one can use being inexperienced, unaware, and naive, to justify doing things that are detrimental to them, but as we get older, and learn that there are resources available to help oneself and are able to use rational, cognitive thinking, still being oppressed by things like eating disorders becomes less and less of a victim's battle, and more of a choice. 


I'm sure that you've lived enough life to see that no one is perfect, that people who have many imperfections are successful at relationships and life, and that you can see that strongholding your eating isn't going to make you perfect, and in fact has the opposite effect. At this point, you're giving in to the part of your mind that's screaming the loudest, but is the most irrational, and it's time that you stop! In life, we come across situations that require us to play mind over matter, and unfortunately, this is your battle. But, the only way to win, is to not let the thoughts that suggest that disordered eating is appropriate, a solution, or ok. Everytime your mind says give into disordered eating, you inundate it with reasons why disordered eating is uncalled for, inappropriate, and unnecessary, and that you're not going to do it. 


You're only a victim when there's nothing you can do to avoid that action, but you can avoid it, you just have to be diligent and mindful. I wish you all the best with your battle, and I hope that you allow cognitive thinking to guide you, instead of irrational. Also, I would definitely seek counseling for your victimized thought processes. To even allow sentiments like, ""I am a man though and it doesn't count so I try not to bring it up.

Ethnic identity is not founded in a simple binary of black and white. Our individual identity is both a social and a subjective construct. As an example (away from the socially-charged subject of ethnicity) if a child was raised by dogs the child would perceive itself as part of a canine pack. 
In my country, (getting back to the socially painful subject of ethnicity) indigenous people who are perceived by their community as indigenous and who self-perceive as indigenous are challenged (challenged being a euphemism for what can be a painful, humiliating and outrageous experience given our history) to prove who they are because, on specular and binary terms, 'they look too pale'.

You are correct in the idea that many yoga teachers are unaware and uneducated about K. That's why Kundalini Yoga, and especially the team that was taught by Yogi Bhajan are so relevant - they are numerous, and not clueless about K.  

There is no particular reason you'd need to go to China, India or anywhere else. You may have to cross provinces or states, or even to the far side of a continent.   

In China, you'd likely need to learn some Chinese. In India, the British colonisation means that many speak English. A bonus.   

I'm told by Indian people living here in Canada, (And have read similar things on-line), that finding real spiritual teachers has become a big problem in India. Not impossible, just a lot harder than it was. One spiritual teacher in India who does YT videos says there may be as few as 6 real teachers, (What he calls *real* teachers may be quite extreme), in all of India. He states maybe 100 in Japan within their mainly Zen culture. I forget what he says beyond that for other areas and cultures. Poor buddy is lonely.  

You can do years of Hatha Yoga without worry. There's no absolute need for them to be familiar with K. It's damn helpful if an advanced student comes along and their Kundalini stirs. There are teachers in the West who are qualified. It's your requirement (A hoop to leap through), to be able to both find them and choose one who you find compatible with who you are and your life circumstances.   

I've never met a Kundalini person / teacher who referred to themselves as a Master. The students might call them that, but never the teachers. Be aware of that. That's true of teachers who have started to ""pass on what they have learned."" They may seem a little greenish and speak in a funny accent, or not! Smiles.  

Far from the internet - yes, I hope you get the chance to do a retreat of some kind at some future date, if you ever wish to do that. It's quite worthwhile. Just be honest on the application form!  

My *you are not yet ready* message implies that you are not ready to meet a teacher NOW. It's too soon. Get those skills and experience started at least. You'll find a list of ideas in those Supporting Practices in the Wiki.

I am saying that self-reports are not the be-all and end-all measures of human experience *especially* regarding motivation. People are quite good at knowing and expressing what they like and dislike. However, they are absolutely abysmal at describing their arousal and motivations. That's why physiological measures of arousal and motivation, like skin conductance responses, EEG, facial EMG, cardiac, etc., are used by emotion and motivation researchers.  

People may lie about their motivations, but it's often not a case of lying, but of being unaware and unable to verbalize because motivation goes on below conscious awareness.

"d1q6tsr","Everyone is downvoting you but I think they forget that downvoting genuinely helpful and constructive posts is pointless.

You are a secondary opinion and you are saying things in a constructive way focused on helping OP come to terms with what happened and giving her an alternate perspective.

I don't like how everyone is disregarding you just because they disagree.

I personally agree somewhat with you that it seems shady but mostly because of what happened after she fell asleep. You'd think they'd begin to sober up after hours of not drinking and simply having sex/expending energy, and instead they were still going at it for lord knows how long while OP was blissfully unaware and asleep.

A drunken ""finish up"" probably means ""stop so we can sleep"" rather than ""keep going for over HALF AN HOUR."" She slept around 0230 (probably a bit earlier) and woke up around 0300. A half hour is a long time to ""finish up."" That just was unsettling for me, especially  how they completely disregarded OP when she woke up. 

Imagine nobody was drunk in the situation and they were all having a threesome. One person falls asleep and says finish. They wake up half an hour later and the other two are still going. They get up and walk across the room to go to the bathroom and not once do the two ever stop or even slow down to acknowledge the first person. It's just bad threesome etiquette in general.

Also *by this point, blackout drunk OP had sobered up enough to realize how messed up all of this was.* Yet they weren't sober enough to think ""maybe sex one-on-one for this long is a bad idea?

&gt;Blaming everyone else for your problems in a tremendously unaware and hypocritical fashion isn't being honest about emotions at all. It's the complete opposite. It's someone who is incapable of coming to terms with their insecurities so has instead created a fantasy world where all of his own problems are actually everyone else's fault. (Or more specifically, roughly 50% of everyone else.)

I described that as ""nice guy thinking""

Now you are saying that ""nice guy thinking = self-realization"" which is the exact opposite of what I said.  

""recognizing that complaints about the outer world often stem from one's own internal insecurities, taking an honest look at those emotions, and growing from them"" is what TRP advocates.

&gt;And it doesn't take a genius for a sub to deny its biggest criticisms in its introduction. Despite that introduction, blaming feminism seems quite common. In fact, control-f just this comments page.

TRP describes ""The Five Stages of Red Pill""

- Denial: ""Women aren't like that! They're people just like everyone else! Treat them all as individuals, and you're sure to find the right one!""

- Anger: ""WTF! Bitches are all like this! They have no honour, no loyalty, and they don't really love anyone but themselves! Fucking cunts!""

- Bargaining: ""If I work real hard and learn all the pickup moves, then at least I'll get laid.""

- Depression: ""Getting laid by shallow, obnoxious women has become dull and unrewarding. And there's no sense looking for a unicorn. Maybe I'll just be MGTOW for a while.""

- Acceptance: ""Women aren't bad. My expectations of them, and theirs of me, were based on faulty premises. They are creatures of instinct, just like I am... but of different instincts. If I learn what those instincts are, and teach them about mine, we can develop realistic expectations of each other and get along just fine.""

By simply cherry-picking comments from people still stuck in the ""Anger"" phase, you are misrepresenting TRP.  I would argue that TRP is a transient stage, and most of those who finally ""get it"" no longer frequent the sub.

"d1g2c33","I'm from Thane (aka almost Mumbai), MH.

We have water cuts 1-2 days a week. Usually Wednesday/Thursdays. My housing society is spending boatloads on ordering tankers because apparently people  just don't get the message even after multiple reminders to save water and store up on the previous day. There have been cases of members actually throwing a fit with the manager because water was cut off for a few hours. Other things that tick me off are people watering their plants for 20 minutes, and those fancy car washes with the high pressure hoses. A bucket of water is sufficient to wipe down your car, for heaven's sake!

People are unaware and inconsiderate. There is no effort to behave like we are in a drought. A few hours away from Mumbai, people get water once a week, and have to lock their drums so that theives can't get their stores. Meanwhile dipshits are playing holi here. This is surreal and straight out of a socialist nightmare book. 

I have not seen this problem (and a huge one at that) being reported widely. ToI gave it some coverage in November, Indian express does like a piece a week. Marathi papers do cover the drought in interior Maharashtra frequently.

Lack of rainfall in past 2 years, increasing food prices, peak oil, increased focus of society on buying unnecessary shit, and 'I'll take of myself, everyone else can fuck themselves' attitudes are done problems that deeply trouble me and many of you'll too, I guess. 

A few years ago I started to commit to a very low impact lifestyle, because I don't fancy the guilt of adding to environmental destruction. Small things can have a snowball effect, like avoiding geyser and AC use as much as possible, walking and using public transport only (not as bad as it sounds), avoiding malls/pubs in favour of hills and gardens, fewer clothes and shoes, buying only essential groceries (try avoiding snacks for a week or two, you'll feel better), treating plastic like the plague, and generally being aware of the consequences my choices will have. Might be insignificant, but it gives you peace of mind.

If anyone has suggestions on how to raise awareness/save water on a personal level, I'd love to hear it. I was thinking of raising a proposal to start metering each house for separate billing but I'm 100% sure it would be shot down.

"d0yq6l1","Saying Alexis has been awful is incredibly unfair.

Please watch minute 89 onwards in the Watford game.

He drops deep, drawing 2 Watford defenders, plays a nice one touch pass to Ozil in space, immediately drives past the defenders he has drawn out, which gives him an acre of space. Ozil plays the ball back and Alexis then plays a brilliant through ball to Ozil.

Is this what you mean by him ""destroying out fluidity""?

Many times during other games he makes similar brilliant plays to drag the opposition around, create space for his teammates, and get himself involved in the build-up play (unlike Walcott, for example).

Half the time the problem is that his teammates are too unaware and too slow to take advantage of his ability to open up space for others.

A lot of times during games he beats multiple opposing defenders with his dribbling only for there to be no one taking advantage of that by making runs behind the defenders he draws, which forces him to take useless long shots.

Too often it's his teammates that destroy our fluidity and blunt our attacks. Again, please watch that same play from the Watford game.

Ozil plays the ball back to Alexis. Walcott and Iwobi stand like idiots in a straight line, blocking his shot and allowing the defenders to congest the shooting lane. One of them should have IMMEDIATELLY dropped wide to give him a passing option and to draw the defender out of the shooting lane while the other should have moved in to drag the other defender out of the shooting lane.

"d0xgxy1","The larger continent, on the right side of the map is called Athrathema. North of the large burgundy nation is North Athrathema and below it is South Athrathema. The large burgundy nation is Vethira. The eight nations, pink, brown, gray, green, orange, blue neon green, and dark gray, are separatist nations, recently broken from the Vethirian Empire. The Vethrian's at one point or another throughout history, have controlled most of the continent. They are the leaders in technology, especially military tech. After a long and bloody war for independence, the Kand'enelian Confederacy, the eight splinter nations, was granted sovereignty. They form together for protection only. Most of the new countries have had long time cultural and border friction. The Vethirians only granted them independence so they would not be fighting a war on both fronts. The Tal'harid, the brownish country to the south west, declared war when Vethira was at its weakest. Curretnly they are slugging it out on the foothills of the Andurian Mountains. The Vethirians are ruled by a hereditary monarchy. They are a highly expansionist and imperialist nation. The western continent was discovered 400 years before. Not much is left to discover there, having been the focus of most of the civilized nations colonial efforts. Vethira has a modest holding in terms of land, but the wealth they gain from it is more than any other nation combines. They currently have the only supply of the basic ingredients for gun powder. It is a relatively new technology, but the Vethirians are researching heavily into its uses.

The neon green nation is called the United Princedoms of Athrathema. Until 200 years ago, the country had been nothing but a bunch of warring and rival princedoms. The individual princes never had enough land or holdings to claim kingship. They finally were united when two princes, who were raised together, became heads of their respective houses. They stood back to back and won several short conflicts against a few other keys princedoms. When they had a sizable land holding and the sworn fealty of a few princes they launched in earnest to conquer the remaining independent countries. The ensuing war was not short, by any means. They were both old men by the time a unified government was founded. The UPA is ruled by an elected Emperor. The current princes form the electing body. A ruler is only allowed to rule for 5 years before an election is held and once he has a term, a prince cannot sit on the throne again for 15 years. Rarely has a prince had a second term. There are 17 princedoms in the UPA. The princes appoint a law making body. The appointments are voted on and are for life (the life of the prince, that is. When he dies, the new prince makes his appointments). There are 3 law makers for every prince, making the total 51. They have been a fractured and insular nation for so long, that a foray into world politics has gone poorly for them. They quickly found themselves on the losing end of a few deals that were forced on them by the Vethirians. There economy is on the mend, due in large part to the fact that they were able to consolidate their colonial holdings as well. The princes had very little territory but had stuck close to one another in case the natives had attacked. Now, after 200 years of consolidation and tentative cooperation in the Council of Princes, they hold the majority of the richest farming land on the west continent. They make a modest prophet, what they can keep Vethira from taking, from exotic food imports. They are also the main focus of the light blue country's (on the west continent) interest. They are the natives. 

Technologically behind the rest of the world has not stopped them from being a force to be reckoned with. They are know across Athrathema as the Ululuthians. The name comes from the sound of their language. It is very undulating and rhythmically created. They might not have gun powder or many seafaring ships, but they make up for it in pure ferocity. At first, the Athrathemians found a bunch of tribes killing each other and fighting on a seasonal basis. They would only war against each other in the winter, when the conditions were harshest. They had permanent settlements but did not have the means for larger cities. When the Athrathemians first showed up, they tried to settle peacefully and establish a relationship with the Ululthians. The first winter was devastating for the settlers. They were caught unaware and mostly unprepared. In just a few short months, the Ululuthians had put aside their differences and unified in a way that almost made the memory of different clans or tribes disappear. They fought and slaughtered en mass. Just a short two years later, the ships of the major Athrathemians showed back up. This time there were no settlers. Just soldiers. The settlers came a couple years later when the poorly outfitted natives had lost much territory. Again the Athrathemians found a unified and cooperative group of ferocious natives. They numbered in the millions, it was estimated, spread out over the continent. Now, 400 years later, they control the largest portion of land and are mainly left alone. Their land has been deemed unworthy of the lives it would take to conquer it by every single colonial nation. That doesn't stop them from attacking their neighbors. Only in winter, predictably. Unbeknownst to the Athrathemians, the Ululuthians have been getting weapons and training from a foreign nation. They are massing for a push to get their land back.

The red nation on the island is the most diverse of all the nations and the only truly republic nation in the world. They are known as Keth. They are ruled by an elected Minister of Trade. As you can probably imagine, they have been a seafaring nation for many, many years. They were the first nation to discover the western continent, nearly 300 years before the Athrathemians. They do not in any way shape or form consider themselves to be Athrathemians. They are the least militaristic nation among the modern nations. They, however, have the strongest merchant fleet and navy. For many years they had been trading with the Ululuthians, taking their exotic raw materials and goods to Athrathema. They trade indiscriminately with all countries. It doesn't matter a government's political policy, gold is still gold. There is not a single Easternized nation that does not have a Kethian Guild in it. Keth is the language of trade. Every merchant that trades outside his own borders knows the language. They have caused more wars, however, than any other nation. From almost the beginnings of their modern society, they have not had nobles or a king. The Keth have always elected their leaders. They didn't have upper class and lower class struggles as a fledgling nation. They put their people to work on farms, clearing roads, or mostly building ships and sailing. Their people were fed and clothed when they worked and taken care of when they couldn't. The guilds formed to protect the interest of the different trades and jobs. They evolved into the foundation of Keth society. The guilds are both a protection for the traders and workers and the administration. The guild leaders are elected internally. The guild is also the political parties. The bigger the guild, the more votes and, therefore, more seats in the law making body. It works for the Keth people because they generally work for one goal, more gold. In mixing with the Eastern nations, they introduced a new class to the monarchy system of Noble and Serf. The Merchant class threw most of the old systems into chaos for a few years. Power struggles ensued when the Merchants had more power and wealth than the ruling class did. Some nations tried to outlaw the Merchants, but quickly found themselves without the Keth traders and the raw materials they could not get elsewhere. Since the discovery of the Western continent, the Keth's power has declines. They are no longer the only nations to exploit the raw material rich continent. They have spent most of their time losing wars and territory to the Vethirians. They have turned to more nefarious means of making money. Pirating.

"d0mi407","tl;dr - too long, don't read - I'm mostly posting this for myself

I have a fairly crippling fear of bumming people out with my life.  I've had a lot go on in my life, and it seems like every day I'm having to fight depression off more and more.  I know I should reach out or get help, and I have in the past.  For a while.  But I feel like a broken record, and I start to feel bad about not having anything better to say about myself.  I'm in the worst place I've ever been in my life, and I feel so guilty for saying or thinking it because I still have it better than a lot of other people.  People come to me with their problems all the time, and they apologize for bringing it up for the umpteenth time when their problem is relatively so small compared to the rest of the world, and I tell them that it's okay ... talk about it.  Everyone's problems are their own, and what seems like a molehill to some is an Everest-sized mountain for others, and you never know where you might find insight or a perspective that will show you an easier path, or sturdier path, or any path at all really.

I tell them that, and I mean it, but I can't bring myself to follow my own advice.  I'm almost 40 and I don't have any friends that I can call up and talk to or take comfort from.  I couldn't tell you the last time I've ""hung out"".  I have a wife, but for the past two years, it's only been on paper.  I've been sleeping on the couch for the past two years ... it's lumpy, now, and barely supportive, and it's about 6 inches too short, and just barely wide enough to contain my shoulder width.  Doesn't matter.  I don't get much sleep anyway.  I didn't want the separation, I didn't want to be just this side of divorce ... I tried everything I could to make her happy.  She's even said that I've been the perfect husband for her and that getting married was *her* mistake because she knew deep down she never really wanted to get married.  Not to me specifically, just in general.  She was in love with me and felt it was the right thing to do at the time, but now she's unhappy, and there's not really anything I did to cause it, or anything I can do to change it.  But we're stuck together because financially, she can't afford to move on her own, and I can't afford to provide for her, which I would have to do because with my work schedule, she'd have main custody of our daughter.

So I wake up and go to sleep every day with the reminder that no matter how hard I tried ... and I did everything she asked of me or even mentioned she would like ... I still managed to fail at it.  And I'm not even really mad at her about it.  I can't force her to want me, and if she's made up her mind, then that is that.  But I have to stare at that failure every day because now I live in the living room, and she still hangs out there because it's just a two bedroom apartment.  And since we both know each other inside and out, and have years of sharing between us, she's all I have to talk to, really, but I can't bring up this constant tsunami of depression trying to drown me because she happens to be one of the catalysts.  And I don't want to start anything in front of my daughter, anyway.  I come from two broken homes, and it's the last thing I ever want to put her through.  She's all I have left at this point.  I know eventually we'll have to break her heart, and that day will crush me, but for now she's still happy and unaware, and I want her to enjoy that for as long as possible.

Work is overwhelming me.  I'm relied upon to handle duties that three people should be doing, but there's no hope of that because most people with my skill set have a college diploma behind it that offers them the opportunity for better pay.  My job is a mountain that has been growing faster than it is physically impossible for one person to climb.  The one spark of light in all of this is that my boss knows what he's putting me through and rather than riding my ass all the time, he accommodates anything I may need and keeps other people off of my back as long as I keep things at least somewhat current.  But again, it all comes in faster than I can handle on my own, so on top of 70 hour work weeks, I usually bring  work home to do in my spare time.  Not like I was doing anything else, anyway.

I know it's getting bad for me.  I'm numb or angry most of the time, but I have to hide it.  I find myself fighting off tears that start welling up without warning.  I can't be seen breaking down because too many people rely on me.  I keep half-joking with people at work that they should be working as hard as possible to at least get close to my level, because when that aneurysm or stroke that I've been hoping for finally takes me out, they're going to have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to do my job.  And it might sound egotistical, but I don't really have an ego at this point.  I just see a potential for problems down the line because they really are screwed if I can't show up for whatever reason.  I can't tell them what it's doing to me.  I'm a supervisor, and a 16-year vet at my job.  More often than not, I'm the only one they can come to for advice or guidance, and I can't tell them to fuck off because I'm feeling emotional.

And I can't let civilians see me crack.  I'm busting my ass to try to be a good example of what a cop can be.  Civil.  Helpful.  Firm but fair.  Not an asshole or some bully with inferiority issues.  Not a jack-booted thug with loyalties only to ""the man.""  In 16 years, I've only had to draw down four times, and I'm happy about that.  But, I'm a big white cop in the south, in a poor black city.  My only place of refuge is the internet, and they automatically hate me (save for select groups of people with whom I'd rather not associate).  A lot of days I have to stay off of social media when some undertrained idiot with a badge goes OK Corral on a kid with a slingshot.  I can't defend or decry their actions, so I'm just left watching as people condemn all cops or all black kids with slingshots.  It's exhausting, and it only adds to all of the pressure I'm under.

But I can't bring myself to reach out or accept help.  It makes me feel worse because in the long run, I know there are people out there who have actual, capital-B Bad lives.  Yes, my situations suck, but I'm fully and firmly employed, and I have a roof over my head and food to eat.  My daughter adores me, and as soon-to-be ex-wives go, at least we're not at each other's throats.  Everything is pretty civil, and most of the time, even friendly.  She was my best friend before she was my wife, so it's not like we're back to being strangers.  And now that I'm not constantly trying to save a sinking ship, I can stand up for myself against her a lot easier because, fuck it, it's not like she can make my life any worse without bringing herself down.

I cut off all other ties, though.  People I used to talk to online, I haven't spoken to in months.  I have a couple of social media accounts, but I don't post anything personal.  Just jokes and nonsense because I'm a ""funny guy"", and I'm too embarrassed to even begin to try to bring all of this up to people who know me, or rather, are online acquaintances.  That's all I have, now.  The only way I was posting this wall of text was through a throwaway because I didn't want it associated with my ""fun"" account.  It'll take everything I have to hit the ""save"" button for it rather than delete it.

I feel like such a hypocrite because I keep telling people to keep hope alive and look for the positives while my life is so shit that I can't follow my own advice.  And people will say ""You have your daughter, though.  At least there's that.  Focus on her.""  How does that help?  Leach onto her and find my happiness through hers?  Why would I put that kind of pressure on her.  And, I'm sorry, but it's not enough.  It might sound shitty, but it isn't, and I'm not much into denial, so faking it isn't going to help.

Anyway, if any of you bothered to read past the first paragraph, then I feel sorry for you.  I didn't expect you to.  I only wrote it for the catharsis, however brief, of airing it out, and the question from OP inspired me to finally do it.

"d0kpheb","Know your lawyers, know your cases.

I work in a PD office in a sizable jurisdiction, and we have a large pool of attorneys and investigators.

Just as each investigator has a different set of skills and experience, each attorney has a different set of desires and expectations. Some attorneys want total control over the investigation - develop a plan, check in along the way, etc, etc. Some want to throw you a copy of the discovery and say ""get stuff, let me know."" Others fall in the middle. Some lawyers will lean on you for advice - ""what did you think of so-and-so, did he come off as credible, flaky, trainspotty, vindictive..?"" Others still may tell you to mind your own business when you offer an opinion, because they're assholes. 

Some of us pick and choose our investigator based on what we perceive the investigators' strengths to be and how we expect the investigation to play out, but many attorneys just leave it up to the department lead to assign the case out, and I'm pretty sure the lead just doles them out in a ""who's up next"" fashion, which can be a problem. Some cases require some real bulldogging, going out after hard to find witnesses and tracking them down no matter what because they are the key to some exculpatory fact, or have impeachment information, etc. However, other cases (especially things like stale domestic assault cases) require a lighter touch - you want to find out who the state's going to be able to bring in, but you don't want to find someone the state *won't* find on their own, thereby alerting that witness to the case when they otherwise would have been blissfully unaware, and unavailable to testify against the client. Notes and recorded interviews *can* be a good thing. For example, if your ""victim"" in an assault is suddenly recanting hard, a recorded interview sent over to the state in advance of trial can be extraordinary leverage, and even lead to dismissal. One of my favorite investigators for domestic cases has this ability to get people to do a ""soft interview"" over the phone while setting up an in-person interview, so she pretty well knows going in if she should do a recorded/heavily noted interview, or just talk with the person. 

Find a way to see a trial. Pick something like a simple assault, and watch beginning to end, and then take the attorney out for a drink and pick her/his brain. A case like that should take maybe 2 days to see beginning to end, including verdict. Know what the attorney and client go through in the courtroom, and be there when a defendant and his counsel stand up and hear the verdict. Take notes along he way so you know what you want to ask about over a drink. This will help you contextualize the endgame, so you know how you fit in to the opening and middle game. 

We joke about the ""dark side"" around our office too, but never buy into that. When the wrath of the State is brought to bear against an individual, that individual turns to us. It's an arranged marriage, they don't get to choose who their appointed attorney is, but that attorney holds the client's life in their hand. Every conviction, no matter how seemingly insignificant, is the taking of a life one day at a time.  That attorney is turning to you, and depending on you to help save a life. Never forget that if the State does their job correctly, there's nothing we can do to prevent conviction. No matter how sure you are a client ""did it,"" it's the State's job to prove it, and to bring it legit - no conviction is worth the erosion of the rights and protections we all depend on. Prosecutors love to introduce themselves at trial as ""I'm Lawyer Joe, and I represent the State."" A particularly arrogant (but effective) friend of mine likes to respond, ""I am Lawyer Jack, and I represent the State one person at a time.""

As far as defaults, I'd say when in doubt:

- Ask your attorney.
- Assume nothing.
- Expect emergencies.
- Always question the official narrative.
- No emails or voicemails more substantive than ""need to talk (ASAP/by Wed/this week/etc),"" so your lawyer can prioritize the call appropriately, but nothing is disclosed. 
- Immediately inform the attorney if it appears the State is interfering with the interview. In every jurisdiction I'm aware of, this is sanctionable action.
- I ask all my investigators to track contact attempts, because it can really save skins late in the game. Names and rules for the last hearing before trial vary by jurisdiction, but I've managed to pull some interesting shit because I've been able to put my investigator on speakerphone who then lists off all the attempts to contact the witness by phone, mail, and in person, which then resulted in the judge looking at the prosecutor and asking ""do you really expect this witness to show or did you just put them on the list because they're in the police report? Have you ever spoken to this person? You have until the end of the week to get them in here or we're talking mismanagement sanctions and a dismissal!"" It also may save your skin, too.
- No case is worth your reputation.
- You have an absolute obligation to the client. To that end, while you have an obligation to be truthful, you have no obligation to ""the Truth."" This may seem like a cop-out, but once you start questioning the official narrative, you'll see that frequently the State is no more concerned with ""the Truth"" or ""Justice"" than your average revenge fiend.

Above all, enjoy the work. I think public defense is some of the most fun you can have with your pants on.

"d0b0s5f","That's cute.  

I'm not sure why you find it so strange that the pro gun folks have a deep mistrust of the ""pro reg"" as you like to call them.  

First of all, do you really expect us to believe that people who have dedicated themselves to gun control as a cause *really* do not want to ""take all the guns away even if they could""?  

The people who dedicate their time towards gun control, which clearly implies they believe it's extremely important, if not THE most important cause of our time, would have no interest in an outright ban on civilian ownership of firearms if it were tantalizing within reach. The people who do not own guns, have no interest in owning them and frequently make it quite clear that they believe most gun owners are dangerous and mentally unsound (unless they fit their accepted stereotype Fudd type who owns a ""deer rifle"" and/or acceptable gentleman's shotgun.  

We are to believe that they have no interest in anything more than an organized system or national background checks. Once they've achieved that, they will pursue no further gun control legislation on the state or national level. They will never propose a national registry to give the background check system a mechanism for enforcement. They will never attempt to pass anything like an ""assault weapons ban"". If they did happen to pass some sort of ban like that, they would NEVER use said registry to identify individuals in possession of the weapons subject to ban and then pursue whatever methods they thought they could get away with to coerce those people into surrendering or turning those weapons it or at minimum forbid them to either sell them or leave them to their descendants in a will.  

All of those things may fall short of ""taking our guns away"" in your mind, but to us, they are abhorent and much too close to ""confiscation"" for comfort. It's only a few more steps from there to aggressively enforcing bans and using all possible leverage to harrass people into relinquishing non-compliant weapons.  

It's not an A to B scenario. We get that. Accepting UBC as law does not equal ""they are taking ur gunz away"". But, just like every other piece of gun control legislation, it brings us a step closer.  

You yourself have claimed you don't believe we have any right to anything more than a handgun that holds 10 rounds that remains in the the home for self defense. I can tell you that I have a bit more than that. If laws are passed which make other guns I own illegal, forbid me to sell them, make parts and accessories to keep them operating difficult or impossible to get and finally require them to be surrendered to the state upon my death, rather than left to someone in my will, that's close enough to a de facto confiscation for me.  

If you ban the most popular rifle in America, that's ""taking our guns away"". I supposed when gun control folks say they ""don't want to take our guns away"", what they mean to say is, they don't intend to  deploy LE and military door-to-door to confiscate them by force. That's a wise choice, though that was never on the table to begin with and we all know it.  

All of the resistance and pushback you get against your ""common sense"" gun laws, like UBC, comes from those of us who are students of history. You may very well believe that you're really going to apply UBC and stop there. No semi-auto rifle bans. Nothing else but UBC...and a registry perhaps. Somehow I doubt any of you honestly want only that and nothing more, but even if you did, history has show us that regulation and restrictions lead to more of the same. The only reason gun control activists and politicians ever back off temporarily or soften their rhetoric (now you're about ""gun safety"" instead of ""gun control"" uh huh. Very clever...) is because you're trying to calm the rage of the gun rights crowd and hopefully turn attention away from the laws you're pushing though in every state and city you can get them in.  

So feel free to characterize us all as ""Chicken Littles"" crying about the sky falling if you wish. You aren't fooling anyone. We all know the gun *control* faction will take gun control as far as they believe they can. They will voluntarily slow their ""progress"" or conceal their goals when they believe it will give them a tactical advantage, but they have no interest in settling or stopping at a certain point. Most of them likely know and may even accept they are unlikely to ever get to anything like an outright ban, or even European or Australian levels of totalitarian gun control, but they will push and push and take whatever they can get. Do you deny this? I can tell you that most of us are quite aware of it. Call us paranoid if you wish, but I'd rather associate with people paranoid about losing their rights than those who are blissfully unaware and complacent.

"d08cwvy","There is a difference between being stable in life and healthy mentally and emotionally. You got red flags all over this post that indicate that if a good man met you he would walk away. Especially at 30. Healthy people don't have time or energy for that shit.

&gt;  I dated someone seriously for 6 months but he was too needy and he hated me for not being as needy. Being a late bloomer didn't help as I didn't know how to express my feelings except through sex (and to me it was fun and a totally exciting new thing). But he saw that as me just being a nympho and non relationship-material.

There are several red flags there.

1. Not taking personal responsibility for your failure in past relationships.
2. Sexually/emotionally unaware and unhealthy practices that scream issues
3. Blaming things outside of your control for your issues instead of taking agency over ones of personal responsibility to make oneself happy

After that it's red flag after red flag.

I'd see a therapist and learn a sense of personal responsibility.

"d058t3h","its honestly quite tremendous. I've always heard about long waiting times being a thing (from American commentators) and the longest I've ever had to wait to see a doctor was 48 hours, and that's because the ones they offered I couldn't do. And these are in a number of areas, with different doctors + surgeries.

As for surgeries, the NHS saved my life when I was born, had my trachea + food tube fused together when I was born, so was fed and started to choke. Had a operation right there and then to cut it up, had a long stay in hospital, didn't cost my parents anything and I was all fixed up, and have had nothing but solid support since then if any issues arose. 

Since then I've used the NHS lots for a load of things, but the only cost is buying tablets and things from pharmacies, which is about 8 pounds/15 dollars or so per prescription, and doctors will always try and double up and say you need more than you should per prescription when its a repeat. My antacid meds the doctor said he'd put a triple order in, so I get a load for 8 pounds instead of shelling out that for one pack I get 3.

"czw0t80","&gt; if not burdened by the needs of his expensive, status-hungry wife. Probably a much more fun and adventurous one doing stuff rather than chained to desk earning money to sustain the lifestyle of his no doubt ungrateful wife.

I actually did just a little (trivial) amount of ""digging"" on the woman, and [from her ""professional bio"" on her own company website (archive.is copy)](http://archive.is/5Kh1f) comes this little tidbit:

&gt;&gt;In another life, **Julie was the owner of an award-winning events business,** until a debilitating divorce and a series of life changing events resulted in business loss and bankruptcy.

So that's what she was busy doing while hubby was slaving away; she was running an ""award winning"" (but note that winning awards is not necessarily the same as ""operating profitably"") ""events business"" (aka social-extravaganza).

It's the classic loss-making ""the wife wants something to do &amp; to play at being a 'business-woman' scenario"" -- so hubby subsidizes her operations, even takes on additional debt (in his name or with him as co-signer -- because he's the only one with assets &amp; a reliable income) to fund what in essence is an expensive and pretentious ""hobby"".

Now either she was a wholly incompetent and irresponsible ""business"" person -- entirely UNaware and UNcaring about whether her ""award winning events business"" was operating at a profit or a loss, and whether it was able to carry its own debt or was being capitalized by hubby's labor -- in which case she really WASN'T ""managing"" that ""events"" thing as a ""business""...

OR, she WAS sufficiently involved and competent... and therefore knew damned well the state of their finances; and that she herself was at least partially if not largely or wholly to blame for the massive debt build up.

Those are really the only two choices.

Moreover, while he was doubtless the source of majority of the creditworthiness &amp; income that sustained it... if they were married (and if not then no ""divorce"" would be possible, nor would it cause her problems with continuing to operate HER ""business"", and HIS debt would NOT have become hers), and she was ostensibly the owner/manager of HER side ""business"" -- there is no way that she hadn't ALSO been required to legally ""sign"" any &amp; all major debt-related instruments.

--

Also, even just looking at her pictures, she must now be all of mid-30's, possibly 40 years old -- subtract the time spans she's talking about (the 7 years for the credit to rebuild, the 3 years of the bankruptcy, etc) and it dials her back to being in her mid to late 20's (at the oldest) and was quite probably even younger (i.e. early to mid 20's). 

So little miss ""Rainbow"" was unquestionably ""living the good/high life"" almost *instantly* after marrying Mr Big Bux -- fancy home, fancy car, house probably being taken care of by maid, kids by an ""au pair"" while she was gallivanting around getting to pretend/play at being ""successful business woman"" planning extravaganza ""events"" (like a perpetual bride-to-be) and winning ""awards"", etc.  (And quite probably engaged in all sorts of other little non-professional ""activities"" on the side.)

Oh yeah, she was ALL about the ""status""; still is.

She drained him dry... loaded him up with debt... and then shifted all of the blame onto HIM when he decided to get the hell outta dodge.

She hasn't learned a damned thing (other than the fact that she CAN get away with it... and that people will continue to buy into her bullshit; at least so long as she remains young, fairly attractive &amp; charming).",1455201635,"now either she was a wholly incompetent and irresponsible ""business"" person -- entirely unaware and uncaring about whether her ""award winning events business"" was operating at a profit or a loss, and whether it was able to carry its own debt or was being capitalized by hubby's labor -- in which case she really wasn't ""managing"" that ""events"" thing as a ""business""...","unaware and uncaring","unaware","and",FALSE,"entirely unaware and uncare","uncare","entirely",NA,1

"czkl05r","It sounds like you just described Cooper's colors however your instructor seemed to get it mixed up.

For anyone interested: 

**White**: Unaware and unprepared. If attacked in Condition White, the only thing that may save you is the inadequacy or ineptitude of your attacker. When confronted by something nasty, your reaction will probably be ""Oh my God! This can't be happening to me.""

**Yellow**: Relaxed alert. No specific threat situation. Your mindset is that ""today could be the day I may have to defend myself"". You are simply aware that the world is a potentially unfriendly place and that you are prepared to defend yourself, if necessary. You use your eyes and ears, and realize that ""I may have to shoot today"". You don't have to be armed in this state, but if you are armed you should be in Condition Yellow. You should always be in Yellow whenever you are in unfamiliar surroundings or among people you don't know. You can remain in Yellow for long periods, as long as you are able to ""Watch your six."" (In aviation 12 o'clock refers to the direction in front of the aircraft's nose. Six o'clock is the blind spot behind the pilot.) In Yellow, you are ""taking in"" surrounding information in a relaxed but alert manner, like a continuous 360 degree radar sweep. As Cooper put it, ""I might have to shoot.""

**Orange**: Specific alert. Something is not quite right and has your attention. Your radar has picked up a specific alert. You shift your primary focus to determine if there is a threat (but you do not drop your six). Your mindset shifts to ""I may have to shoot that person today"", focusing on the specific target which has caused the escalation in alert status. In Condition Orange, you set a mental trigger: ""If that person does ""X"", I will need to stop them"". Your pistol usually remains holstered in this state. Staying in Orange can be a bit of a mental strain, but you can stay in it for as long as you need to. If the threat proves to be nothing, you shift back to Condition Yellow.

**Red**: Condition Red is fight. Your mental trigger (established back in Condition Orange) has been tripped. ""If 'X' happens I will shoot that person"" — 'X' has happened, the fight is on.

&gt; Rockstor Web-UI and Data Loss Monitoring
Currently, there is no support for monitoring of drives or pools in Rockstor. So the web-ui is simply unaware and incapable of notifying potential problems or failures. It is a high priority for us to improve this aspect of Rockstor and we are working on it.
At the moment, we suggest that you have your own scripts and methods to detect any potential failures.
Rockstor also does not support any recovery features at this time. Given the current state of rapid BTRFS development, we have not added this support as it may need to fundamentally change again. So wear your Linux ninja hat to troubleshoot serious data loss problems.

"cz4usqy","I am in no way experienced in social engineering by any means but I believe the first two steps would be:

•1. To mandate Native American studies in the early years in order to influence a contagion of apathy and understanding into the barbaric means the native peoples were terrorized with. I put this 1st because too many people seem unaware and unconcerned with the social problems Native Americans face. 

•2. All treaties and agreements be honored with priority and a focused and honest determination to complete agreements with any ongoing land disputes. 

The Native people have to experience an acceptance that is trustworthy and lasting. A willingness to believe in them and a show of desire to learn some of their knowledge.   

I've grown up living right next to a reserve and my life has always been integrated with native people. I can say as a witness there is an abundance of racism and separatism that exists, by pure ignorance, in the minds of many. But not all, and that gives great hope. There are beautiful people and evil people in all races. I don't understand why that is so difficult for some people to grasp.

"cz4aci3","I've been bopping around a bit, 9/11, Oklahoma City Bombings, San Bernardino, the Occult influence on Masons, Jesuits, Qabbalah, MK-Ultra, UFOs, Yitzhak Rabin, CIA funding ISIS... The picture that slowly emerges from all of this is honestly frightening. They are going to tear the world apart to get what they want. Order out of chaos...

I've got two young kids and am scared thinking about the world they are going to be living in. I am trying to not let it get to me, because I know that they want to rule us through fear. But it's hard.

I really am starting to feel like I took the red pill. I walk around and can't figure out how everyone around me can be so unaware and complacent. How I could have been like that until recently.

"cz11ss6","At least two of these recomendations should catch your eye. 

**Anime:** {Kotoura-san}. Character: *[Haruka Kotoura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san)*. Abnormality: She's a true mind reader in a setting so realistically close to our present time, its science is literally unaware and unassuming that psychic powers actually do exist despite and due to their extreme rarity. 

* [My analysis of the show](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3cah9r/are_you_looking_for_a_slice_of_life_that_can_take/) notes more highlights to think about as you watch because everything does make logical sense or is otherwise understandable. This narrative is simply a master of ""showing and not telling"", and it's very fair about the details it reveals in accordance to their respective climaxes and resolutions.

**Anime:** {Scrapped Princess}. Character: *[Pacifica Casull](http://myanimelist.net/character/275/Pacifica_Casull)*, the titular princess. Abnormality: She's prophesied to be ""the poison that will destroy the world"" on her 16th birthday. She also should have died as a newborn but she ""miraculously"" survived (thanks to the Casull family who adopted her afterwards). 

* This one is much more action driven compared to the others, and it has a very unique twist on medieval fantasy in general.

**Anime:** {Gingitsune}. Characters: *[Makoto Saeki](http://myanimelist.net/character/82709/Makoto_Saeki)* and later *[Satoru Kamio](http://myanimelist.net/character/88429/Satoru_Kamio)*. Abnormality: Since they are the last true heirs of their respective shrine-keeping families, they have the ability to perceive and interact with supernatural beings known as heralds, spirits of dead animals who inhabit said family's shines ever since they became direct servants to the gods that the shrines were made for.

* While this show is Slice of Life and Urban Fantasy, it's more the former than it is the latter. It's a very unique and creative experience for said genres nonetheless, and it has one of the most beautiful settings that I know of.

**Anime:** {Castle Town Dandelion}. Character: *the entire Sakurada family* (except the mother). Abnormality: Each of said family members (*nine siblings* among them) has their own unique superpower because of their royal bloodline. 

* There is an interesting corollary at work here. They are not living in the castle but rather in a modest middle class suburb because the king is uncomfortable with upper class life in general. He also did this because he wanted his nine children to grow up with ordinary lifestyles among the common folk despite their abnormal qualities and ties to monarchy.",1452995940,"abnormality: she's a true mind reader in a setting so realistically close to our present time, its science is literally unaware and unassuming that psychic powers actually do exist despite and due to their extreme rarity.","unaware and unassuming","unaware","and",FALSE,"literally unaware and unassuming","unassuming","literally",NA,1

"cytqvz8","&gt; That said, unaware and uninformed are the only part of the definition that makes sense to be used here and what she said clearly does make sense. That is, if one is to protect ones liberty they had best know who supports that liberty and who does not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Being uninformed is the primary problem that must be addressed first.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The psychological aspects of the word ""complacent"" with regard to achievement are irrelevant to the effort. But the awareness, concern, and thinking aspects are very important.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course there must be a better word to use and I won't bother to criticize Merriam Webster for misidentifying a most important meaning of the word. BE THAT as it may the word ""complacent"" is used and has been used with regard lack of awareness and lack of concern of gun rights from as early as the 1621.

You just pulled a ""you didn't build that.""  

The rest of that sentence is the important part. Try reading it.    

&gt;http://www.constitution.org/mil/maltrad.htm

&gt;This meaning says zilch about any psychological sense of undue over-satisfaction from achievement. It says exactly that the public aren't aware of any problem and aren't concerned.

&gt;Maybe the word complacent has changed meaning in 400 years. But the concern has not.

&gt;So Yes. I read first definition the Merriam Webster definition and found it even less suitable than the second and unnecessarily internal and complicated in comparison to how it has been used in regard to defending one's liberty. Maybe their dictionary ought to update. Barry Goldwater understood the problem.

&gt;Footnote: The Oxford Dictionary of American English does emphasize thinking and concern aspects of complacency.   

You're not disagreeing with what I said there, if you actually read what I said.
