"hqp8h33","&gt; that's the whole point of being anti-natalist?

Oh, honey no- The whole point is not wanting people to suffer. Hatred does not come into it. What a sad perspective.

We don't hate natalists; we feel sorry for them because they have been brainwashed, are slaves to animalistic instincts, and don't know any better. Is what they're doing wrong? Obviously. Does that make them bad people? Obviously not. 

&gt;You act like trans men can't get pregnant or have abortions too, you moron. Criticizing a natalist who happens to be a woman doesn't make me a misogynist. Ever heard the term ""birthing people""? For a trans person you sound pretty trans-phobic.

Oh, piss off- I'm a transman; I'm fully aware of that, but given the context of female reproductivity and the subject being a woman, I went with misogynist. Hateful, intolerant, and ignorant of female reproductive rights, especially when combined with social status as a woman, describes you just as well so let's go with that instead. 

Also, the reason that transmen also struggle with getting abortions etc. is because when it comes to healthcare related to our sexes, people will more often than not see us and therefore treat us as women. Just because we're not, doesn't mean that we aren't subject to misogynistic attitudes just the same as women. Everyone has to recognise us as men for us to be exempt from being subject to misogyny and unfortunately, many people don't, especially in the context of female reproductive health. 

&gt;Do you really think the woman is that immature 

People in coercive/ abusive relationships are immature, TIL. I'm not saying it was the case here, but with the information we have it's just as possible as your conclusion. 

&gt;you're just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, most people out there are natalists, the chances of her being forced into late pregnancy are way too slim to even suggest. She most likely intended to have kids.

1) Yes, of course I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Innocent until proven guilty, no? Must be hard to always see the worst in everyone and always be so cynical

2) You are highly ignorant of the way that social pressures affect our actions. If the entire world is expecting you to have a baby including your friends and family, I can't blame you for caving to that sort of pressure, even though it's the wrong thing to do. People are not perfect and many people haven't had the privilege of learning about antinatalism the way that we have. Many people are indoctrinated from a young age to be religious; it's not easy to undo all of that and abstain from having kids, especially not if you don't understand why it's a bad thing to have them. 

&gt;Its a matter of life and death, hence why i used the word killing coz I didn't know what better words to use to describe the situation at that moment, like what the actual fuck is wrong with you? You're dragging things way out of context

Um, letting someone die, like I've told you about three times now. 

&gt;Dude, the internet is clearly not for you, jfc https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/grammar-nazi/

"hqm2uig","Well, as /u/y_sengaku has already already pointed out, the veracity of the so-called *Laudabiliter* is very much under question. If it isn‚Äôt an outright forgery then it seems probable that the version which survives was heavily doctored, perhaps owing more to Gerald of Wales than to Pope Adrian IV. However, leaving aside the historicity of the bull itself, there is no doubt that it played an important role in legitimising English imperialism in Ireland.

The *Laudabiliter* was accepted as a legitimate papal grant, even by those who had reason to reject it‚Äôs authority (ie. the native Irish). Likewise, other contemporary papal documents express similar viewpoints to those of the *Laudabiliter*. For instance in 1172, following the English invasion Pope Alexander III had praised King Henry II for having:

&gt; ‚Äúsubjected to his dominion that people, a barbarous one, one uncivilized and ignorant of the Divine law‚Äù

Ireland was:

&gt; ‚Äúa kingdom which the Roman emperors, the conquerors of the world, left untouched in their time‚Äù 

And Henry‚Äôs subjugation of that kingdom was portrayed by Pope Alexander as a kind of penance which would win him an eternal crown (Henry had just recently been responsible - directly or indirectly - for the death of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury). 

In addition, the majority of Ireland‚Äôs many petty-kings actually acquiesced to the overlordship of the English King (this [portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/r7nsj7/comment/hn1r927/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) of the main answer dealing with English colonialism in Ireland also might be of interest). This recognition of overlordship should also be seen in the context of the Irish High-kingship, but there was probably a religious component to this as well. Shortly after this submission Pope Alexander III wrote to the Irish Church and to these Irish Kings, praising them for accepting Henry as their ‚Äúking and lord‚Äù. Though of course not all the Irish kings did accept Henry as such, and there would continue to be significant opposition in the centuries that followed. 

To be a bit more specific, I‚Äôll take your three questions in turn‚Ä¶

**Was it particularly important for the Anglo-Normans to have Papal backing when they invaded Ireland?**

As with many aspects of English imperialist ideologies towards Ireland these can be traced back largely to the works of Gerald of Wales. In his work *Expugnatio Hibernica* (the *Conquest of Ireland*) from 1189 Gerald makes reference to a ‚Äúpapal bull of privileges‚Äù granted by Pope Adrian; as noted the Laudabiliter itself is only extant in the copy included within Gerald‚Äôs text. However, this is not the only justification for English conquest in Ireland. 

Gerald makes reference to England‚Äôs ‚Äòfivefold right‚Äô to Ireland. The first of these was rooted in the Arthurian legends of early medieval Britain, in which the Irish King Gilomarius was supposed to have recognised King Arthur as his liege (an invention of Gerald). However, even this was a re-affirmation of an existing right. In ancient times the original Irish settlers had apparently been granted the land by the British King Gurguntius. 

In addition, those original settlers were said to have come from Spain and, in particular, the Basque Country. Since the Irish were descended from the Basques, whose modern capital - Bayonne - lay within King Henry‚Äôs II dominions in Gascony, it seemed self-evident to Gerald that they should recognise his authority elsewhere too. Aside from all this there was also a *jus irrefragabile* (irrefutable right) based on the ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô submission of the Irish kings to Henry II. 

The fifth and final of these claims is that provided by the papal grant itself, which Gerald claims ‚Äòis enough to complete the title and give it absolute confirmation‚Äô. Thus we can see that the Laudabiliter was an important aspect of the claim, but at least in Gerald‚Äôs account the English invasion of Ireland does not rest solely on it. It is presented as more of a ‚Äòcherry on top‚Äô as it were. 

Claims like these continued to have an important role within English ideology even up to the early modern period, with several commentators merely rehearsing Gerald‚Äôs arguments without much regard for their accuracy. As Andrew Hadfield has noted, even ‚Äòhighly sceptical Tudor historians‚Äô would make use of these same historical arguments in order to legitimise their political ambitions in Ireland. My own research for my MA dissertation actually looked at the process of colonial identity formation in 17th century Ireland through the lens of a particular historical text, and indeed in that work we find exactly the same arguments. 

Ultimately, it was this two-pronged approach based on the historical claims of England to Ireland on the one hand, and the barbarity of its native inhabitants on the other, which provided the necessary justification for conquest. *Laudabiliter* was a very important part of this, but it was far from the only part. 

**Were they going to anyway?**

In [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rdbkel/what_were_strongbows_objectives_in_ireland/) about Strongbow‚Äôs motivations I touch a bit on the political circumstances which led to the English invasion. The long and short of it is that although the English could conjure up all kinds of justifications for their right to rule Ireland, the initial invasion was more of a product of opportunism and expansion on the part of individual lords. King Henry II did not invade Ireland in the 1150s when the *Laudabiliter* was allegedly granted; perhaps he might not have invaded at all if the likes of Strongbow and other lords had not allied with the King of Leinster. 

Yet the English state immediately came in behind these initial incursions, enforcing the authority of the English Crown in Ireland (over the Irish, but also over English adventurers like Strongbow) and attempting to create structures of English law and government. In this sense the *Laudabiliter* was crucial, since it provided a firm footing on which to launch this ‚Äòcivilising mission‚Äô in Ireland. 

**Was there any comment on how ... dehumanizing it depicts the Irish as?**

This dehumanization was part and parcel of English imperialist ideologies of government. In effect, this was the entire point. In portraying the Irish as a barbarous people this justifies English imperialism on the basis that it would be a civilization mission, bringing light into Darkest Ireland. As John Dillingham has noted:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe moral justification, set out in *Laudabiliter* as well as in forged papal privileges, was that since the Irish were a barbarous and sinful people, it was right that Henry II should be set as a reforming ruler over them.  

We need to place the *Laudabiliter* within the context of a fundamental ideological shift within the ‚ÄòBritish Isles‚Äô which took place in this century. This saw English civility increasingly defined in contrast to the supposedly barbarous peoples of the Celtic Fringe.

Excerpt:

DIVERSION, THE PRIMARY STRATEGY

Experience has prevent that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep the public undisciplined and ignorant of the basic system principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganized, a nd distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand.

This is achieved by:

(1) disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.

(2) engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:

(a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers.
(b) giving them what they desire - in excess - ""junk food for thought"" - and depriving them of what they really need.

(3) rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities.

These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology.

The general rule is that there is a profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions.

DIVERSION SUMMARY

Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.

Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history.

Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.

Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.

The average rich person isn‚Äôt bezos or trump. They are ppl who created start ups and added value and innovation to the marketplace. Or worked their asses off to become doctors or work in stem fields or busted their ass to start small businesses. Not everything is exploitation. The average entrepreneur isn‚Äôt a billionaire stealings ppls ideas. 

How do you think we had technological advances then? How do you think we had the green revolution that allowed us to support our global population with a limited food supply?

Pointing out anecdotal evidence of a few ppl taken advantage of or Some tyrant billionaires shows you are a bit naive and ignorant of the truth. Not saying asshole rich ppl don‚Äôt exist. I also find it amusing that ppl think if they were given 1 million dollars 1) they could manage it as to not lose it, 2) turn that million into multi millions. It‚Äôs not that easy bud. 

My point of reference, besides data that shows most millionaires and rich aren‚Äôt just trust fund baby‚Äôs and that most are self made, is my own experience. I worked my ass off to advance myself and my families lives. After years of struggling, late nights, almost failing I‚Äôve finally created a lucrative small business. By adding value to the lives of others, by being willing to take risks, by working twice as hard as most ppl around me, by not quitting  I was able to pull it off.  90% of wealthy ppl I know have similar life experiences.  

The fact of the matter is most ppl are not going to put in 80 hr weeks, wake up everyday at 5 am and work till 10 pm, work weekends, eat ramen for 2-3 years, take massive personal and financial risk to pursue their ideas and dreams. Sacrifice personal pleasure. Becoming and *remaining* successful takes years of hard work and extreme discipline. It also takes being smart which unfortunately the majority of society is ignorant and naive. 

Evidence of rich ppl being rich because of hard work and dedication you can reference most ppl in STEM fields, most professional athletes, doctors, Surgeons, most entrepreneurs with successful start ups small businesses etc.

""Tyranny does not flourish because perpetuators are helpless and ignorant of their actions. It flourishes because they actively identify with those who promote vicious acts as virtuous.‚Äù‚ÄîAn academic study into pathocracy

Disgruntled mobs. Martial law. A populace under house arrest. A techno-corporate state wielding its power to immobilize huge swaths of the country. A Constitution in tatters.

Between the riots, lockdowns, political theater, and COVID-19 mandates, 2021 was one for the history books.

In our ongoing pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, here were some of the stumbling blocks that kept us fettered:

Riots, martial law and the Deep State‚Äôs coup. A simmering pot of political tensions boiled over on January 6, 2021, when protesters stormed the Capitol because the jailer of their choice didn‚Äôt get chosen to knock heads for another four years. It took no time at all for the nation‚Äôs capital to be placed under a military lockdown, online speech forums restricted, and individuals with subversive or controversial viewpoints ferreted out, investigated, shamed and/or shunned. The subsequent military occupation of the nation‚Äôs capital by 25,000 troops as part of the so-called ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù transfer of power from one administration to the next was little more than martial law disguised as national security. The January 6 attempt to storm the Capitol by so-called insurrectionists created the perfect crisis for the Deep State‚Äîa.k.a. the Police State a.k.a. the Military Industrial Complex a.k.a. the Techno-Corporate State a.k.a. the Surveillance State‚Äîto swoop in and take control.

The imperial president. All of the imperial powers amassed by Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush‚Äîto kill American citizens without due process, to detain suspects indefinitely, to strip Americans of their citizenship rights, to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause, to suspend laws during wartime, to disregard laws with which he might disagree, to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts, to sanction torture, to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements, to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law, to act as a dictator and a tyrant, above the law and beyond any real accountability‚Äîwere inherited by Joe Biden, the nation‚Äôs 46th president.

The Surveillance State. On any given day, the average American going about his daily business was monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways, by both government and corporate eyes and ears. In such a surveillance ecosystem, we‚Äôre all suspects and databits to be tracked, catalogued and targeted. Consider that it took days, if not hours or minutes, for the FBI to begin the process of identifying, tracking and rounding up those suspected of being part of the Capitol riots. Imagine how quickly government agents could target and round up any segment of society they wanted to based on the digital trails and digital footprints we leave behind.

Digital tyranny. In response to the events of Jan. 6, the tech giants meted out their own version of social justice by way of digital tyranny and corporate censorship. Suddenly, individuals, including those who had no ties to the Capitol riots, began to experience lock outs, suspensions and even deletions of their social media accounts. It signaled a turning point in the battle for control over digital speech, one that leaves ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù on the losing end of the bargain.

A new war on terror. ‚ÄúDomestic terrorism,‚Äù used interchangeably with ‚Äúanti-government,‚Äù ‚Äúextremist‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorist,‚Äù to describe anyone who might fall somewhere on a very broad spectrum of viewpoints that could be considered ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù became the new poster child for expanding the government‚Äôs powers at the expense of civil liberties. As part of his inaugural address, President Biden pledged to wage war on so-called political extremism, ushering in what investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald described as ‚Äúa wave of new domestic police powers and rhetoric in the name of fighting ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô that are carbon copies of many of the worst excesses of the first War on Terror that began nearly twenty years ago.‚Äù The ramifications are so far-reaching as to render almost every American an extremist in word, deed, thought or by association.

Government violence. The death penalty may have been abolished in Virginia in 2021, but government-sanctioned murder and mayhem continued unabated, with the U.S. government acting as judge, jury and executioner over a populace that had already been pre-judged and found guilty, stripped of their rights, and left to suffer at the hands of government agents trained to respond with the utmost degree of violence. Police particularly posed a risk to anyone undergoing a mental health crisis or with special needs whose disabilities may not be immediately apparent.

Culture wars. Political correctness gave way to a more insidious form of group think and mob rule which, coupled with government and corporate censors and a cancel culture determined not to offend ‚Äúcertain‚Äù viewpoints, was all too willing to eradicate views that do not conform. Critical race theory also moved to the forefront of the culture wars.""",1640719959,"extract:  ""tyranny does not flourish because perpetuators are helpless and ignorant of their actions.","helpless and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"helpless and ignorant","helpless",NA,NA,0

"hq6f0y0","There has been loads of them in history. In ancient Rome they had the triumbrant, a conspiracy of three powerful men devised to allow them to rule the empire. It was successful only temporarily before eventually Ceasar killed the other two to become sole ruler. That was a small conspiracy and it imploded as soon as all three members realised they all wanted to be the leader of the trio and thus most powerful person in Rome.

So even in examples of real life conspiracies known to have been conducted, we can see that even a conspiracy of just a few people is tenuous at best as soon as any one conspirator dissents from the others.

They most definitely don't function in a way that they can be both effective and big at the same time.

The bigger the secret or lie, the more people required in the conspiracy. 

The more people involved, the less stable the conspiracy is.

More conspirators = more variables. 

Those two pieces of logic alone are enough to make me skeptical about most of them. 

Additionally, if we take the moon landing conspiracy as an example, we'll see that maintaining this conspiracy would cost an enormous amount of money, and require the cooperation of multiple different organisations and individuals, ranging a variety of fields from science, to media, to law enforcement etc.

Faking what has become one of the biggest moments of the last century of history would require a small population of people to implement. 

Even if only the first moon landing was fake and subsequent ones were real, it would STILL be a monumental cover up to maintain even decades on. 

So with that in mind, would the gains of faking the moon landing be worth the massive, staggering, logistical and financial cost?

How far would the founders or leaders of conspiracy go to protect the secret and how much MORE resources would be required to cover up the stamping out of any leaks? 

How could such a conspiracy be maintained in perpetuity? With society changing, people dying and being born and entering the work force, reshuffling of departments and funding distribution; how would a conspiracy that big survive over time without either old conspirators being discovered or confessing, or new conspirators blowing the whistle or questioning it's purpose? 

Human beings invariably act based on individual, personal motivations.

So if the moon landing was faked, there would be someone somewhere in all that time who would either attempt to personally gain from the conspiracy by revealing it; or you'd have someone somewhere who couldn't morally abide by such a big lie and would want to reveal it. 

the person you send to deal with that person won't deal with them for free, and they can still reveal what they know at any time, if not the conspiracy, then the murder. 

And so, obviously, this would result in a perpetual loop or requiring help and resources to maintain the conspiracy and then having to keep all those conspirators happy and quiet. 

So we can see very fast with the moon landing example why it would be basically impossible. Because the people that believe in it are definitely overestimating the integrity and general ability of people to live with huge knowledge and share it. 

Most other gigantic conspiracy theories would come up against the same problems I just described and a lot of those, such as Flat Earth, don't even have a financial motivation for existing. 

Conspiracy theories involving smaller groups and smaller stakes do exist and I'm less skeptical of those, but then those arent as crazy or exciting as what we think of as conspiracy theories, which generally people mean to be like huge global conspiracies. 

The number one test for a conspiracy theory is to simply ask ""why would anyone conspire to this end?""

If the answer is ""I don't know why anyone would"", the conspiracy theory is bullshit. 

Conspiracy Theories are more like ghost stories and UFO abduction stories for me. There is always some elements of truth or reality in them and therefore a small slither of possibility of being true in some cases which is why they are such a fun rabbit hole to dive down, as entertainment. 

Like the moon landing was not faked. But has the government always told 100 per cent of the truth about it's space program 100 per cent of the time? Of course not. The lies may not be as big as a fake moon landing but knowing they exist adds a tantalising layer of entertainment to any moon landing theory. 

The problem is people are so ready to believe they live inside a cartoon that they believe in these theories because they ultimately want them to be true. 

It certainly would be cool if real life was like the X files hey. 

Only it wouldn't, and it isn't. 

That's the reason so many dumber theories gain popularity. Not because theyre credible but because people just want it to be. 

And they also a lot of times wouldn't mind being known as the person who uncovered the truth. 

Some of my favourite shows like X files and south Park deal with batshit crazy stuff and other people covering it up or lying about it. 

But the one thing I don't like about those shows is the segment of the audience who will always want their own lives to be as crazy and eventful as the characters on the shows and thus are more willing to buy into conspiracy theories because it makes the world more fun. 

But it also makes people dumber, more gullible and ignorant of real problems.

"hpqkjp8","&gt;Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I found a treatment plan that completely got rid of my psychotic symptoms.. And it doesn‚Äôt change the fact, that I had a pretty severe case of drug induced psychosis

I...never said it did?

&gt;it being self-induced is a moot point considering what I went through

Again, not a thing I mentioned, although I will in a moment.

&gt;You‚Äôre basing this off of a few comments that barely scratch the surface of what happened to me.

No, I'm basing this off of my career in research with multiple trainings in human subjects research as well as multiple authorships on peer-reviewed papers.

&gt;Considering it‚Äôs nothing more than a case report, I don‚Äôt understand your reasoning here.

Allow me to explain:

1) As far as I've seen you disclose, you did not obtain any type of IRB or other ethics board approval for this ""experiment"". Given the procedures and experiences you described, it is incredibly unlikely that an IRB would approve such a protocol so I feel confident saying that it probably didn't happen. This alone is enough to make you average research team or journal highly unlikely to draft or publish any information about what you did, because there is a huge amount of legal liability for them if they do.

2) You identify multiple other substances and supplements that you have used, or continued to use, before and during this ""experiment"" period. Causality requires non-spuriousness of results, so regardless of how closely you monitored dosages and kept ample notes, it would be incredibly difficult for a research team to assess and affirm that it was the Blue Lotus that did the work here. **To be clear**: I'm not saying it didn't, I'm saying that from an assessment and reporting standpoint there is not necessarily enough there for them to pass muster for publication.

3) It kind of does matter that this was self-induced, from a research standpoint, for several reasons. Without a trained professional to assess your pre-experiment baseline, assess that your symptomatic presentation meeting the level of psychosis, and then assess your post-intervention resolution of psychotic symptoms, then all anyone has is your word. Unfortunately, self-reporting ""I wasn't psychotic, then I was, then I took Blue Lotus and I wasn't again"" doesn't stand up to peer review. 

Did you know that I went from not running and then trained really hard and ran the 40-meter-dash faster than ever recorded? You weren't there though, and I can't actually demonstrate to you that I was capable of doing it because I don't run anymore, but I swear it totally happened.

4) It also matters that the psychosis was self-induced by specific activities because your case report may not be applicable to broader populations. Psychotic symptoms induced via specific, controlled activities are not necessarily the same as those accidentally induced via substances/activities or induced by mental health. Simply put, there aren't necessarily a whole lot of people who induce psychosis via some combination of intentional cannabis/amphetamine/dph abuse coupled with sleep deprivation, so people who research interventions for psychosis are probably not looking for self-styled ""psychonauts"" as their primary treatment population. **To be clear**: your experience may be a building point for future research (more on that below), but this all makes it extremely unlikely that your case report would be used for any type of publication.

None of this is intending to insult or argue with you, so I'm not sure why you got so defensive. Your anecdote isn't science, although it could be used to spur science. That's an okay thing. However, your behavior was dangerous and would be highly irresponsible to subject others to, so there would have to be massive changes to try to do this as actual research.

&gt;Plus, I think my experience would be incredibly intriguing to a lot of researchers

Probably! There's a hallucinogenics research lab at Hopkins--a guy I went to undergrad with is a researcher there now.

&gt;This statement is highly inaccurate and ignorant of the facts. The church has produced the best and most complete resources on its founding history available in all the world. Ironically, these resources likely provide the factual basis for many of the author's own criticisms of the church as producing a white-washed history.

I can't tell if you are being serious or not. ***Just to give you one example of many*** of the church whitewashing history... I'm wondering where I could go to learn about official church statements and positions from before the priesthood was opened to those of African descent... not the church, that's for sure.

&gt;This sentence is false. At its best, the sentence is highly conjectural. The concept of an ongoing restoration has been a central part of our belief from the outset of the faith. ""We believe that God will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" was written by Joseph Smith.

I'll counter this point with another quote from Boyd K. Packer in 1971 about the gospel, which is reflective of church position:

&gt;*How disappointing when the fullness of the gospel, the whole keyboard, is here upon the earth, that many churches tap on a single key. The note they stress may be essential to a complete harmony of religious experience, but it is, nonetheless, not all there is. It isn‚Äôt the fullness.*

While Joseph Smith and other prophets claimed the idea of continued revelation, IMO a great deal of emphasis was about how the church contained the ***fullness of the gospel***. IMO, the idea of continuing revelation was to add to the gospel, not change, delete or hide it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the author betrays his own uninformed assumptions and bias, and a tendency to make lazy generalizations.

&gt;he pretended to care about Lily's son

Snape did not 'pretend' to care about her son. He straight-up resented him whilst actively protecting him. The entire purpose of this was to portray his own internal conflict as a result of his inability to distinguish Harry as his *own* person. He couldn't help but see James's son nor Lily's son. Not only was this a direct result of his personal trauma with James at Hogwarts, but it was also the built-up guilt from getting Lily killed. This was Snape's outlook for Harry in the *majority* of the series, but we are exposed to a change in his character. 

During the events of HBP, Dumbledore let's Snape in on the secret that Harry needs to die. Snape is shocked at the idea that Dumbledore, the one who forged Snape's path for atonement...""help me protect Lily Potter's son""..., was the one who abolished this motive for Snape. What we also know is that Dumbledore asks Snape, ""how many men and women have you seen die""...to which Snape replied....""lately, only those whom I could not save"". This is a clear indicator that Snape had grown an affinity for doing good for the greater good, not just because of Lily. If you narrow his actions to be solely directed at Lily, you'll realize that you'll struggle to link the many acts/actions he did to this motive. This is obviously because the books portray a general progression in Snape's own personal motives for acting the way he does. 

&gt;So all in all, he's doing it so he doesn't feel guilty. Trying to make up for his horrendous mistake.

I am a new writer and your analysis was very easy to understand. You pointed out problems that I didn't even knew to look for and I will definitely address these issues in my rewrite and further works. 

I agree with your first 2 points. 

The third point, well it was for humour. I hope it didn't come out too annoying, do let me know if it did.

The fourth point, I agree with that too. I didn't realise it due to my lack of experience

The fifth point, I wrote it like that to give the sense of 'mansplaining' by narrator. The narrator is kind of an a-hole, he is arrogant and ignorant of the world he lives in. And petty too. But it may also be a serious issue on my side as a 'writer' and not a 'narrator'. Did the personality of narrator come out right? 

I also agree with points 6 and 7.

Okay, now! I don't wanna be that guy but can you tell me more about humour in the story. I was really worried about that the humour would fall flat. I am not asking for praises (I know how this looks like), does it really flow nice and smooth? Did it feel like I was trying too hard to be funny?

"hous2hf","Idk what‚Äôs happening in this thread, but I gotta agree with the other person who answered that the problem is that it‚Äôs an oversimplification: It doesn't address why people gained that weight in the first place, and therefore why they are likely to regain in if they even lose it. It‚Äôs also become the go to for edgelords who think they‚Äôre so smart for having figured out that ‚Äúcalories in calories out, dummy, it‚Äôs so simple, just stop eating too much and you won‚Äôt be fat!‚Äù I‚Äôm not interested in arguing with anyone who knows deep down that they only come to these kinds of subs to validate their undeserved sense of superiority, so if that‚Äôs you, thanks for the downvotes, it‚Äôs always a refreshing change from my usual, keeps this place from getting too boring you know?

My opinion is that when 70+% of a country is overweight or obese, it‚Äôs insane to see obesity as a moral failing of the individuals, instead of just what happens most of the time when you put a human in that specific environment. So what makes more sense: Helping those humans by acknowledging and empowering them to address whatever factors and influences put them at high risk of obesity to begin with, or parroting a physics formula to them and expecting that to somehow be enough? 

No one who criticises CICO does it because they don‚Äôt get the math; We do it because we think focusing that much on the math misses the point. And we can‚Äôt talk about CICO without talking about the narrative that is usually pushed along with it, which is that obesity is a personal failing that must be addressed as such, through determination and self control. This, first off, moralises an issue that shouldn‚Äôt be moralised; It places the blame on an individual who may not even be aware of all the factors working against them that are driving their hunger and their cravings and so on. So they will struggle and won‚Äôt know why exactly, and meanwhile they hear others who were successful with CICO saying ‚Äúif I can do it anyone can!‚Äù which further reinforces the narrative that their weight problems are a result of a lacking character. This leads to self blame, worsens their mental health and lets the big corporations who make their billions hijacking our reward systems off the hook. Those same companies who lobby for guidelines and legislation that are specifically designed to keep customers confused and ignorant of how they‚Äôre being manipulated. 

Ignoring the bigger picture is also the reason why most diets don‚Äôt work, because without addressing the root causes that got them there and aren't going anywhere on their own, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect any human being to keep the weight off long term through self control alone. Not saying no one has done it, just that it‚Äôs an unfair expectation to have in general.

All this to say, the better alternative to CICO would be considering the whole human and why they have the life style they do, instead of reducing them to a math equation to solve. 

CICO is appealing because it‚Äôs so simple, and we all like being told that a big problem has a simple solution. Whereas the truth is that there‚Äôs no one size fits all solution because for everyone the causes will be different - genetics, mental health, trauma, other health issues, addiction, hormones or metabolism that have been messed up, maybe by decades of brain hijacking processed foods, or by medications, or by yo-yo dieting, socioeconomic status, gut biome, working night shifts or having too many jobs to sleep properly and so on. 

I‚Äôm not saying CICO doesn‚Äôt have a place, it‚Äôs just not the end all be all. For example, CICO is good enough for me when I want to drop a few pounds after the holidays, motivated by the sheer terror that that downs upon my soul at the thought of having to shop for work pants ever again. But when we have an obesity epidemic, we really need to address the whole picture, not just the numbers.",1639702384,"those same companies who lobby for guidelines and legislation that are specifically designed to keep customers confused and ignorant of how they‚Äôre being manipulated.","confused and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"confused and ignorant","confused",NA,NA,0

"hou5b1z","I will say, this on your post, lol.  
A composite Kal-el MOLLYWHOPS goku. Not any of the goofy shit. Just any feat that is logically consistent, and valid with anything else shown from him. Kryptonians are a ridiculous species, and as shown, Kal-el has ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what he is doing.   


He is woefully unprepared and ignorant of his own abilities, which is part of his character. He just... perseveres through grit, Midwestern protestant ideals, and farm boy charm, but coincidentally has a body designed to kill the gods of the universe.  


A couple of times, they show what happens when a kryptonian knows what they are doing, and the source of their powers. Basically they are in essence, 15th dimensional cosmic fusion reactors. They absorb just the tiniest amount of cosmic or food energy, metabolize it, and through said nuclear reactions, turn it into chi. That is stored in the chi dimension, and they, very similarly to dragon ball characters, manipulate the chi psychically, and convert it into energy.  


They have a set amount of automatic defenses and changes hardwired into their bodies, but can self-direct their own evolution using said energy.  
Them being higher dimensional beings, but also not divine beings allows them to influence their own space, which is why they circumvent laws around themselves casually. They are psionic in nature, but it takes a little time and awareness to phase shift if you will. Without wanting, needing, or conceptualizing the usual psionic powers, regular off world kryptonians just don't ever get around to using it in it's raw form. 

 \[Mortal is the wrong word. They are effectively immortal outside of red solar waves.\].  


Using their higher levels of power basically requires paradigm shifts. Kal-el being a corn fed country boy is somewhat of a materialist, He knows he has superpowers and is an alien, but they manifest as things like, super strength, speed, shooting lasers, etc.  
They can essentially use and do anything and everything being so high on the cosmic totem pole, but knowing that you can do everything and knowing HOW to do everything are worlds apart.   


The difference between kal-el and Dr.Manhattan is simply Kal's mindset. The reason Dr. Manhattan can't actually mess with him is because Kal is a trancendental being. He doesn't actually have the capability. Same with Mr.Mxyzptlk.  


Magic essentially only works on him because he thinks it's hocus pocus. He has every tool to be the greatest mage in the verse short of one thing, acceptance.   


  
\---  


Anyhow vs goku, right?  


The thing about kal is that his brain is ridiculous. His personality, I.E, how he perceives himself based on who he wants to be is simple. He's not stupid by any measure. Kal is a complete nerd, but he limits himself based on values. Think about it this way. Superman is CONSTANTLY trying to not be so super. The one thing that he doesn't turn off is his hearing, but even then he selectively ignores things he doesn't want to hear as well. Like, he ACTUALLY has autonomic control.  


That's the best part about being a kryptonian. One of their powers is super-self control. To the point of autohypnosis. If he wills it, eventually it will be done. Superman CAN punch a bad guy and not blow his brains out, because he is constantly in perfect control of his body, and its output, and he can bring his strength all the way down to human levels.  


Usually he doesn't turn his durability off, so he's always going to feel like getting hit by the hardest thing imaginable, but he does usually keep his pain, pressure and temperature senses on in casual day to day. This is why bullets wont pass through him, but he enjoys a hot shower.  


He even limits his problem solving capabilities. A lot of it is just because being a 13th level intellect is stressful, but the kryptonian brain is a marvel. Based on how much DC wants to hype the flash, they will make it so that in a mental aptitude game, he can lose, but, that's really a testament to the speed force allowing speedsters to concentrate on the level that solar-infused kryptonians can.  
Both of them perceive time in attoseconds.  
So learning things is essentially instant. DEEP learning. Not just rote memorization, conceptual mastery takes no time. He has eidetic memory, creativity that far surpasses the rest of creation, full recall, and senses that are in actuality a form of cosmic awareness pared down into normal human frames of reference.  


  


All that being said, Kal would download goku. All the techniques. All of it. Down to ultra instinct. He can SEE EVERYTHING. You think Granola is hell? MY GOD. Superman doesn't do these things because he doesn't HAVE to. It would spoil the fun, essentially.  


When batman gets Kal's powers, those are the times when you see just how insane it can all get. Almost everyone BUT superman ends up using his powers better, because he nerfs himself to oblivion.  


PIS off? No way in hell could Goku win. PIS off, goku existing shows kal everything he needs to stop relying on his ""weaknesses"".  


torquasm is basically a better version of migatte no gokui anyway.  
As good as saiyan transformations are, they don't touch the end scope of the kryptonian.

"hot28j6","I understand where you‚Äôre coming from.  I was very outgoing before I started getting noticeable PCOS symptoms.  I was about 19 when I started gaining a lot of weight and my facial and body hair started changing.  It made me feel very self conscious and it isolated me.  What self esteem I had before then plummeted.  I was hanging around with people who were very superficial, because I was too, and once I felt like I wasn‚Äôt fitting in with their standards of worth anymore, I withdrew from them because I knew how they thought about people like me who didn‚Äôt look a certain way.  I also came from a mentally unhealthy family that put a lot of weight on women‚Äôs appearance and sexual desirability and believed women got their worth and ‚Äúpower‚Äù from those things (many sex workers, abusers, addicts and misogynists in my family).  My mom and her sisters (and some of my cousins) would constantly point out every flaw they perceived in and on me.  I had also been exposed to porn from a young age and that made it all worse.  On top of my body hair and weight changing, I never had regular periods, and during times of high stress, they disappeared all together for several years.  I was even told by two doctors that I may not be able to have kids (I hadn‚Äôt even had sex yet when they told me this, so that was premature and ignorant of them).  I struggled for half a decade before I really started taking a look at the causes of my PCOS symptoms and why I felt the way I did about myself and my body.

I was a teenager in the late 90s, early 2000s when rail thin was in and a ‚Äúhealthy diet‚Äù of ‚Äúlots of whole grains, soy milk and fat free everything‚Äù was at its peak.  Which at the time, I did not know eating that way is HORRIBLE for PCOS.  So here I am in my 20s thinking there‚Äôs something seriously wrong with me, because I‚Äôm eating ‚Äúsuper healthy‚Äù, and exercising, and never losing any weight, and the minute I eat the same thing as my friends, I put on 5 pounds.  So, I started researching, started looking at my lifestyle and my beliefs about my body.  Honestly in the early 2000s, there was barely anything of any substance out there about PCOS.  I wasn‚Äôt even officially diagnosed (with an ultrasound and hormone tests) until I was 30, because my first two doctors just looked at my A1C and body hair and said ‚Äúyep you have it‚Äù...  PCOS diagnosis and treatment was a joke back then.  And I only found one book that didn‚Äôt really tell me much of anything except the symptoms a lot of people have and gave poor diet advice.  I actually had to look at other metabolic and hormonal disorders and connect the dots to make PCOS more than just a ‚Äúyou just need to lose weight‚Äù problem like my first doctor told me, or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat sugar‚Äù like my second doctor told me, or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just lazy, you need to exercise more‚Äù like family and friends told me.  And thank goodness for people who publish research online, because otherwise I never would have made the connection between stress, food intolerances, leaky gut and PCOS.

I started trying out elimination diets and meditation (which finally at age 26 led me to paleo, and various stress managements, which works best for me).  And I found out, my hair and weight gain were not my fault.  Once I started following my own diet and stress reduction/exercise advice, my symptoms started improving by the day.  And the more I researched, the more people I wanted to talk to about it, and the more people I talked to about it, the more I didn‚Äôt feel so isolated and alone.  I stopped focusing so much on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disgusting and worthless‚Äù ‚Äúno one will ever want me‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other women‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be good enough for anyone‚Äù... and started looking at it like ‚ÄúI am human, just like everyone else, I just happen to have a disorder that, when it is out of control, effects my appearance.  I‚Äôm still the passionate, pretty, creative person I have always been.  This is just how my body handles it‚Äôs environment; it is sensitive to what I put in it and what my mind is exposed to, and it has nothing to do with my worth as a human or my worth as a woman.‚Äù

I am 38, married with two kids now, and I have come to the conclusion that I struggled so much because I was trying to get my self worth from 1) my shallow, mentally ill, misogynistic family who doesn‚Äôt know what love and empathy is; and 2) a toxic, porn sick, sexist culture that also puts too much stress on women‚Äôs appearances and doesn‚Äôt care about whole health, individual beauty or real love.

I had a very difficult journey to get where I am, because I didn‚Äôt have anyone I could talk to or who cared or really loved me very much.  I had to do a lot of work on my own and let go of all the superficial, sexist and perfectionistic expectations other people placed on me.  I hang around much healthier, loving and understanding friends now, and I still try to take care of myself, because I want to feel good and live with purpose, but now I also give myself some grace and embrace who I am and what I need in my life.  I need a wholesome diet, special bodily care, compassion and understanding, love and support.

There is nothing wrong with you.  People with PCOS have a condition that sometimes effects their bodies on the outside.  Other people have conditions that may only effect them inside.  My sister is type 1 diabetic and she is the most stereotypically feminine looking woman I‚Äôve ever met.. She is tall and hour glass shaped with little body hair and a pretty face.  She looks like a model on the outside, but on the inside, her body can‚Äôt regulate her blood sugar like most people.  She has to take insulin and take really good care of her body or she could have some serious consequences like losing limbs or her sight or just up and dying anytime.  Other people have cancer, or Parkinson‚Äôs, or allergies, or mental/physical disabilities.

PCOS does not make you a faulty human being.  How well you fit into an ‚Äúideal‚Äù does not determine your worth.  There is nothing wrong with you.  We all have something that makes us human.  You are just as good and as close to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù as anyone else on this planet.",1639677118,"i was even told by two doctors that i may not be able to have kids (i hadn‚Äôt even had sex yet when they told me this, so that was premature and ignorant of them).","premature and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"premature and ignorant","premature",NA,NA,0

In hindsight, this is true. Why didn't *you* say this *before* everyone installed it with the wrong settings? Why didn't *you* announce this to everyone and point out the problem before it was exploited? You seem to be very quick to accuse some guy of negligence when there's a million people using the code without bothering to read the instructions.

See the problem?  ""Something went wrong! We need to find someone to hang!"" That's never an appropriate response.

Your opinion in this case is incorrect.  You might bemoan the fact that one guy doing this for free didn't foresee every ramification of major corporations taking his free work, but that doesn't overrule the SCOTUS.

The fact that you think (say) AT&amp;T should be suing a guy who doesn't get paid for his work, documented how it works, and gave you the source, all for free, because it doesn't work the way ignorant people at AT&amp;T guess they'd like it to work, well, I hope you never do any volunteer work.  https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/

If they feel he has been taken out of context, then they can easily show how he has been taken out of context.

Left wingers do this work all the time to debunk right wing lies. It takes seconds because we know the context and can provide it in an instant.

Right wingers yell ‚Äúyou‚Äôre taking him out of context‚Äù and then can‚Äôt provide any of that context. If they know enough to know he‚Äôs been taken out of context then they can provide said context.

What they usually mean is ‚ÄúI like this person and have listened to them for hundreds of hours, and what you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt match the warm fuzzy feeling JBP gives me when he tells me I‚Äôm a good special who doesn‚Äôt have to work on anything regarding society and that being selfish and ignorant of discrimination is actually a virtue.‚Äù

Make them show their work. If they can‚Äôt show their work then they can shut their mouths (and they usually do).

"hoafikg","Don't worry, I had no troubles understanding either, I'm ESL so I know how you feel.

1. That is completely true, no one forced Syanna to continue the cycle of rage and hatred she was thrown in, and she chose to continue it on her own will via blackmail (I mean, I do understand that probably she wouldn't have been able to murder four hyper-protected high status knights on her own, but she could have at least tried to concoct some other plan, or she could have asked Dettlaff when they were still lovers, maybe this too could be pinned down to bad writing). Likewise, no one forced Dettlaff to continue the cycle of rage and hatred he was thrown in, and he chose to continue it on his own will via massacre (again, if it was not for bad writing, him infiltrating the ducal palace and threatening Anna would have accomplished the same without need for bloodshed). It's why they mirror each other so much and their path is specular up to the point where each commits his/her own gravest crime.
2. My bad, I probably either misread or misinterpreted what you said in the first reply then.
3. Yeah, bad writing sadly almost ruined the gaming experience for me, and I don't know why but it seemed particularly glaring in this DLC specifically. Sadly I tend to overthink some particular issues (as you can see here lol) and that doesn't go well with instances of bad writing.
4. "" But I personally can't get over the fact that she tried to fuck Geralt while at the same time people died in Beauclair, lol"" Lmao yes, I don't know whether that should honestly be a point against her (since she looks like he is seducing him for her own ends) or in favour of her (since she says it's her last wish which means she is aware she'll very likely not survive the meeting but goes regardless). 
5. Yes, the fact that both are grey characters which you know are capable of both good or bad and have points in favour and against is what makes the choice so difficult. Honestly in my first playthrough I was trying to punish **and** redeem both of them since I saw potentiality for that and hoped they could still be saved, I only resolved to fight him when she unexpectedly disappeared (I thought the ribbon was some dumb sidequest at first) and I was not left with other choice but defending myself. Which I guess also allowed me to make peace with my conscience  as I was not even choosing to attack first. 
6. I mean, that's the beauty of it, everyone can see it a different perspective. As I said, for me, since I was trying to redeem both at the end of the day, the good ending felt like the best available because I offered  both a chance and managed to redeem the one who took it and could break free of this cycle of hatred, step up, forgive and face justice which I felt was the best way to end this tale of spite and vengeance, but I understand others may see another conclusion as more favourable. I also found the worst ending quite interesting, though as I don't know whether you've seen it I won't talk about it for now lol. Regis says he knows Dettlaff very well, and it shows before the night of the long fangs, but he also says he will not very likely attack Syanna at Tesham Mutna (which we know he  does), which could either be meant to mirror the duchess' overprotective attitude towards Syanna, or be a sign that Dettlaff's anger has gotten him to a point where even Regis struggles to recognize him, or just be another writing issue. And yes, very interesting observation that Geralt being neutral and ignorant of the matter can be both the best and worst judge available.
7. Well yes, that brings us back at point 1 and the cycle thing. No one gets dragged in willingly, everyone has a choice to stop right there, everyone chooses to continue the cycle of vengeance. The reason why I got the good ending was merely because I kept very stubbornly searching for the one who could manage to climb out of this cycle without the need of spilling more blood.

"hnwbezf","I would certainly agree that there are parallels between the two myths although they are not synonymous. It is obvious that Greek mythology influenced Gnosticism and is very much part of the tradition otherwise the Orphic hymns wouldn't be present within it. Gnosticism is more of a coagulation between Greek mythology and Christianity or an extension to it. Gnosticism utilizes the didactic method of creating mythos to teach morality and in this case preserve Greek Philosophy,  primarily Neoplatonism and the conservation of the Logos which it was known at the time was slowly vanishes from society where we reach today and very little if any understanding of the Logos exists in common society. It can be postulated the Gnostics foresaw the downfall of the Greek philosophers as they began to be replaced by religious leaders in Rome and in a way ""stole the Logos"" the keep it preserved if again one sought to discover it. 

You mentioned that the goal is to reunite Sophia with Yaldabaoth and return him to the Pleroma. Not exactly. 

Not sure where you got that idea although you are more then welcome to indicate a source. 

In the gnostic text known as ""On the Origin of the World"" it actually states the opposite: 

""She will cast them down into the Abyss. They will be obliterated for their wickedness."" 

""...When he has destroyed them, he will turn against himself and destroy himself until he ceases to exist."" 

In other words the archons and demiurge are cast into the abyss where they destroy each other and there is no reconciliation and hauling them back to Olympus or into the Pleroma to corrupt it. 

As for the analogy the politicians are the archons like Sabaoth instigating subjection and tyranny and the Demiurge is a much bigger issue which spawned and influenced the politicians. In other words blame the politicians and their egos unless of course they are a benevolent politician although they are ""the rulers"".

The reasons is a combination of having to constantly be looking to book time off while working to ensure you can take your travel based vacation, but your not allowed to do that while on the clock.

Even if they take paid time off to leave early, it'll mean they won't have enough concurrent time to take a few days vacation at a time. Also, the workplace has a highschool social hierarchy vibe amongst the workers and ther higher ups.

If you and others like you understood these bare basic minimal reasons.  Then you and others could focus your energy towards realistic change.  Because any pathway to alter gun ownership and usage in the USA must absolutely follow the underpinnings of their foundation of government, *unique to them*. To push in any other direction is useless and futile. When you, and others like you, push in this useless direction, the opposition you face is immovable. You, and others like you, see this as a reason to push harder.

I've been trying to put my thoughts into words about this for a while and I think it boils down to the collapse of our collective intelligence, something I've had a first-hand look at through my job. This is separate from, though related to, the misinformation / disinformation issue. In my job I deal with people of all ages, classes, and groups from society, and personally I have a fairly wide swath of friends and acquaintances from many cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs. What I've began to notice among everyone is like a short-circuiting. No one seems to know anything about anything anymore, or how to do anything, or how anything works, and do not understand the basics of basic concepts that were common knowledge a decade or so ago. No one knows how to write a correct simple sentence, no one knows where or how to find accurate information. No one reads. No one cares to learn anything. I want to call this the Tik Tok culture and a lot of it is due to rampant denial and distraction. 

This spans generations but I am particularly worried about our young people. They are totally detached from reality...lost in their phones, bereft and dejected and depressed and ignorant of so, so much. I can't tell you the number of older teens or people in their 20s that have asked me how to address an envelope or where to obtain a postage stamp and how to use it. The majority of the ones I deal with or know personally are completely consumed with ""going viral"" in some way, either through their social media accounts or through their music or other hustles. So many rappers who are sure they will end up like Drake or someone. I really fear for the young people when SHTF.  I do admire so much about the younger crowd, but I personally know several within a small geographic area who are aspiring rappers, or have started clothing or cosmetic ""companies"" and such. One high school kid I know of wrote a ""book"" about his difficult early life in the system. It's great that the did that and I supported him by buying copies (I try to support the other ""companies"" sometimes too), but the book was just horribly put-together. I know he paid a ""publisher"" to publish and print the book, but there were hundreds of grammatical errors and misspellings in just about 50 pages...it was the worst I've ever seen in that regard (I'm not referring to the content or theme). I don't think he even had anyone try to edit it in the least. I admire these kids' motivation, and some do have some talent, but most them have zero practical basic skills and I really fear for them. Every time I have the opportunity, I tell young people to please learn some practical skills or something that might help you put food on the table some day. I get blank stares most of the time. Do they even understand what I am talking about?

I'm GenX. For my generation and older, this manifests as the inability to do anything at all online for many, leaving them cut off from important services and interactions.  I deal with people who don't have the dexterity to operate a computer mouse because they've never done it, but now they need immediate access to online resources to deal with critical health or job or benefits or housing issues. Navigating emails, passwords, logins, etc.,is truly a never-ending nightmare for some people. 

It's like we have had information overload and sensory overload to the point that our brains have short-circuited. 

I don't want to be that person who says, ""When I was your age..."", because I'm not that person. But to compare my childhood in the 70s, my teens in the 80s, and young adulthood in the 90s to where we are now, is shocking. A noticeable decline in mental functioning from which we are now seeing the results in many ways. Even in the early 90s, we were still writing letters, not so long ago yet light years ago. I remember when it was the norm to exercise your mental functions almost constantly by having intelligent conversations, working out problems and finding solutions, making things, reading books and magazines, writing letters, working puzzles, etc., etc. All these things and others worked together to keep our brains sharp. 

Before the Internet and social media, back in the 90s and before, it was really sort of hard to fall victim to mis- and disinformation. Either you knew something, or you didn't. If you didn't know something and wanted to learn, you had to make a conscious effort to learn it and it took work and time. You had to go to a library, read a book, subscribe to journals or magazines, attend classes and lectures, etc. Idiots didn't have much of a basis (or a computer in our hand full of info and disinfo) upon which to counter information or ideas or what have you with conspiracy theories or false information. A few may have spouted off craziness but those people were mostly considered kooky people by everyone else. You may have been misinformed about something from an individual, but that was about it. If a publication published an error, they had to retract it and it was a pretty big deal. Back then, most people also knew enough to know when they didn't know something, and accepted expert opinion and advice.

Everyone is desperate to make a buck and the rich and corporations are ramping it up. It's like that's all we know in this country. My email box has exploded with random ""offers"", ""reminders"", and outright scams. I always got a few, but it seems like it has increased exponentially recently. I can clear them and then check back in 30 minutes and there are a dozen more, when I used to get about a dozen a day or less, for years. I've also noticed that most of the talk shows almost always now have segments where they are trying to sell something, I even noticed this on local news and talk shows.  I don't really remember this happening a few years ago. 

Lastly, the quality of absolutely everything continues to decline at a rapid rate. I noticed this week at work that the paper towels we buy have become a poorer quality and the liquid soap refills are so thin now that they are basically just very airy foam, not really even suitable for soap .

"hmm5udd","&gt;People who find German stuff from WW1 and WW2 more interesting than American stuff from WW1 and WW2 I‚Äôll never understand. Their equipment, tactics, leadership, etc. was worse almost across the board. And they lost. I can understand the war trophy thing but that‚Äôs not why people get into it.

Lol, none of this is true. WW1 Germany developed small unit tactics, decentralized command structures, defense in depth tactics, the first inklings of special forces tactics and training, the first widely fielded man portable automatic weapons (smgs, pdws, and lmgs), the first to widely field helmets (with the stahlhelm design still in use today), the leaders in development of aircraft technology and tactics, the leaders in development of submarine technology and tactics, and I could go on.

WW1 America was literally using Spanish American War tactics once they entered the conflict. They had to borrow equipment from the French and copy equipment from the British. Their main infantry rifle was a copy of the German Mauser - Springfield even had to pay royalties to Mauser. They never developed anything technologically significant that was used in the war and most of their cool designs were developed after the conflict was largely decided and were never widely fielded.

You have a case for WW2, but I don't think you really have any idea what you are talking about with regards to WW1 as Germany outclassed America in basically every single metric and area of expertise, especially when taking into account the lack of raw materials the Germans had compared to America. Look at the casualty numbers of the Americans in relation to the British or French after they entered the war. To say the Americans had superior tactics and equipment to anyone else in the conflict is false and ignorant of history.

"hmjrqdp","I suggest taking a class. Rhyme and meter are not the only tool in a poet's arsenal. They are merely that, two tools. Like a line break is a tool, assonance is a tool, anaphora is a tool etc. Prose poetry is an art and is certainly poetry. Erasure poetry is also certainly poetry though the source text is usually prose. To narrow the definition of ""poetry"" down to two tools of very reductive. And super outdated. Free verse has been the main mode of poets for almost 100 years. The main mode of people that spend their lives studying poetry. People that win awards from the critics and most learned students of poetry. 

To put it another way that may help make sense: it's kinda like saying 'only structures using classical architecture can be considered buildings.' 

Or: 'Only paintings and sculptures can be considered art, photography is just a representation of life that exists outside of the camera's lens.'

Or animation is only for children, or hip hop isn't music because it doesn't use instruments... it's a gatekeeping that, to folks who have spent the time studying the subject, seems silly and ignorant of the craft put into the art. Ignorant as in unknowing, not dumb or anything like that. 

Again, I definitely suggest taking a poetry class, you'll learn about the craft of the free verse line break, about the nuance and specificity that free verse allows, the natural language it employs (or intentionally avoids), about sonics employed not just at the end of lines but within them, throughout them. About the variations of sentence structure, the impact of line length etc. There's a whole world of craft in free verse, and to say that only poets that rhyme or write in meter work on their poems is just, well, I hate to use the polarizing word again but it's the right word, ignorant.

"hmj5d9h","&gt; A curious take, considering this decision to be perfectly reasonable - a grown adult consciously waiting five years for a thirteen-year-old to become eighteen. That would strike the law as a bit curious, if not outright disturbing. Grooming is not inherently sexual in nature - it can be romantic, social, anything that gears a child up to follow a certain agenda or life path. I do agree that it is quite easy to see it as grooming, as you stated.

I said the logic behind it is sound in the moment, but when you look to the situation as a whole, then it becomes a lot more concerning. That being said, the definition of grooming is to prime the child in advance of committing a sexual offence. That is the definition, I would ask what definition you are using. According to the legal definition, this did not occur. But it is still a bit eyebrow-raising, to be sure, and definitely a misstep.

&gt; I don‚Äôt believe mental illness is a valid defense for this kind of behavior. I see and understand that you have Asperger‚Äôs, that Jonochrome is on the autism spectrum, but pedophilia in itself is a separate mental illness - or, if you wish to argue that it is not in fact pedophilia, an attraction to those young enough to be subservient, to be controlled into becoming a lover. Either way, it is wrong, and these illnesses do not stack; one does not excuse another. 

I do not believe Jonochrome to be a paedophile whatsoever. Paedophilia is the sexual attraction to minors, period. Jono has made it clear, the attraction was purely due to meshing personalities. This was not an IRL meeting, there was no physical aspect to the situation whatsoever.

That being said, I do 100% chalk it to aspergers because I can see the reasoning myself, and it is typical for someone with aspergers, when faced with an in-the-moment issue, to find solutions that seem perfectly rational, but are blinkered.

As for control, Jono made it clear, he did not desire any control over them, and said they'd understand if they wished to date someone else. The issue really is that his influence as a developer probably gave him that power which he explicitly tried to not have over them.

&gt; Consider again - nothing sexual would be pursued until she was an adult. He openly admitted that he has had romantic moments with her throughout the years, and trying to fall in love with her - or, perhaps, feeding into her advances - is a highly questionable decision.

Highly questionable, yes. But the scenario has played out, and from the ending we know, Jono had no intent to go sexual. If we were in the midst of this scenario, we would have a far more concerning  situation. As it is, it ended with no sexual offences whatsoever. Jonochrome was telling the truth, he planned to wait until they were older before even considering that sort of relationship.

&gt; I understand that it is hard to find the afflicted‚Äôs side of this issue, as the account in question has been purged, I believe Jonochrome himself has mentioned this fact in one of his Twitlonger posts, noting how the afflicted broke communication with him because she could not explore any other opportunities for relationships, as she felt like she was basically ensnared by Jonochrome, a man several years her senior.

This was a self-imposed feeling, as she also stated. It was not Jono's intention. It is certainly an element of not understanding one's own fame, and how it influences others. many have fallen foul of that, and it strikes me as unsurprising Jono did as well. It was for sure a misstep on his part yet again, but I cannot see any malice or intent.

&gt; I hope this has been enlightening, and that you will understand the reason for all of this vitriol toward Jonochrome. I know what he supplied for his FNaFLore page - it‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs turned out like this. 

Oh, I understand the vitriol. some are disgusted and don't wish to hear it, some want to just cancel him, and some are morally repulsed at the entire situation, even after hearing it out. I can fully understand. But I feel the labels being thrown around are far too harsh.

Jonochrome is not sexually attracted to kids. He felt his personality meshed with someone who was a minor, and was happy to wait until they were older before pursuing a relationship. In isolation, it could be seen as a perfectly reasonable and understandable situation. Which again, is a big aspect of Aspergers, the inability to see beyond isolation of the scenario presented.

As for grooming, grooming is to prime a child in order to commit a sexual offence. that's the definition, and that is not what occurred here.

I fully, fully understand the situation. it is terrible, and a massive blunder on Jono's part. But I just don't see the malice and intent.

Call him out for his obliviousness to the situation, call it out as stupid, concerning, reckless and ignorant of the situation he was in, but I just don't see the malice or intent - both of which are needed for either charge. But certainly, it was sketchy, I can easily see that. It also most certainly wasn't correct or good.

But if I were in his position, I could see myself make the same deal. I'm just thankful, as I only look up in age for reasons likely not appropriate in this subreddit, this kind of misstep is not one I will ever make. but I can damn well see some alternate Kizz doing the same, with the same blinkered vision that'd make me blind to the wider implications of waiting.",1638194553,"call him out for his obliviousness to the situation, call it out as stupid, concerning, reckless and ignorant of the situation he was in, but i just don't see the malice or intent - both of which are needed for either charge.","reckless and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"reckless and ignorant","reckless",NA,NA,0

"hmhrql3","Remember when you're team launched a political campaign about how bad benghazi was because a handful of Americans died and then turned around and fully supported Trump purposefully dismantling the pandemic response team followed by Trump blatantly lying about a worldwide pandemic causing the death of nearly a million Americans? 

Oh almost forgot how Trump also took credit for the global cooperation for the vaccine (a vaccine which is based off research started nearly a decade ago, hence why it was so close to completion for a novel coronavirus already) while also attempting to buy out foreign companies and privatize the vaccine for his personal financial benefit. 

Oh also almost forgot that time one specific political sports team threw a fit about Hillary having poor cyber security etiquette with how she managed her emails and servers but fully supported Trump literally colluding with Russia and also literally blackmailing a foreign country to do his political bidding by withholding aid (something he admitted to in a phone call that everyone heard but for some reason didn't care about) 

Yeah Clinton corrupt tho. 

Democrats and Republicans have a bipartisan supportive stance of maintaining military action all over the world because the military industrial complex pays for the majority of these politicians. Saying Hillary would have a worse stance on war stuff than any other politician is irrelevant and ignorant of the driving force on American policy. 

Remember when George Bush lied about who caused 9/11 to the world as justification for war against a word (terror)? Yeah both sides agreed on that, if you go back and look ANY dissenting opinion or outlier in that time period is simply gone from the political stage now. They were blacklisted and fired or removed from whatever positions they held, meanwhile the mostly Saudi Arabian hijackers got tied to Afghanistan. Also don't look into how in the few days post 9/11 all the Saudi connections in America where quietly removed back to the safety of their country, just in case. 

The patriot act is literally one of the most authoritarian things you can do, it's a complete and total removal of American rights AND human rights as long as the people who are removing those rights from you call you a terrorist, again mostly bipartisan support. 

Obama started a drone warfare program leading to America literally assassinating people at will and no one disapproved, again bipartisan support. 


See, the problem is that some of us who are more left, or even very left, generally are able to look at bad things done by politicians on ""our"" (although every American politican is far right by default, and democrats are just far right but maybe just a tiny left of that) side and say ""this is fucking bad shit, we should change stuff"" yet the other team just wants to be a winner and cares more about fostering a sence of safety in their minds than actual reality. 

Trump was the worst option of the avaliable options, he did bad things (worse than Hillary did, objectively, unless you don't value human life or ethical representation of the people), but Hillary is not a good choice. Biden is a bad choice (aka MR racist crime act). 

The problem is, in order to even GET the option for better choices in politicians MORE people need to be educated and WANT the necessary changes, not just some of the more left sided people. But we don't have that, we have a large percentage of the population unwilling to ever denounce a single act from a politician on their side no matter how abhorrent, and instead of advocating for the betterment of everyone in the country operate on a ""I got mine fuck you"" mentality mixed with a ""I BELIEVE  I'm right regardless of facts and evidence and I REFUSE to incorporate new information into my beliefs"". 

Hence we get Trump. 

Hence we get you, actually arguing about the NOT PRESIDENT based on the NON ACTIONS SHE TOOK in a hypothetical NON EXISTANT REALITY instead of going ""oh shit Trump was bad, let's maybe just say he was bad and move on and maybe make a better choice""",1638159976,"saying hillary would have a worse stance on war stuff than any other politician is irrelevant and ignorant of the driving force on american policy.","irrelevant and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"irrelevant and ignorant","irrelevant",NA,NA,0

this is a simple one. what did your doctor tell you to do? probably not the best time to overanalyze or second guess things because you have no clue at 5 days how your body is going to respond to hormones as they've been prescribed to you.

&amp;#x200B;

""last in the blood"" is highly subjective and ignorant of the metabolites of estradiol and first pass metabolism. even taking estradiol orally (not sublingually), it will often get converted into estrone and then estrone sulfate, at which point it serves as a reserve to get converted back into estradiol.

the kicker is that this conversion process is all highly dependent on your enzyme expression. some people have amazing levels on oral estradiol and don't need to do anything more complicated, while others will have really high estrone conversion with much less conversion back to estradiol meaning their receptors get flooded with estrone or nothing at all causing much less feminizing effects.

you don't have any lab results to give an opinion on, and you're way too early on hormones to be worrying about levels and conversions, etc.

Disrespectful and eneducated.  Covid wiped people's memories or something.  Very confusing top 25 going into this year.  Didn't take long for cream to rise.  BTW I meant no disrespect to Texas or Memphis, they just came to mind as examples of schools who sat above Duke in the pre-season polls that had Duke outside the top ten looking in... looking in at some curious names and faces.  Texas did unprecedented things with that transfer portal and a first year coach that wasnt in the greatest position (after that fall apart at the end of last season in terms of the first round exit), and Penny has Memphis feeling more relevant then they have in 15 years.  I understand the excitement, and I'm excited too.  But to have these teams rising at the expense of Duke just seemed ignorant and confusing, I've been confused by this since the very first preseason poll (released 5 minutes after the year prior tournament concludes).

"hm9qe02","&gt;how is a man going to know about those things unless he meets and speaks with a variety of women from different walks of life? You've argued   
against yourself there.

I see no contradiction. An author can write about something that they are completely unfamiliar and ignorant of. In fact, that can make for very interesting storytelling. You can write a story that's bizarre, detached, unrelatable and it still can be a good story. You're narrowing the possibility of writing into something that can only be done from a place of personal experience and familiarity, and that's certainly a good way of writing, but not the only way of writing.

And speaking of lived experience, it's impossible to argue with this expanded definition that you're presenting, which ranges from either the very personal and autobiographical, or coming from deep research, all the way over to the vaguest sense of shared humanity. Well, to the latter, everyone has ""experience"" in some capacity, and so anyone can write from their ""experience"", effectively rendering any discussion on the subject completely moot. So of course what I'm arguing against is that the former is a necessary condition to write a good story.

The point is that you don't have to have lived experience on a subject to write about it. Like you said, your grand story can be about themes or ideas over which the plot is just a tool to make a point. Or your story can exactly explore unfamiliarity. In this sense, writing from deep research into womanhood as a man can be just an interesting starting point as writing from an absolute refusal to know or learn anything about women and making stuff up completely from imagination. 

Finally, and just a caveat with your take on fantasy writing, yes authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to tackle big questions from the standpoint of a made-up world. But so are the intricate systems of magic, the bizarre made-up cultures and creatures, and so on, and I disagree that these are subsidiary.",1638018292,"an author can write about something that they are completely unfamiliar and ignorant of.","unfamiliar and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"completely unfamiliar and ignorant","unfamiliar",NA,"completely",0

"hm8gh1l","&gt; I'm aware the change is hard. Hell I used to be just like you

I already know this is going to be bullshit before reading any of this. This is how an ""ex-gay"" or ""ex-atheist"" talks. Change isn't hard. I'm unwilling. Period. 

You reason like this because this is how vegan propoganda is reasoned to you. 

Now on to the rest of this disaster...

&gt; It is helping with alternatives

No its not. Consumption is still growing with population. You are not decreasing emissions. You are merely taking advantage of a crisis to gain converts. 

&gt; look at the milk aisle at your grocery store. It's shrinking

Its not. This is a person anecdote. 

&gt; Abstaining from an unethical practice isn't even morally virtuous, it's just the floor. 

This means nothing. And no drinking milk and eating meat is not unethical. You're merely claiming that it is because you can't reason that it is without pandering it like a cult believer. We are biologically adapted to subsist on meat. Its responsible for the rapid growth of the human brain ever since homo erectus transitioned to large game almost 3 million years ago. And its responsible for our population explosion during and following the neolithic period and every period since. Even the population of the US has beef to thank for that. 

Claiming that killing for food is unethical is history blind and ignorant of evolution and biology. You are merely drawing an arbitrary line in the sand based on pseudointellectualism and anthropomorphism. One that the vast majority of the world actively disagrees with you on. So no, you have zero legs to stand on for an argument about morality. 

&gt; I don't even particularly like animals, cute or otherwise. 

I'm not surprised the vegan idealist has no real world experience. I used to raise animals. 

&gt;  I just don't want to throw them into a meat grinder alive, they deserve better than that. 

Wants and opinions should be based on reasons. Not appeals because ""meat grinder alive"" has a perceived negative connotation. That doesn't constitute an argument. Its an appeal. 

&gt; Slavery, clan warfare, women not having say in society, children working and being beaten are all ancient cultural practices that have survived for hundreds if not thousands of years. 

Those are all human rights issues. Humans are not animals. You can not apply human ideals to animals that can not uphold those ideals themselves. Animals can't make agreements. They can't obey laws. Nor should there be laws prohibiting human beings from a biological need. Which yes meat is. You can choose to subsist on other stuff. But so can other people. You don't get to decide what they need and what they don't. They do. 

The world will never convert to veganism. Its not better. Its not healthier. Meat objectively tastes better because we're adapted to it. And when we have lab grown meat is will be the more efficient and nutrient dense food stuff available to us. 

Most of your points are just deflection and appeals btw. You're not making affirmative claims or adding to the conversation. You're giving me your opinion as if that enough is good reason to believe. That's what gossip is. You need to base your beliefs on a standard of evidence. You can't expect to come to accurate conclusion if you standard is some unquantifiable, unspoken, subjective feeling. 

&gt; The opposite in fact, it's non-human animals that you're showing blatant disregard for. 

No. Not blatant disregard. Nature. Human beings aren't disregarding animals when they eat them. They're eating them. That's normal behavior. Other animals do the exact same thing. 

&gt; Again, I don't care about culture when it stacks up against ethics.

There is no basis for your ethics. You're not supporting your views. You're just gossiping.

&gt; Populations have depended on sacking and looting villages, I don't think that's a cultural practice that outweighs it's harm. 

Populations depended on leather for water proof boots so people wouldn't get food rot. They depended on wool and furs so they wouldn't freeze to death in the winter. Yes the benefits outweigh the harms. We're alive. We're here because of those practices. 

&gt; This is anti-scientific garbage 

What a stupid statement in the face of actual facts. It is scientific fact. Not the game of opposites you vegans play. 

&gt;  I would be willing to bet huge sums of money that the vast majority of neurologists would strongly disagree with this characterization.

I'm guessing you're not rich. Single celled choanoflagellates, the last single celled ancestor of all animals, relied on dopamine and GABA signalling to organize into colonies, and ultimately into multicellular organisms. Neurons only specialize in what all cells have been doing for almost a billion years. Well before the evolution of neurons. 

In fact, comparative studies between mammals and flies with alcohol, and humans and octopodes with ecstacy show remarkable similarities in effects and brain chemistry despite having a completely separate origin for the brain. The brain is not the origin of intelligence. The cell is. And even though plants are sessile, so were sea squirts, the ancestors of chordates and ultimately fish. Organisms evolve back and forth between mobile and sessile lifestyles. The fact that it doesn't move does not mean it doesn't panic. It does, plants panic when it rains and studies on anaesthesia show they respond the same way to suppressing GABA that animals do. The smell of cut grass is also plants communicating the presence of predators. Venus fly traps use a similar calcium channel that we do in our brain to decide whether or not to move. And studies show that rather than being reflexive, that this mechanism actually acts like memory. The plant decides to close only after its sensory hairs get pinged 2 or 3 times over a span of 30 seconds. It remembers and potentially has a rudimentary capacity to count. 

The point is the intelligence is not unique to animals. Its ubiquitous  to life. Since celled organisms can easily be shown to exhibit complex behavior. Its utter hubris to think that starts with animals because you relate to them and think they're cute. Pure anthropocentrism. And then to take your mental simplicity and apply it to real life in an effort to shame people to convert to your belief system is disgusting and deplorable. Especially at the expense of the health of other people. ""Studies say you can be healthy on a vegan diet,"" but serostudies still show that vegans are more likely to struggle with Calcium, Iron and Vitamin D deficiencies, increased risk of infertility and increased likelihood to break bones. Clearly not all of you vegans is getting the message. 

Even the stated ""i would be willing to bet"" is so objectively stupid. So you don't know? That's what you're saying? You'd just like to believe? Whatever satisfies your narrative, I guess. /s

Case and point that you're cherry picking the evidence to come to the conclusions you want and not coming to conclusions based on evidence. 

&gt; Plants don't feel pain, period. 

Yes they do. How dare you claim this at face value when you don't know. You don't even care. This has to be the case for your belief to work. But the fact is its not true. Its a 19th century generalization, like christians citing neoplatonism to justify the existance of their god. A long debunked philosophy that we have better explains for now. 

&gt;  ""Sharing neurotransmitters"" is not a meaningful statement, however dubious. 

It means they feel excitement (dopamine), comfort (GABA), anxiety (glutamate), which is tied into the inflammatory response btw and is about a billion years old and shared across pretty much all eukaryotes, as well as serotonin. Yes that's right. Even plants have serotonin. Their serotinergic circuit for sensing sunlight is the same type of serotinergic circuit in animals for perceiving hunger. They grow towards sunlight because it feels good in the same way that eating food makes you and me feel good. You only don't know this stuff because you're not aware of the actual science. There is no line between plant and animal consciousness. Its a gradient. And there is no state of complete unconsciousness, not even in the smallest single celled bacteria. 

&gt; fervently anti-vegan

You probably just needed a cause. Unlike you I have reasons based on evidence. And an actual knowledge of evolutionary biology, genetics and biochemistry. 

&gt; It was impossible, unreasonable. But 

And every other emotional connotation, I'm sure. /s You really don't know how to give reasons, do you. These are qualifiers. They only describe your interpretation. They don't convey information about real events. 

You've given me no reason to change my mind, nor would I. You'd have to outcompete a lifetime of education in science to convince me. Which is clearly not your strong suit.

"hlvutix","Preorders are basically an indication of demand and therefore revenue. I preorder the big games I guess less because I want to play on launch (tried that with WoW once and my laptop almost melted; the next time I did that with an expac I installed it at launch then allowed it a few days to calm TF down and enjoyed it at my leisure.

I do actually also want to show my interest in a franchise. Devs have to work with what's possible given the corporate logistics of creating a game and the difficulties of gaming communities being up in arms about everything, trivial or not. They can't go on forever polishing a game because they still need to release something to have a revenue stream (which in all probability lies behind the GTA re-releases). While there is definitely awfulness about, the majority of games probably launch with no issues and fulfil expectations. But I wonder where we become our own worst enemies -- where our demands for super-awesome original content right now may be making us look silly and demanding and ignorant of corporate and development realities. 

The more we demand not just good games but complain about 'omg same old same old Ubisoft shit'...the more we look like we have no clue how an industry as complex as gaming runs. It's like in the days of CDs when people complained about paying ¬£15.00 for a disc that cost 10p to make...yeah, if you want a blank disc, pay 10p. Or like how, in my healthcare admin job, people complain about red tape and bureaucracy and only ever want to pay (in taxes because public healthcare) doctors and nurses without realising those doctors and nurses need a vast army behind them to support their work. Or how people complain about Big Pharma when developing new drugs is ludicrously expensive and a dead end 9 times out of 10. Before you start ranting, think of not only the complexity of the infrastructure but also that if you contribute to the stress and overload on devs themselves, you're not going to help that process along.

If you want everyone involved in the game production industry to get paid and be able to invest in new content and somewhere to buy those games and something to play them on (because without game sales your PS5 would cost more than even the worst scalpers are selling it for...)...Jeeze.

"hlvkmly","&gt;Instead of teaching the natives Spanish, the friars instead learned the local languages of the natives - this would prevent them from ""putting on airs"", i.e. becoming learned enough to argue with them  
&gt;  
&gt;it benefited the neglectful Spanish government and the landowning friar orders for Filipino natives to remain ignorant, illiterate and docile

This was true to a large extent esp. in the middle and late parts of Spanish rule, but the colonial period is so staggeringly long that I wonder if the motives and circumstances might've changed depending on specific place and time.

I've also read, I apologise if I can't remember where, that early Spanish friars (like in the first 100 years or such) learned the local languages not so much because they wanted the natives then to stay subservient and ignorant of Spanish law/policy‚Ä¶but mainly due to sheer practicality.

In many of the early towns often the friar was the only Spaniard (and sometimes he wasn't even there all year), which means for large regions in the early Spanish colonial Philippines the friar was the only Spanish speaker around anyway. It would be difficult for him to teach his language to *all* the natives *and expect them to retain it over time*, since only he, the very occasional conquistador, or the tiny handful of native quick learners would be able to help everyone else retain it. It was easier to learn the native languages because the friar could easily learn from and practice with the huge pool of speakers, so likely that's what happened a lot in early colonial towns from like the 1500s to 1700s or so.

(I won't discount that that maybe morphed into an excuse by later, more power-hungry friars for keeping later generations of natives illiterate and ignorant of the Spanish language too. Likely by the 1800s I do agree that thinking would be more common by then.)",1637740132,"(i won't discount that that maybe morphed into an excuse by later, more power-hungry friars for keeping later generations of natives illiterate and ignorant of the spanish language too.","illiterate and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"illiterate and ignorant","illiterate",NA,NA,0

Which is ridiculous on their end, because I'M AN *ADULT* NOW. They've had more than enough time to process! My childhood came and went and they still have not processed or accepted that I am autistic. I'm most likely going to have to get the diagnosis a second time and wave it in their face because when I was growing up, they shot me down every time I tried to open a dialogue about autism and the way they handle me. 

I see a lot of people saying that you may just need to give them time to process and accept it, but honestly that may not be an option. It sounds like they're ableist and ignorant of the condition and I know first-hand that this can keep up forever. Your best bet may be to read up on ASD yourself. Don't turn to things such as ABA Therapy or Autism Speaks which seek to repress the condition; there are PLENTY of autistic youtubers and activists on Instagram that can do wonders in teaching others about autism if you just... stop and hear them out :,)

I recommend Chloe Hayden's YouTube channel, personally. Or Paige Layle's! There's also @fidgets.and.fries on Instagram, who's probably my favorite autism activist of all time. There are books like The Reason I Jump written by actually autistic people that give great insight on what we are really like. Consume that kind of media yourself, and pass it on to them. Hopefully, they'll learn.

""Severe"" autism has never really even been a thing, and the fact that they use that term shows how little they truly understand about it. No autistic person is more or less autistic because that's not really how it works. The ""spectrum"" in ASD doesn't work that way, you're either autistic or you're not: it works in the sense that every trait FROM your autism will have its own spectrum in how much it effects you. So ""severely autistic"" people are actually just, for example, severely sensitive to stimuli like noise and light and therefore suffer meltdowns really easily. They aren't actually any more autistic than someone like me who can handle that kind of thing just fine, because autism is a yes or no question. 

Anyway, education is key to acceptance.

"hlpunpb","&gt;A nation is a community of individuals held together by a common set of ideals, principles, and agreed upon universal rights, however the right to disagree with these rights and principles is de jure enshrined within them as the central piece of these rights and freedoms. Nationhood has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, religion, atheism, the language they speak, or ""who isn't allowed"" to live in a certain place.

This is precisely the New World and colonial approach to nationhood. From Canada to Argentina to Australia and New Zealand, this is how the settler societies define nationhood. Race, ideology, and religion don't matter, what matter is a commitment to an inclusive set of principles. This is American liberalism.

Old World liberalism has been shaped on hundreds of years of warfare, monarchy, feudalism, and later on socialism and communism. The French version of liberalism, indeed all Western/Northern European liberalism has embraced universal rights provided the fact that new arrivals respect the history and culture of those already living inside those societies. French has a commitment to universal rights and egalitarianism, but demands that new arrivals respect what has come before. This includes the fact that the French by in large have rejected religion as an organizing principle of their society, and therefore will not tolerate anyone placing their religious values before their commitment to the betterment of France. 

&gt;Who get's to determine this? You? The government? I assume a French person would rightfully call out McCarthyist ideas about what it means to be an American.

Yes, this is a good point.

But keep in mind, *everyone* benefits from the slow zone. Filling the slow zone up with debris is a huge mistake.

What he leaves out (or at least doesn't expand on) is the idea of some sort of stirring or turnover of nutrients tied up in the fast-reproducers. In the ocean, that's plankton and krill and small fish, kelp, etc. In a grassland that's grass and other herby plants. The more short cycle nutrients (eg. a season or year) are tied up in dead versions of the fast-cycling organisms without being re-made into new, accessible forage, the slower the feedback loop and the less productive the mid-levels of the ecosystem are (eg. whales, large fish, grazers, etc). Grasslands, specifically, evolved to thrive with a very heavy regimen of grazing.

As far as criticisms go, apex predators are a critical element, and fire can be a critical element. Flooding, too. I don't like that he either ignores or dismisses these as inappropriate, but that's an aside considering the fact that he's proposing SOMETHING to fill that role (even if it's something we are doing manually). I would vote to add these back in at some point, and I imagine that will be an ongoing discussion relevant to each overall region.

The other big criticism I would offer is that he makes no real mention of mixing types of grazers-- on a grassland this might be horses, bison, antelope, sheep, or their counterparts for whatever ecosystem/region you are looking at. I'm not sure why he makes no mention of this, if he is promoting livestock, why not suggest allowing mixed herds to rotate at different times the way various herds of gazelle, bufallo, giraffe, etc would? These all have niches that even our cursory understanding suggests should not be ignored, and all I can say is I hope he left this out for the sake of time and simplicity and not because he is ignoring that as a critical fact of his hypothesis.

And I \*really\* don't like that he is so dismissive of native knowledge/experience. Yes, in many instances as a species we've been terrible-- but in just as many instances we've done well in tending the land, and lumping all the geographic and temporal extent of humanity into one basket is...well, it's dumb and ignorant of history. And in this talk, specifically, he literally opened by saying that ""as soon as we removed the humans from the land, it went to shit"", so there's that to illustrate my point here.

"hl66kk4","I have my suspicians that you are Jewish.  No real Jew believes Jesus is a messiah.  And btw, the entire messiah in the old testament is an invention as well, so this is a problem from the get-go.   Archeaology has found the Bible to be embellished storytelling and historical fabrications.  One instance is the book of Daniel with it's many historical mistakes that I pointed out. (This means, by the way, that the Bible has many errors in it.) Additionally, there is zero evidence Moses lived or that over 2 million people wandered around in a desert for 40 years that one can walk the length of in 2 and a half weeks or 3 weeks.   Archaeology also found that YHWH was originally a Canaanite god, one of about 200 different gods the Canaanites worshiped.  As the Canaanites migrated out of the southern Levant area and Hebrew tribes migrated in they adopted YHW as their god.   He was originally a wind and war god and probably also worshiped in the tin mines of Timna as a god of smelting.  He had a consort wife named Asherah. Archaeologists have found small statues of YHWH and Asherah in ancient known Hebrew worship sites.  

So essentially, the Bible is tribal storytelling with an ancient political agenda, written to unite a tribe of people during times of trouble.   Oddly enough, the Biblical god is completely geographical to this particular area on our planet and specifically only concerned with the tribal people who just happened to also write the book about him. Hummm.

"hl277w8","&gt;My first example of what I mean is Kamala Harris. She was selected because of explicit racism, and Democrats are ok with that. Biden straight up said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to pick a black woman.‚Äù So he did. And Democrats don‚Äôt seem to care one bit.

He never said this. He committed to picking a woman but said nothing about race. Regardless, what about this is racist? Aiming for diversity is a bad thing, let alone racist?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Second example is immigration. It seems almost inconceivable to many on the left that people are opposed to immigration for reasons other than race. When Republicans defend their positions, I hear about either the economy, national sovereignty, or cultural values, almost never a word about race.

Yeah, and when people discuss the Civil War they mention ""states rights."" People know racism is bad and so not many people will outwardly say, ""keep brown people out!!!""

But regardless, what you're describing is an extremely narrow, naive idea of racism. The consequences of immigration are inherently racist as it disproportionately affects people of color. We're not policing people coming in from Ireland and Russia. Whether the intention is inherently racist or not is secondary to the fact that the structure of immigration policy is itself racist. And if you support the immigration policy, then you are supporting a racist structure.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Third example. In the California recall election, a common phrase I heard to describe Larry Elder was ‚ÄúThe black face of white supremacy.‚Äù Excuse me? People really believe this stuff? Talk about doublespeak. This dude hardly even mentioned race in his campaign. He‚Äôs black. In a state that is majority Latino. Yet he‚Äôs supposed to be a white supremacist? Imagine if Republicans talked about a white liberal like ‚Äúoh if he‚Äôs elected he‚Äôll betray his race.‚Äù It would be an instant firestorm. But you‚Äôll never hear a Republican say that, because they don‚Äôt generally think in terms of race, Democrats do.

The argument is that his policy positions supported structures of white supremacy. I don't know what his being black or California being majority Latino has to do with anything. Are you trying to argue there weren't Jews who enabled the policy of the Nazis? Or black supporters of the Confederacy? Or women in favor of the patriarchy?

A black person ""betraying his race"" means continuing to uphold structures of racism. You might disagree about whether Elder did so or not, but speaking purely in terms of concept it's a fairly easy one to understand. The only way to dispel that being a possibility is if you think racism against black people doesn't exist in America. Compare that to your example of a white person ""betraying his race."" What would that even mean in the context of modern US society? How are white people being oppressed? What structures are holding back white people that a white governor could maintain or even support?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And finally, Virginia. The day after the elections, I turn on MSNBC, and sure enough, the primary explanation for the Republican win was calling them racists. The same racists who elected Winsome Sears, I guess? The highest ranking woman of Color in Virginia history is a Republican. If they‚Äôre really motivated by racism, they did a crappy job at it. Once again, imagine the fallout if the roles were reversed.

You are once again showing an extremely narrow view of racism. ""Racism"" isn't a binary concept where we all either have it or don't have it permanently. You've done some racist shit. I've done some racist shit. Everyone has. Sometimes consciously, sometimes subconsciously. The idea that electing a black person once erases racism for good is ridiculous. Do you want to claim that the US doesn't have a racism problem because Obama was elected? Do you genuinely think that's a good argument?

The incoming Virginia governor made ""Critical Race Theory,"" which isn't even taught in public schools below the college level, his top campaign priority. [Roughly 1 in 4 Virginia voters](https://apnews.com/article/virginia-election-ap-votecast-survey-75520c5c9a245bee384526abc138a61a) said in exit polls that CRT was their biggest voting issue. Yes, race played a big role in the Virginia governor election. This isn't speculatory. It's literally in the data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or how about Elizabeth Warren? She claimed to be Native. When she took the DNA test, it showed she was only 1/64. She‚Äôs whiter than most Americans, yet felt the need to pretend otherwise. Yet Trump is the real racist for making fun of her, apparently.

Yeah, that was really shitty and ignorant of her. She apologized for it and the Cherokee nation said they believe her apology is sincere. As I said earlier, we are all guilty of racism to some degree in our lives. The idea that we need to have perfect records to point out other people's poor actions and beliefs is an absurd concept that would effectively lead to nobody being able to ever criticize anything ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine if you called 911 to report a drunk driver and the dispatcher responded with, ""oh well remember that time you made an illegal turn 10 years ago?"" That would be fucking stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

But really, let's assume the worst in all of these instances and assert they are as fully ""racist"" as you claim. You really think that makes Democrats ""as racist if not more so"" than Republicans? You earnestly think \~90% of black people in America are voting in favor of racism every election? You think nominating Kamala and Liz saying stupid shit about her DNA test is as bad as or worse than putting Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon in policy positions or using drug wars to imprison black people?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The bottom line is, Democrats insert race into just about every issue wether it legitimately exists or not. In the effort to battle racism, they have largely become. become racists themselves in many cases like I outlined above. This ultimately perpetuates racism more than Republicans could ever hope to.

Because race IS in everything. This country was built on white supremacy and many of the structures are still in place. Black people have less wealth, less upward mobility in the job market, less access to quality education, less access to healthcare, and are punished more harshly by the justice system.

Imagine for a moment if I went into my office every day and took a shit everywhere. I shit on my coworkers' desks. I shit in the breakroom. I shit in the elevator. I shit in the boardroom. I shit in the front lobby. I just take huge shits everywhere, weekly. Now imagine if my coworkers  complained about this every day and my boss responded with, ""why do you guys need to make everything about shitting?""

My coworkers are making everything about my shiting because I am subjecting them to it. It's not their fault for pointing out the shit problem every day. The problem is me, the person shitting everywhere.

Democrats are pointing out that there's shit everywhere. And they'll shut up when America stops shitting all over the office.",1637196839,"yeah, that was really shitty and ignorant of her.","shitty and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"really shitty and ignorant","shitty",NA,"really",0

Parting of the sea... I've seen that.  It was a tidal wave / tsunami.  folks were standing on a sand bar and the water just left the beach, the area between the beach and the sand bar still held waters.  Then a giant wall of water rushed forth and flooded the land, and those poor people who didn't get off the sandbar were goners...

Come with me and I will make you fishers of men... now, look in the waters you came into... see the little fish swimming?  What if I told you a whole man is stored in each of those fish?  Heretical, I know, but them's the breaks.  Sometimes those who decode the obvious wisdoms are called blasphemers.  One fish and one loaf, feeds a multitude.  I simply use two pools of water.  One for the fishery to grow a bunch more fish, and the other a pot of water to ferment the bread into more yeast, with which to make more bread.  It's not as ""magical"" when you have to explain the simple wisdoms... but you're the idiot here, not the biblical authors.  There is a ""magic"" to it, and you don't have to know how the magic works to perform the spell of continual sour-dough starter.  HE IS RISEN! (like bread, or the Sun of god in the ^(y)East...)

Resurrection... please, tell me more about trans-humanism... the sun is almost up.  Meanwhile, I can take humans apart in the dark, and stitch them together into a resurrection machine, if it weren't illegal and the common man didn't become squeamish around wizards.  The bones of this watery life support chamber have living marrow, producing new blood.  Carefully take apart people and arrange the organs around the chamber, and stimulate the diaphram and heart to pump the blood and oxygenate it... feed it with sugary salt water...   And when you throw a man into that tomb (womb, resurrection tank), the bones of Lazarus could indeed still contain enough magic to support the life of a mortally wounded man, and bring him back from what anyone of the time would consider the dead.  Vlad the Impaler had such a bathtub of blood, he was impaling himself (transfusion of young blood prolongs life).   Moses means ""of water"".  The basket he was placed in was this bony ressurection chamber...  Sargon of Akkad, same story as Moses.  Mises of Egypt means ""of water"", similar to the Moses wisdom.  A man of water is a married women, she'll have consummated the wedding, and thus be with the waters of child birth soon...  She's a man of woter.  Hence the ""Wo"" part of woman, and now we call her Misses (sounds like Egypt's Mises to me).  The Scabbard of x-caliber grants Arthur invincibility.  Scabbard means vagina, and this is how you make a man into one, pleb.  This is the old Hermetic wisdom everyone's knows about... /i\\

Egyptians didn't build the pyramids, of course ""slaves"" did.  These ""slaves"" are mechanical things... they follow orders and have no will of their own, like modern day cars and cranes and such are slaves to their operator's whims.   

Jesus contains the mystery of yeast... which do walk on water... they bubble when brewing and iesus (yeasts) float to the top, foaming like the sea foam.  Lumps are men.  These men of the sea are seamen, whenceforth comes aphordite / venus... but also, lakes can freeze slowly and look as if people are walking on water.  When you walk a lot with disciples you get blisters on your feet, which fill with water.  Not so impressive when you spell it out... but it's not just a single thing.  The process of compressing and layering more and more mysteries together, such as the water of fruit being turned into wine by iesus (yeast)... and then made a Virgin Drink by the **V**inegar **M**other, **V**irgin **M**ary...to create vinegar, with witch to pickle milk, thus making curds, and when filtered via cloth, you discover ""men"" (lumps) of the cloth, praise Cheeses!  Now you can have bread, wine and cheese and pickle things for the winter; Cure things with smoke along with the cheeses you nail to the crossmembers to let age in smoke...  Now, you can have proper civilization, and have preserves so you don't fight over food for the winter...  We're saved!

The Koreans had a 20:1 kill/death ratio against the VC. There are numerous US bases in SoKo to this day, and to this day they are prosperous.

"hk9itez","Care to share the evidence of Kyle threatening them and in any way acting threatening prior to the point when he shot them?

The guy kyle killed, literally said ""If I catch you alone, ill kill you"". That same guy pushes you to the ground, and then attempts to steal your firearm... If you **don't** shoot that person in that scenario, you have a sick defective brain.

This is like, the text book case of self defense. Im not sure there has **ever** in all of recorded history, been a case with this much evidence, in which someone so properly acted in self defense. This is very likely going to be cited case law for self defense going into the future.

The irony of talking about flairs, while not living up to yours what so ever. How can you be ""lib"" while supporting the state prosecuting a child, when there is very clear cut evidence, he did no wrongdoing. The only argument is ""having an AR15 under the age of 18, because he's 17"", which again, if youre lib, could only believe that to be the state oppressing someone. The fact this went to trial **at all* is such a violation of his rights, not only should he get a huge payout from the state (and slanderous media), but its a level of tyranny, that should damn near start a revolution...

You must believe ""the right to self defense ends at your doorstep"" (which would mean, homeless people have no right to life), or you just don't believe people have the right to defend themselves from others, at all. Or maybe you are extremely naive and ignorant of reality, and believe something completely childish like ""you have a right to self defense, but not to end someone elses life in the process"". The second amendment exists for the very purpose, of enshrining the right to self defense (using *any* means necessary, including deadly weapons). Its the second amendment, because you have an unalienable right, to protect your life, and the life of your family (and the right of your property, which is actually the major factor between left/right. The right believes property should be considered worth enough to justify ending life to protect, the left does not). The reason it specifically allows the use of firearms, is because those who may wish to end your life, will likely have them. Thus to be equal in ability to defend your own life, you **require** the use of firearms. And the use of firearms, increases the likelyhood loss of life will occur in these situations. (Not that people didnt die from swords/knives when using them for self defense).

Does it suck that life was lost over something like this? Yes. Would the crimes of the perpetrators be considered worthy of the death sentence in a court of law? No. However, when you are acting in self defense, you make a decision (in a split second, no time to think), do you wait until they are half a second from actually ending your life? Do you chance they miss when they try to aim and shoot at you? Do you chance no one comes from behind and  takes your gun? The only way for it to be ""equally just"" to take someones life, is if they have **already taken a life**. Which is why, when someone seems like they may cause you or others, great bodily harm or death, that's when self defense kicks in. It would be lunacy to suggest you don't have a right to self defense, until you are mortally wounded first. In this case, the threshold for self defense has been long long crossed **AND** to top it off, Kyle showed great trigger restraint numerous times during this whole situation. The only argument is ""Kyle should not have been there, if he didn't show up, those 2 men would still be alive"" which is easily reversed to ""If they didn't show up and commit crimes, they would still be alive"". Also, because alternative reality don't actually exist, you have no idea what would have happened, if Kyle was not there. Maybe that gas station blew up, killing 20 people.

You act like Kyle was sitting on his property (or someone he knews property) yelling racial slurs and insults at ""PoC"", and then when they confront him, and one of them steps 0.5"" on his property, he blows them away and claims self defense, when they were unarmed and not even acting all that threatening.",1636672500,"or maybe you are extremely naive and ignorant of reality, and believe something completely childish like ""you have a right to self defense, but not to end someone elses life in the process"".","naive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"extremely naive and ignorant","naive",NA,"extremely",0

"hk8dybh","The real answer is that the uptick will depend on the size of the deal.

In reality, I believe the market has priced in a $0.5B to $1B sale.  BUT that‚Äôs pretty pessimistic and ignorant of the landscape.  Here‚Äôs why...

There are three things going on here that people are having trouble differentiating.

#1 Facebook lost the battle in EU/German court against $BB regarding patent infringement.  They were going to shutdown FB messenger, Insta and WhatsApp but FB finally agreed to settle.  That‚Äôs settlement will be part of this patent deal.  

#2 About 90% of the royalties that $BB had been steadily collecting from various companies were put on hold -and have been on hold - for almost 3 quarters.  These regularity amounted to $500M in royalties per year.  The margins on these were in the order of 90%.  As in, they paid some lawyers and the rest was gravy to the income statement and balance sheet in cash every quarter.  $BB has not been paid these for 10 months and this will invariably be included /accounted for in the payout as well.  

#3 when $BB put FB‚Äôs balls in a vice it perked up the ears of everyone else that had stolen and used $BB Intellectual Property.  This lawsuit set a precedent.  There are dozens of companies.  They will also sign onto this patent deal.

The patent deal will not just be a sale.  What $BB is doing is partitioning off around half their patent portfolio and selling it to a large consortium.  It will be another business entity.  

That entity, which will consist of several billion and trillion dollar companies will 

(1) pay $BB a large sum of money up front, incl. any payments owed in arrears and include compensation /settlements that should have been paid in the past

(2) pay $BB a trailing / annual amount - likely hundreds of millions a year - for up to 7 years.

(3) enable $BB to continue using the IP that this new consortium/ entity will ‚Äúown‚Äù without penalty.

(4) This consortium will also staunchly defend ANYONE who infringed on these patents.  It won‚Äôt be $BB defending these patents.  It‚Äôll be a consortium of Qualcomm, Nvidia, Facebook, Google, BB, (examples), etc defending these patents.  

This payout will be handsome and continuous and I do believe it will add billions to $BB coffers at essentially 100% margins (free cash) over the years.

All of this has been talked about and written about.  Chen has clearly said his goal is to monetize the patent book valuation and spinning it off like this is exactly the way to do it.

The complexity of this deal - as described above - is why this is taking so long to finalized.  But it‚Äôs coming.   If you choose not to be patient, it will likely be at your own peril.  

So let‚Äôs stop bitching and complaining.  
BBeleivers would rather have Chen close the best deal rather than a quick deal.

"hk8djr8","I think it‚Äôs up to every player to craft a backstory that makes sense for their PC, just like any ttrpg. Why does someone become an adventurer in dnd? An investigator in Call of Cthulhu? Join a clan/coterie in VtM? Traveller actually does a pretty good job of throwing out hooks in character creation in the form of events. You can take one of those hooks and expand on it, or you can bring a concept of your own and work it into the character. 

I play a young doctor, who went to university, then joined the marines as a medic after graduation because he wanted to see the galaxy. He did one term of service and decided the military life wasn‚Äôt for him, but he never lost his wanderlust. He was listless for a time after his discharge (and got cut off financially from his uberrich parents) when he, by chance, bumped into another former marine who had been a patient of his, who had a project she was starting, and recruited him to the cause. Nothing else to do, lots of skill and motivation, looking for a new start, he jumped at the opportunity. 

Going into the game, I knew I wanted to play a young character, I wanted to be a medic, and I wanted that character to come from a wealthy background and be a sort of fish-out-of-water in the backwaters of the Reft where the campaign would be set. I knew I wanted him to be privileged and ignorant of what poverty actually looked like, and I wanted him to have skills that made him valuable to helping people that didn‚Äôt just involve throwing his wealth at it (which was how everything was handled throughout his youth). I just brought those concepts, the dice provided their opinions in creation, and I incorporated that into making what I feel is a very fleshed out, well-rounded character concept, with motivations that feel believable.

"hk85cyw","&gt;Atla had far superior writing

With a ton of its own flaws and stupid moments.

&gt;korra losing to someone in her natural element as an avatar is insulting to the avatar as a concept

It never happened. She never lost to anyone in a waterbending fight. And it's as stupid as saying that Aang losing to episode 2 Zuko who was going through his basics, despite being an airbending master, undermines the whole character arc and whatever else dumb shit you were reaching for. 

&gt;Amon never should‚Äôve been able to take an avatar‚Äôs bending. Period

Says who? 

&gt;Hell the original creators had to leave a list of rules and restrictions because even kataang would have been undone if the shithead behind lok had their way

You do realise that AtlA and LoK had the same creators, right?

&gt;It‚Äôs laughable you call out comics for bad writing but cant even recognize the huge drop in quality from atla to lok

It's funny how this drop in quality was never even a part of the conversation and has nothing to do with the topic at hand, but i guess it will do since you ran out of somewhat valid arguments.

&gt;You wanna know what crappy writing looks like? How about a PLATINUM MECHA IN A STEAM PUNK ERA?

Who the fuck told you it was steampunk era? AtlA was may be, the technology moved on significantly since then. We literally see new source of energy very similar to electricity (but much more powerful) discovered and weaponized. Calling it crappy just because you didn't bother to watch the show or didn't pay any attention is weird.

&gt;First off its a mecha out of place for the tech levels l

It doesn't make any less sense than the drill from AtlA. 

&gt;Second, platinum is a brittle metal and would collapse under all that weight

Arguing avatar universe physics... Really? I mean do you REALLY want to open this can of worms?

&gt;But they backed themselves into a corner with platinum being unbendable (despite sterling silver actually being purer than most platinum, and fully refined metals will be pure enough to unbendable in the first place)

For this point to make at least a degree of sense you have to point out at least one instance when they bended something purer than platinum in the show.

&gt;So the writers literally require suspension of basic reality for a plot contrivance

Avatar as a franchise literally started from requiring suspension of basic reality with that hundred years in ice beauty sleep. 

&gt;Thats not good writing, thats lazy, sloppy, and ignorant of their world and the sciences they incorporated into it

It's a world they created, they created its rules, and for the most part these rules are consistent in both shows (which doesn't require them to be consistent with the real world btw).

"hk7eojx","I'm a practicing lawyer who has appeared in significantly greater number of criminal matters than the number links you've sent. Is there a systemic persecution of minorities? Yes. Is it as easy for cops to implicate someone in a fake case as you seem to suggest? Absolutely not. Showing me links of singular instances is not supportive of your argument at all because:

1. Acquittal does not imply false implication by cops at all. So most of the links you've provided are meaningless. Your argument is: Cops can simply falsely implicate someone by adding a name. So for the links to support your argument you have to show cops merely added the names of the people ultimately acquitted to falsely implicate them. Show me an order where the trial court makes an observation about the involvement of the cops in either of the links.
2. Singular links miss out on the larger picture and what actually happens on average. Like i've already stated, there is a systemic persecution of minorities, but is it as overt and easy as you claim? No.

&amp;#x200B;

But i'll also deal with each link individually just so i don't have to waste time on this argument any further.

1. First link is about individuals associated with a banned organization. So like i said in my original comment, it's not as easy under UAPA as randomly naming someone. Cops require something to build a narrative on. That's completely applicable here. Again i'm not justifying what happened, just that you implied that cops can implicate someone out of thin air, which is absolutely untrue.
2. Second link. The guy was actually convicted of stabbing cops. So while he was cleared of the terrorism charges, he did commit a very serious offence, which again gave the cops enough room to create a narrative of him being a terrorist. It wasn't something done out of thin air.
3. Third link. This i agree is one instance where these allegations were made out of nowhere. But so far you're at a 1 out of 3 of a total of 6 links.
4. Fourth link. I'll give this link to you as well, so you're at a 2/4 now.
5. Fifth link. The actions were taken by a special investigation team and not regular cops. An SIT has far broader powers than your typical beat constable or SHO who would stop you so i'm not inclined to consider this relevant.
6. Sixth link. I'll give this link to you as well.

Ultimately, of the tens of thousands of cases that cops deal with every month all across the country, you've been able to show me a grand total of 3 instances where cops implicated people out of thin air. And this exactly is my point.

I'd also like to clarify my stance of police brutality and false implications since you seem to have taken up arms against me. I'm very categorically against them, and i also do recognize it happens. There is no justification for it, and such incidents should be dealt with with criminal charges for the cops involved.

But that's not the point. If you honestly think a random beat constable can falsely implicate anyone in a very serious charge of terrorism or pedophilia, then you're delusional and paranoid. They can't. And for the most part they don't. It's usually cops empowered with greater powers under the UAPA or other draconian statutes who are able to do this, but often even they require something to build the narrative on. Virtually every single link you provided had the investigation carried out by a specialized wing of the police, with much greater powers than your average cop. They're not the ones who will be stopping you at check points. They're not the ones asking for your phone in the present fact scenario. So like i've already said.

"hk1gg7e","Actually storm lost it to an accident where she wasn‚Äôt even the intended target lol

Korra isnt avatar. Its korra. Atla had far superior writing lol

And korra losing to someone in her natural element as an avatar is insulting to the avatar as a concept. Amon never should‚Äôve been able to take an avatar‚Äôs bending. Period. Lok was nothing but plot contrivances meant to deconstruct atla and reinvent the world. Hell the original creators had to leave a list of rules and restrictions because even kataang would have been undone if the shithead behind lok had their way. 

It‚Äôs laughable you call out comics for bad writing but cant even recognize the huge drop in quality from atla to lok. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter what logic you use. Death battles take the characters at their absolute peaks, and use that as a model. Korra at her peak has absolutely no feats that can touch storm at her peak. 

Feats are the only thing that matters when comparing characters for death battles. And korra simpy doesnt have the raw power storm does. She cant control elements on a planetary scale despite having a much smaller planet than earth is. Atla is essentially a dwarf planet, barely larger than a moon. Storm has full control over earth and mars, and doesn‚Äôt even need to be on the planet she is manipulating. How is korra gonna fight storm when she‚Äôs in SPACE raining lightning and tornadoes on her? 

I love the atla universe but they need to stick with battles in their own scope. Storm has participated in battles deciding fates of galaxies and even entire MULTIVERSES. When was the last time an avatar had to fight, much less defeat, a UNIVERSAL threat? The absolute closest they ever got was a planetary threat from vaatu in the form of a dark avatar. Which we already know holds no candle to an omega mutant because korra defeats it. 

I get this is a sub for atla/lok so there‚Äôs gonna be skewed favorism, but this is goku vs superman all over again. Some characters dont belong in death battles, and aside from a handful of characters ever that can touch her, storm is one of these ‚Äúabove a death battle contest‚Äù power levels. 

Storm CANONICALLY defeated wonderwoman in combat. The same wonder woman who has been shown to be near equal to superman in strength. 

You wanna know what crappy writing looks like? How about a PLATINUM MECHA IN A STEAM PUNK ERA? First off its a mecha out of place for the tech levels l. Second, platinum is a brittle metal and would collapse under all that weight. But they backed themselves into a corner with platinum being unbendable (despite sterling silver actually being purer than most platinum, and fully refined metals will be pure enough to unbendable in the first place) 

So the writers literally require suspension of basic reality for a plot contrivance. Thats not good writing, thats lazy, sloppy, and ignorant of their world and the sciences they incorporated into it

Edit: meanwhile specific comic arcs have been rated among some of the best literature ever created ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

The issue you have is that each version of the character stands alone. You should be asking WHICH storm, since over 100 versions exist. Each continuity is its own universe, allowing for retelling of different stories in different ways.

"hk01tdf","&gt;*How is your mutual aid society different from that of voluntary aid here?*

So from the way you've phrased your comment, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm taking ""voluntary aid"" to mean charity. MA and charity may seem similar, but MA is more of a system of organisation that an optional altruistic action. So charity is popping a couple quid into a cup for the homeless or donating an old jumper *(can you tell that I'm British lol)*, whereas MA is working with those around you to meet needs together. I should stress that, obviously, MA is only really an option with the consent of those involved. Be a bit anti-thetical if it was forced on you like.

So for example, I'm planning on starting a food garden in the new year. Getting the know-how to do so now basically. The intent is to try and get my neighbours involved and essentially form a communal food garden, so we all work together to have a free source of fruit and veg to meet our base need there. The equivalent for charity is donating to a food bank. Does that make sense?

&gt;*What prevents mutual aid from existing here trough voluntary action?*

Literally nothing, which is pretty cool of it. The issue is that it's more rooted in Leftism than what you guys typically favour, especially since a big part of it is collective ownership. You seem more informed than the usual dickhead on here, so I'm assuming you haven't just shit yourself at the dropping of the term ""collective ownership"" and started screaming about Stalin. In my experience, the majority of people here will have such a reaction to anything Socialist-esque and will proceed to use a toddler's definition of Socialism and act smart. Kinda makes advocating for it a bit difficult with all that going on.

Also the one AnCap I spoke to who was open to the idea was adamant that the produce should be commodified. The fact that this kinda defeats the purpose of growing food yourself *(or with others of course)* didn't quite connect with them.

&gt;*Do you think there are no altruists here?*

Of course not, that would be woefully lazy and ignorant of me. I just think, and I'm basing this on my experiences here, that helping people meet their base needs isn't a priority; property is. The protection of Private Property seems to take precedent to harm reduction for a lot of AnCaps I've spoken to, which is why I mentioned pants-shitting and screaming of ""Stalin"" earlier. There's obviously been a few people who proudly exclaim that they don't give a shit about others, in a *""got mine""* sense, and it's weird how often they get defended, but it'd be dishonest of me to try and paint the sub like that was the norm.

"hjr1j6k","SS: This is a leader. America needs to find its own Putin, aware of history, aware of how parasites infect a host population, and aware of how to counter it.

&gt;People in the West believe that an aggressive elimination of entire pages from their own history, ‚Äúreverse discrimination‚Äù against the majority in the interests of a minority, and the demand to give up the traditional notions of mother, father, family and even gender, they believe that all of these are the mileposts on the path towards social renewal.

&gt;We have a different viewpoint, We believe that we must rely on our own spiritual values, our historical tradition.

&gt;**After the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks, relying on the dogmas of Marx and Engels**, also said that they would change existing ways and customs and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human morality and the foundations of a healthy society. The destruction of age-old values, religion and relations between people, up to and including the total rejection of family, encouragement to inform on loved ones ‚Äì all this was proclaimed progress and, by the way, was widely supported around the world back then and was quite fashionable, same as today. By the way, the Bolsheviks were absolutely intolerant of opinions other than theirs.

&gt;This, I believe, should call to mind some of what we are witnessing now.

&gt;Looking at what is happening in a number of Western countries, the fight for equality and against discrimination has turned into aggressive dogmatism bordering on absurdity, when the works of the great authors of the past ‚Äì such as Shakespeare ‚Äì are no longer taught at schools or universities, because their ideas are believed to be backward.

&gt;The classics are declared backward and ignorant of the importance of gender or race. In Hollywood memos are distributed about proper storytelling and how many characters of what colour or gender should be in a movie.  Countering acts of racism is a necessary and noble cause, but the new ‚Äòcancel culture‚Äô has turned it into ‚Äòreverse discrimination‚Äô that is, reverse racism. The obsessive emphasis on race is further dividing people, when the real fighters for civil rights dreamed precisely about erasing differences and refusing to divide people by skin colour.

&gt;In a number of Western countries, the debate over men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs rights has turned into a perfect phantasmagoria.

&gt;Zealots of these new approaches even go so far as to want to abolish these concepts altogether. Anyone who dares mention that men and women actually exist, which is a biological fact, risk being ostracised. ‚ÄúParent number one‚Äù and ‚Äúparent number two,‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äôbirthing parent‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmother,‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman milk‚Äù replacing ‚Äúbreastmilk‚Äù because it might upset the people who are unsure about their own gender.

&gt;I repeat, **this is nothing new; in the 1920s**, the so-called Soviet Kulturtraegers also invented some newspeak believing they were creating a new consciousness and changing values that way. And, as I have already said, they made such a mess it still makes one shudder at times.

&gt;Not to mention some truly monstrous things when children are taught from an early age that a boy can easily become a girl and vice versa. That is, the teachers actually impose on them a choice we all supposedly have. They do so while shutting the parents out of the process and forcing the child to make decisions that can upend their entire life. They do not even bother to consult with child psychologists ‚Äì is a child at this age even capable of making a decision of this kind? Calling a spade a spade, this verges on a crime against humanity, and it is being done in the name and under the banner of progress.

&gt;The conservative approach is not about an ignorant traditionalism, a fear of change or a restraining game, much less about withdrawing into our own shell. It is primarily about reliance on a time-tested tradition, the preservation and growth of the population, a realistic assessment of oneself and others, a precise alignment of priorities, a correlation of necessity and possibility, a prudent formulation of goals, and a fundamental rejection of extremism as a method. And frankly, in the impending period of global reconstruction, which may take quite long, with its final design being uncertain, moderate conservatism is the most reasonable line of conduct, as far as I see it. It will inevitably change at some point, but so far, do no harm ‚Äì the guiding principle in medicine ‚Äì seems to be the most rational one. Noli nocere, as they say.

&gt;Again, for us in Russia, these are not some speculative postulates, but lessons from our difficult and sometimes tragic history. The cost of ill-conceived social experiments is sometimes beyond estimation.

"hjn9z3n","&gt;Completely wrong and ignorant of probate law. The estate can't convey until your debts are settled, which means the loans are paid back from asset sales before the basis steps up, which means full capital gains taxes are paid.

You're misunderstanding my point - I am not saying your estate can pay debt tax free at time of your death.  

Let's run a simple example.  I have $10m in stock.  It costs my $1m to fund my lifestyle.  I can borrow that $1m or I can sell my $10m in stock. 

Scenario 1:  I sell my stock.  Because I owe federal, NIIT, and state taxes on capital gains I need to sell $1.3m to have $1m after taxes for spending (30% effective long term capital gains tax).  I am left with a portfolio of $8.7m that grows by 10% to $9.57m next year.

Scenario 2: I take out a $1m loan with 1.5% interest rate.  At the end of the year I owe $1.015m but my investment portfolio is now $11m.  

I die at the end of the year to keep this example simple.  In **Scenario 1 the estate passes along $9.57m** directly to my children.  In scenario 2 my estate will need to sell $1.3195m to cover the loan balance of $1.015m and the taxes associated with capital gains.  In **scenario 2 my estate will pass along the remaining $9.6805m** to my heirs.  Note that although my total taxes paid are higher in scenario 2 it is paid at the END of the year rather than the beginning.  A 300k amount in taxes at the beginning of the year would have appreciated to $330k in the market rather than the $320k I ended up paying at time of death. 

Clearly, it's best to avoid paying capital gains tax and allow your MORE of unsold assets to grow than to actually sell intermittently as you fund your lifestyle.  That's just one year with a $10m starting balance.  Scale that up to billions of dollars across 40-50 years across over 600 people (or tens of thousands of hundred millionaires) and you have a very material amount of capital gains tax avoided due to the ability to consumer using debt.   


&gt;Indeed! Collateralized lending is available to everyone, as is uncollateralized lending in the form of credit cards and student loans. It's hardly a ""billionaire trick"" to get someone to lend you money to pay for your lifestyle consumption, it's just really stupid.

Uncollateralized lending is not viable for consumption as interest rates would be too high.  Collateralized lending works because interest rates just need to be above the federal prime rate for a bank to make money when they know assets can be sold to pay off the principal balance.  Non-wealthy people cannot fund even a middle class lifestyle much less a lavish lifestyle using collateralized.  Someone who has a $500k house with a $250k mortgage and $250k in their 401k would only be able to safely access an annual spend of $3k given that the only have $250k home equity and retirement accounts cannot be margin loaned against.  So that individual needs to trade labor for wages, which are taxed immediately.  A billionaire can side-step income taxes by avoiding labor and consuming via debt given how consumption doesn't scale neatly with net worth.

 

&gt;Well, yes. Because you do have $0 income. Like, you're describing a situation where your income is literally zero dollars.
  

  
Most people would like their income to be a lot higher than zero. That's hardly an enviable position.

You've created a false equivalence.  Lifestyle is only tethered to income if you need to produce labor for funds.  You are dishonestly comparing my hypothetical of a $10m net worth individual having $0 income and 'most people' who rely on wage income to preferring income of higher than zero.  Most people absolutely would prefer to maintain zero income IF they had $10m or more in net worth.",1636265895,"&gt;completely wrong and ignorant of probate law.","wrong and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"wrong and ignorant","wrong",NA,NA,0
"hjn70lr","&gt;	No, the point is you have to die with debt so that your assets get a stepped up basis rather than taxed when transferred to your heirs. 

Completely wrong and ignorant of probate law. The estate can't convey until your debts are settled, which means the loans are paid back from asset sales *before* the basis steps up, which means full capital gains taxes are paid.

&gt;	The bank gets additional 'debt owed', which is a positive balance in their books. 

So is having cash. Obviously banks are in the lending business, but that only works because they get paid back.

It's only a ""debt owed"" *if you're going to pay it back.* If you're never going to pay it back it's an operating loss, not a credit. So it has to be paid back. And it is - from taxable asset sales, either now or at some point in the future.

&gt;	The only 'loser' is the government in the sense that they won't see any taxes from billionaire personal consumption

But they will see taxes, both sales and other excise taxes *and* taxes from capital gains when the assets are sold to pay back the loans, which can't *not* happen.

&gt;	You don't even need to be wealthy to access a form of collateralized lending.

Does shaping the minds of every human being count as power? How are we to compare the shaping of the minds of entire generations of humans to authority in some bureaucracy? Both can be pretty impactful in various ways. Who's to say which one matters most? 

Since all the levels of power matter, are the bureaucracies more populated by women or by men?

What about social and health care? Isn't that a form of power?

How do we disentangle the power of a man and that of his wife? Is there no influence in any way? Has no man ever renounced anything because he knew his wife wouldn't like it?

How about the influence of  women on single men? Has no single man ever used his power to serve women in order to seek to be seen favorably by women? 

Your willingness to dismiss the influence and power of women is disturbing. Women are not infants, unable to decide anything meaningful. They are not flowers pots, unimpactful and ignorant of the world around them, and unable to make their desires and needs heard and taken into considerations.

Feminism didn't invent men caring about women in the 70s, nor did it invent women influencing society.

I'm really curious to know how you determine that men have more power, precisely, to know how you account for things a little more subtle than ""x nbr of men are in this position"".

It's feminists who are so fond of the ""social constructivist"" view of things, many going to the point if denying the influence of biology. Wouldn't that make education the place that holds the most power? The biggest ability to shape society being in the hands of the people who shape people? How do you account for that kind of power in your claim that men hold the most power? If you don't count it, why? How can you reconcile it with the idea that anything is a social construct, and that therefore, the influences you receive when you construct yourself as a person are what makes you who you are?

Here, you're not saying that red is your favourite and yellow is your least favourite. In the same way, ""his and her"" is arbitrary.

It was also a bit of an unnecessarily racially charged example, where other examples would have avoided this.

I think the issue is the word 'or'. Women are often considered 'other' by societies where sexism is ingrained. For the longest time, ""man"" referred to all of humankind, and there is a perception that men and male things are standard and women and female things are non-standard.

When you say ""his or her"" it can be perceived as saying ""his (or her)"". Including 'her' is almost an aside. The sentence functions without 'her', and including 'her' is just some sort of gracious formality, but 'his' is still the main event.

My example of 'ladies and gentlemen' was meant to illustrate that I do not think these attitudes are really embedded in the language at all. The convention *could* have been ""her and his"" and if that had happened we might be having an entirely different discussion.

Of course, now 'ladies and gentlemen' isn't exactly inclusive either. And, come to think of it, neither is 'his and her', since both preclude non-binary people. Whatever OP's employer is trying to do, it is seems really misguided and ignorant of language.

Singular 'they' is clearly the way forward.

"hjaddb9","While I agree the friend made a pretty big error in judgment trying to set you up with her fuck buddy, the reaction to cut her off entirely seems unnecessary. Certainly, something you are free to choose, but not necessary to keep you safe from future poor judgment from her.

I'd certainly cut *him* off entirely. No need for further contact there. Then I'd it make it clear to her that this was not an okay thing to hide from me while she was also trying to connect me with this guy. And that she is not to set me up in the future.

Your friend is obviously going through some shit in her own relationship. She tried to rope you into her own sexual drama. On some level, she probably did honestly believe this great guy would be great for you, but that was probably ore silly and ignorant of her, and not intended as a deliberate betrayal. That is absolutely not cool, but can also absolutely be addressed by one clear conversation and a boundary; I am hurt that you connected me with this guy but kept important information from me about your sexual relationship with him. That was not cool. It felt like a betrayal and makes me question if I can trust you as a friend. If we're going to remain friends, you need to know you don't get to set me up again. Ever.

"hja0t6n","I can provide you with some of those things. Unfortunately, part of the problem is that the majority of climate scientists are not really interested in being climate activists, and so the information in their papers is largely translated to the public via activists and the media. Neither does a great job.

Returning to the issue of scientists not writing for the public, there are not a lot of meta-analyses of scientific papers on how to address climate change that a layperson could comfortably read. It's also not the sort of thing I'm that expert in. I don't really have a particular interest in climate change, and most of what I know is simply from being exposed to high-level conversations about it daily for the better part of my life.

I can, however, easily direct you to the EPA, which has sources for GHG emissions on their website.

[https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

Table ES-3 of the national GHG Inventory from 1990-2018 on page 40 has the information regarding aviation emissions for the United States which I referenced.

[https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf)

Some of the best--at least in terms of readability--climate change coverage I've read comes from the blog Noahpinion. Again, since I don't actively search out climate change information, I rather doubt this is the best source, but I can say I've welcomed his articles which push back against the specious reasoning of many activists while acknowledging the necessity of action.

Sorry I don't have much more to offer, but I can give some general principles that can help you judge any blogs or sources you come across:

* Coal is bad. Anything you can do to kill coal is pretty much a positive. That includes fracking and other techniques that lower the price of natural gas, a much cleaner and (ideally) cheaper fossil fuel. Since many coal-fired power plants can be easily converted to natural gas powered plants, this has a low cost but can reduce emissions from plants by 2/3.
* Climate change is a distinct crisis from other environmentalism. Be wary of people who make climate change their ""priority"" and claim that it will ""destroy the planet/civilization,"" but maintain anti-nuclear positions or other environmental positions which are not focused on reducing GHG emissions above all else. (For the record, climate change will be bad, but much of the first world may not notice anything besides sluggish economic growth and additional natural disasters. It's perfectly acceptable to have other environmental priorities if you embrace this view, but not if you think climate change is an apocalyptic threat).
* Pragmatism. The best climate analyses I've read are all extremely pragmatic. While sweeping changes to society are exciting, they're also difficult. The best solutions are going to be those that accomplish the most at the lowest cost. People who focus on how to make everyday activities such as driving carbon-free, rather than trying to force people to change their lifestyle, are going to accomplish more.
* Technology and economics. Solar panels have exponentially decreased in price over the past few decades. The economic cause of climate change is fundamentally about how the negative externalities of power production are not properly factored into the cost of power. While economists have (unfortunately) been largely unhelpful and ignorant of climate science, this has begun to change in recent years, and many climate scientists stepped up and did the economics on their own. Determining the cost of climate change is critical to determining how much money needs to be spent on it (my rough estimate, probably direct government funding of between 4-40 trillion globally over the next 50 years). Knowing a lot about all the different developing technologies is similarly critical, since ultimately a decision must be made about which to use and when. RealEngineering on YouTube has a series of decent videos discussing the technological side of climate change which, as an engineer, I can vouch for.
* Politics is necessary, but be wary of becoming political. Generally, look for people who are policies-focused. While party-preference is fine, and acknowledgement of some parties' or politicians' intractability is good, the best commenters on climate change look for the political solutions which have the broadest support and the most effect. This is in some sense an amalgamation of all my previous principles, but also the most important one. The main reason climate change remains an issue is because the world lacks the political will to solve it. We have the power to do so, but many feel the costs are too high. Convincing these people that they are wrong--or even that the risks of them being wrong are too high to countenance--is perhaps the greatest challenge in addressing climate change. Largely, I recommend doing so by showing how little truly needs to change to solve climate change, though many reasonable people disagree on this.",1636031768,"while economists have (unfortunately) been largely unhelpful and ignorant of climate science, this has begun to change in recent years, and many climate scientists stepped up and did the economics on their own.","unhelpful and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"largely unhelpful and ignorant","unhelpful",NA,"largely",0

"hj9sd9s","I‚Äôm sorry but what are you two talking about??? 

The book is literally titled ‚ÄúGenji Monogatari.‚Äù The English translation being ‚ÄúA Tale of Genji‚Äù is erroneous at best because the book is about several ‚ÄúGenjis‚Äù (singular and plural nouns are not differentiated as a matter of course in Japanese). That clues us into what the story is about. 

The book, while certainly written by a woman for a mainly woman audience, is not centered around the women in the book. They are conquests for the multiple Genji characters. And as messed up as it sounds, many audience members probably self-inserted themselves into the novel because the idea of a ‚ÄúShining Prince Genji‚Äù who was handsome, smart, rich, and ignorant of boundaries (as were most men at the time, but the OG Genji was just more so, which made him even sexier somehow) was enticing to them like the ancient equivalent of 50 Shades of Gray. 

I personally would not list this book as a piece of feminist literature. It just feels gross to say it. OG Genji literally grooms a child named Murasaki (self-insert, perhaps?), rapes her at a young age (even her ladies in waiting objected because of how young she was), and makes her his ‚Äúmain‚Äù wife. But even she‚Äôs just a surrogate for Fujitsubo who is a surrogate for his dead mother that he strangely wants to bang because he had to grow up without her and that messed up his psyche. 

I‚Äôm rambling now, but if self-insert anime fanfiction with pedophilia and overly rapey male protagonists is feminist literature, then fine I guess. I just don‚Äôt agree. 

A think if you‚Äôre looking for a feminist book from that same era you should read ‚ÄúThe Pillow Book‚Äù or ‚ÄúMakura no Soushi‚Äù by Sei Shounagon.

"hj8x3cp","I find this to be a very unhelpful sentiment, and at the risk of being overly blunt, both self-righteous and ignorant of the culture that accompanies the Hindi language:

1. I HAVE been *actually* studying Hindi. Lessons every day, and practice with my husband and extended family. You don't get to gatekeep what constitutes ""actual study"". If daily lessons with the mentorship of native speakers isn't ""actual"" learning, then WTF is? 

2. I'm not ""grinding pointlessly"". I do what I have time for, which is why it's taken me this long. I'm not going to feel bad about myself for studying everyday because I didn't study *enough* everyday to meet the standards of random people on the internet. 

3. Duolingo *has* gotten me somewhere ‚Äî I'm beginning to be able to pick up conversations among my family members, which is my goal. The purpose of the Duo Hindi course is to teach people to read the devanagari script and understand the grammatical structure. Once I've got that down, building my vocabulary through flash cards will be quick business. Pronunciation will take more work... I'll probably need a coach to get my tongue around those bananas (for an English speaker) sounds. However, what I've learned through Duo has given me the confidence to begin learning through other sources.

4a. Useful phrases in Hindi ‚Äî from a non-Indian viewpoint ‚Äî are less useful in Hindi, because in India they often just use the English words / phrases and saying them in Hindi would sound weird. Hindi is the official language of India, but it's not spoken by everyone in India (mostly people in North-Central India are Hindi speakers, I believe). When the British left, the Indian government removed English from communications entirely. However, they found that English had become the universal albeit unofficial second language of many people in India. That meant that no matter what your first language was, you could get by with English. In Mumbai (where Hindi is *not* the local language), my husband and his friend group all had different first languages. They communicated in English, because it was what they all understood.

4b. This brings us to ""Hinglish"", which is common in many places in India, and probably what my husband speaks these days if we're honest about it. Even my mother in law who ""doesn't speak English"" can get by on Hinglish. When I go to India, the areas where I visit will most likely understand Hinglish, and I'll be able to communicate decently (if I can get my pronunciations right). 

Most importantly, we all have our own personal reasons for learning a language. Some people might want to be linguists, or achieve perfect fluency in multiple languages, or teach in a foreign language at a university. Good on anyone who has these goals.

*My* goal is to show my parents in law that I value them and will strive to embrace certain aspects of their culture and pass them on (my husband can't be trusted with this ‚Äî he's ""whiter"" than I am). My goal is to study with consistency and no excuses. My goal is to be part of a bilingual family where my children don't have to switch into pure English the moment I enter the room, and don't feel ""different"" from me, even though we won't look the same. 

IMHO, while slow, I'm working toward these goals at a pace that will get me where I need to be at the right time.

Yeah, because they were not smart enough, whether in hard rules or soft rules, to not be stolen from

For example when a large company is hacked and had data stolen from them they deserved it. Because they SHOULD suffer the PR nightmare of having the data stolen so that they understand the value of other people's privacy.

Honor among thieves is to break your system and take a little bit, like a tax, but not to actually harm and destitute you.

Now I know you might be thinking ‚Äòbut we are smarter now so our models shouldn‚Äôt change‚Äô ,how do you think people in the 1500‚Äôs felt, or the 1600‚Äôs or any years after that, at the time that any theory is made it is suitable and understandable for the current time period, however so far throughout the entirety of history the common trend has being of humans being wrong and theories changing so it is very likely that trend will continue. 

Also have you ever thought about the universe not even having any rules or laws? Maybe stuff just happens randomly and there are no true laws, humans might have just being finding these patterns that don‚Äôt exist which btw is something very common in human behaviour. And your argument could be ‚Äòbut things have being the same for 1000‚Äôs of years, well sure but in the scale of the universe that is truly nothing, the dinosaurs existed for 1,000 times longer than humans have and that was still just a fraction of the earth‚Äôs life which is just a small fraction of the universe‚Äôs life. 
Either way that argument is kinda pointless so I‚Äôm gonna end it there.

We know the Big Bang had enough energy to make them all isn‚Äôt answer or even an argument, Christians know that their god had the power to create them all too does that prove their religion? No. And yes we ‚Äòknow‚Äô the Big Bang happened, simply because of CMB but I mean that really just proves there was a big explosion with the power to create the universe, for all we know that could be the amount of power a black hole releases when something happens to it, because we don‚Äôt actually know for certain that black holes don‚Äôt just explode, we have a theory thanks to hawking but that isn‚Äôt proof, not to mention the theory states they will slowly radiate away but considering that they are a literal breakage in spacetime there is no definite way to know they continue radiating away and something else doesn‚Äôt happen. Not to mention the fact that we have no clue what came before the Big Bang, if anything did, and why the Big Bang occurred so the theory of the Big Bang really brings more questions then answers.

How do you know there would be an indicator of god, for all we know he is the one that controls every aspect of this universe, why are you imagining he is just sitting somewhere and just sometimes popping in, also with the power god supposedly possess he would be able to literally recreate the entire universe after visiting he could come down talk to someone and then recreate the entire universe except with the event of him coming down being removed and it‚Äôs actions still occuring, hell he could physically make anything happen, as well as make the things that make that thing happen, happen and so on. By no means does god‚Äôs actions need to have any traceable effect on the world, maybe he even does he just alters everyone‚Äôs thoughts to make them think he doesn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt forget god suppsodely created everything including you more or less. This is a big reason i lack belief of any god because this seems stupid, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs untrue and my word isn‚Äôt going to disprove it.

"hidi243","""pretty much the title"" only works when the title is completely clear on it's own without explanation :)

I'm going to try to respond to your post as best as I can interpret.  Paragraph one is about being right, the truth, belief, acceptance. It's also about an auto-measurement or self-imposed scale of the accuracy or correct-ness of being.

The 2nd is asking about the definitions of these words and how they relate to the previous. I can see the how objective and the subjective clashing here are probably what you mean by torture. This is how I am going to frame your question.  I am only going to try to answer one part of it; what is science?

Science was born from religion.  Where people had questions about the nature of the world, observable phenomenon, the cause of things. There was a need for humans to de-mystify their world. 

Science is fundamentally different from belief systems by that it admits that it is reaching for an explanation which it doesn't know if it's right or not. It proposes an explanation and then tries to measure the confidence it has with it. This is the birth of critical thinking: having an explanation, and then assessing that explanation for confidence. 

&gt; Rain comes from the sky, but only when it's cloudy. More cloud, darker cloud, heavier cloud are related to more rain. 

With a statement of explanation, or a 'hypothesis', we can further investigate *how* confident we are with it. It may be a rare event but sun-showers happen. This goes against the hypothesis certainly, or it may open up this scale of more cloud =&gt; more rain to also include less cloud =&gt; less likely rain, or even rain =&gt; cloud. This type of documented self criticism is supposed to be available to anyone who would like to weigh in on the argument. As a group we can chip away at the issue until we have proposed a model that seems to fit almost precisely to what we are experiencing in the physical world. For the rain example, this is meteorology and how we attempt to predict the weather; an on-going science since it was ever proposed: what brings the rain?

Science has a few simple rules to follow in order to stay focused on finding the truth, or at least the closest thing to it. The [scientific method](https://dosits.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The_Scientific_Method_2.png). I like to explain these in more childish ways.

1. write it down. If you don't write it down then it's not science. You can't keep a mental journal of events and then use this to explain anything to anyone other than yourself.  Which is Anecdotal Evidence and/or Confirmational Bias. Science recognises that these things are not pushing for the truth, they are trying to preserve belief.  So, simply by writing it all down we can help to avoid it.

Each hypothesis is experimented with *to prove it is wrong*. We build a house of cards as an explanation, boast about it's strength, then we throw stones at our own creation or invite others to throw stones at it to topple it. The house of cards needs to be able to withstand criticism on it's own with no additional help.  How well it stands, or how easy it crumbles, is an indication of how accurate it *might* be. When we test, we are testing for instability, not stability. We're trying to break our own model. We invite others to break it.

Reporting is explaining how it was broken, how easily it was broken, and attempting to explain why that was the case. Although the card-house was strong against wind attacks from multiple directions, it collapsed in on itself easily when a small mass was placed gently on one of the supporting cards.   Using the data from the failure we can circle back and do it all again, but trying to be more accurate, trying to fail less. 

This is counter intuitive to belief systems which start with an explanation and then set about to solidify that explanation to defeat attempts to challenge it. Belief systems protect the core reasoning with abstract arguments.  Science keeps changing the core reasoning until it becomes self-sufficient in countering argument. Great example of this is the sun. People died over this.

Today we may take it for granted that the sun is the centre of our solar system, the Earth being one of many planets circling it, but this wasn't always the case. The church, at the time, in an effort to solidify it's position in modern society and to deny any power in heretic religions such as sun worship refused to acknowledge that the sun could be at the centre. While scientists had modelled the solar system with the Earth as the centre, it simply would not hold up to criticism. Changing the model to suggest the sun at centre simply made many of the flawed arguments about the former model inconsequential. It was the better model to explain the physical world.  Forwarding on to today we know that neither the sun nor Earth are the true centre of the system, the model has been adjusted again. This self-crit, self-asses, gives us the ability to find a more and more accurate truth, more confidence with the explanation, a better model, a model that better predicts what will happen in the world, and a model that helps explain what happens in the world.  100 years from now our modelling of space and solar systems and gravity will be more accurate than it is today.  Or, our current best model explaining things will be shown to be inaccurate. 

like math, science is universal. It works regardless of the language used, the culture, or the technology.  These things can only speed or retard the growth of science. If we were to meet with an alien civilization it would come as no surprise to discover that the vast majority of our science matches up perfectly, because we're not writing elaborate explanations of everything, we're discovering them and writing them down.

Is Science vs Religion a real thing? It appears to be, but it shouldn't be, it makes no sense. Science and Religion only clash when they differ in how each explains phenomena.  Science is looking for a better explanation, while religion refuses to alter it's core interpretation and finds other ways to keep that explanation valid. As much as the media might have us think that this is a brutal and ongoing war, it isn't. It was, once; but that age is well and truly past. Science has no interest in religion, nor any belief system. These things go against the principles of what science is: we don't know (why) and we want to know (why). Science measures the strength of itself with confidence and probability. Religion uses faith. The core of science is that we are in the dark and ignorant of the truth of the universe, we seek to illuminate our position.  The core of any belief system is that there exists a pure beacon to follow and we must overcome obstacles to get closer to it.  When you think about it, these two are almost saying the same thing. Reminder; science was born from religion.  They were once one and the same.

Why should I trust science?  Just like how you might trust OpenSource software over propriety, even if you yourself can't comprehend the elaborate explanation of the inner workings, you can trust others from the community who *do* understand these texts to interpret them to you. This should sound very familiar. The difference is only that the interpretations are consistent. Any false interpretation can be detected by any one from the community. There is no central mystical source of what is and is not correct, it's all right there for you to see for yourself, you may need to spend some time catching up on your education in order to do so, but you're welcome to do that - it's not a barrier put in place to prevent you from challenging the texts, it's a barrier only in your education and ability to comprehend.  You're not an expert, or maybe you are.

Is science OpenSource Religion‚Ñ¢ ? :  lol, no. Mostly because it doesn't need to be. We don't need to put a ceremonial robe on science or to worship it's authority. Science is the truth of things as best as can be given the current circumstances.  Truth is the authority. 

But, science gets it wrong sometimes! Yes.  Getting it wrong is the bread and butter of science. This isn't a criticism, like, at all. Remember the fundamental principles. If you want to 'insult' science it would be better to say ""science sometimes gets it perfectly right without even trying!""  That's a burn, right there. I would be offended if someone said that to me, and I would follow up with recalling all of the times I had been wrong. Another burn could be: ""[We now know everything, it's complete and we can close the book on it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707092/)"" 

Science can't explain everything!  - yet. Knowledge is now a factor of time, just wait a few minutes and knowledge gets bigger.

Does everyone need to get onboard and believe this new truth regime of science? Science works hard to deliver peer reviewed, documentable explanations and evidence. The findings of science are the product of the arguments, fights, challenges, testing, review, repeating. If you would like to challenge the findings, please do but be appropriate with it, we'll even give you the tools to do so.  When someone takes a finding and simply asserts that it's wrong it throws all of that work back into the faces of thousands and thousands of people who worked hard to already try to shake and disprove the findings. If someone thinks  that they can disprove a finding better, go right ahead and show your working. Science isn't an opinion. When it seems like this is untrue it's because the model is in need of an update.

South Africa is still quite segregated (economically and racially), and because of the various affects of Apartheid and inability to address issues since the 90's, crime is very concentrated in specific areas, and even \*extremely rare\* in others.

That is fear-mongering. Cape Town is labelled the crime capital of the world, but only because of the gangs - gangs only operate in certain areas, and as long as you don't go into those areas (which, as a tourist, you likely wont), you don't have to worry about them.

\[...\]Dom Pedro II (2 December 1825 ‚Äì 5 December 1891), nicknamed ""the Magnanimous"",\[1\] was the second and last monarch of the Empire of Brazil, reigning for over 58 years

Pedro II inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, but he turned Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth, and form of government‚Äîa functional representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in the Platine War, the Uruguayan War, and the Paraguayan War, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture, and the sciences, and he won the respect and admiration of people such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women's rights.\[211\] On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook.\[212\] He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.\[213\] Because of his increasing ""indifference towards the fate of the regime"" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the ""prime, perhaps sole, responsibility"" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.\[214\]\[215\] 

By June 1887, the Emperor's health had considerably worsened and his personal doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment.\[221\] While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed.\[222\] While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil.\[223\] With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, ""Great people! Great people!""\[224\] Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888.\[225\]\[226\] The ""whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration.""\[227\] With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the monarchy seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.\[228\]
  

  
\[231\] The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country.\[232\] Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces.\[233\] The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.\[234\]\[235\]  
Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy.\[236\]\[237\] They launched a coup d'√©tat, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889.\[238\] The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion.\[239\]\[240\] Historian L√≠dia Besouchet noted that ""\[r\]arely has a revolution been so minor.""\[241\] During the ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome.\[242\] He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward.\[243\] When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: ""If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.""\[244\] He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.\[245\]

Although he managed to remain calm and composed during the events of November 14th through 16th, D. Pedro II surely felt a deep sadness because of the exile from his homeland.\[64\] Pedro II wrote a heartfelt message of farewell to the Brazilian people that expressed no ill-will toward the new government. He wrote: ‚ÄúAbsenting myself, then, I, with all the members of my family, will cherish for Brazil the deepest, most yearning remembrance, while praying earnestly for its greatness and prosperity‚Äù\[65\].

.\[68\] Towards the new regime, ‚Äúhis attitude \[‚Ä¶\] was kindly but patronizing and, in many respects, paternal‚Äù\[69\]. In later years, Pedro II remarked on his hope for a republican government in Brazil: ‚ÄúI should have desired \[‚Ä¶\] that the civilization of Brazil had made possible the immediate admission of the republican system, which, to me, is the most perfect possible in human affairs‚Ä¶I wanted only to contribute towards a social state in which the republic could be ‚Äòplanted,‚Äô so to speak by me, and could bring forth fruit in proper season‚Äù \[70\].  In his diary, he similarly wrote that he would have been a republican, had he judged Brazil advanced enough for a republican government (‚Äú\[‚Ä¶\] ) \[71\]. D. Pedro feared that Brazil, if democratically governed, would fall to military dictatorship like other Latin American republics since the masses were uneducated and ignorant of democratic ideals.

\[72\] In regard to the new Constitution, Pedro found it lacking in protection of electoral rights and less fitted to the ‚Äútemperament of the Latin race‚Äù than the Constitution under the Monarchy
  



  
The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end‚Äîhe was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises.

Pedro's last couple of years were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil.\[248\] He never supported a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire ""to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort.""\[249\] One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia.\[250\]\[251\] Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family.\[252\] His last words were ""May God grant me these last wishes‚Äîpeace and prosperity for Brazil"".\[253\] While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: ""It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland.""\[254\]\[...\]

"hi5jopt","Your Kind of taking compassion to such an extreme length that it fails to be compassion anymore. It‚Äôs more about your extreme judgement that affecting anything at all throughout your course of life is antithetical to compassion. That in order to truly be compassion we must all exist in our own self contained bubbles and not interact with each other. Eating Food is but one of the ways we interact with our conscious reality. To take you extreme definition to the very limits would be zero interaction at all for the preservation of all the consciousness in the universe, everything allowed to be as it is forever. Like a cosmic museum. 

Not only would this be boring if this were the goal of enlightenment/compassion, no teacher would ever teach, no story would ever be told to another, no meal would be eaten or made up, nothing could be done for it is the interaction between all things that creates all things as they are continuously changing. Your extreme of compassion though focused on what you eat, could logically be taken to such extremes that it‚Äôs compassion without interaction. 

I‚Äôll stay in my corner you stay in yours and we‚Äôll never have that boxing match which gives everyone a little entertainment. No extreme compassion dictates we‚Äôre not even allowed to converse let alone hit each other for sport.

I eat food meat included cause I enjoy it and I compassionately and gratefully thank this interactive universe for taking billions of years to create an experience where I can sit down and eat a steak fresh from the grill. That took not months or years to create that took billions and if you release judgement about which foods are right and which are wrong you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs completely fine for the universe to want to experience eating a steak. Evolution is a microscopic idea compared to the divine planning that went into creating humans that create this entire reality. Billions of years of compassion and hard work from entities above and below every spectrum all interacting with each other, some doing ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing some doing ‚Äúgood‚Äù things, the compassionate universe does not judge.

Compassion is not about right or wrong, or not changing anything or not allowing oneself to change anything. That angle is extreme mercy to the point of being an ineffectual, you‚Äôll get rolled over by a strong wind with that attitude and it will be your own fault. 

True compassion is allowing things to be as they are: ever changing. Accepting that if you trod on a snail or ate some chicken that that is as natural as a star being absorbed by a black hole or a lion eating a zebra. Any and all are an act within consciousness, an act of God and it makes little sense refusing to act in the name of self preservation or compassion to this extreme. Why so serious? Eat some food consider that your food enjoys being eaten just as much as you enjoy eating it.

Imagine this, consciousness is in the process of dying and reincarnating all the time as is energy.

So a Cow, lives it‚Äôs life composed of billions of bio organism that themselves are composed of energy, muscles and shit I don‚Äôt really know the ingredients of a cow coz I never check the instructions but the cow is energy it‚Äôs also got a consciousness that is cow.

When the cow dies is broken down into its constituent parts and transformed into a burger that cows consciousness is no longer there, that cow is probably reincarnated into another cow already. 

The constituent parts that make up the mince that become a burger, that consciousness thats more like a compilation of different consciousness, it‚Äôs the same energy from parts of the cow now recreated in a different form: a burger.

That burger so created by man has no other purpose than to be eaten. 
It‚Äôs like sausage party, it‚Äôs literally chilling in the packet waiting to be taken home by the gods.

Now that movie for comedic effect makes sense it seem like the food is terrified and ignorant of being eaten but consciousness at this level is probably blissed out or at the very least responds to the consciousness of the people around it. 

Human consciousness is the active consciousness in most situations here on earth. Human consciousness creates this reality and if you‚Äôll experiment with this, you can change how your food tastes with your consciousness.

I did this with wraps from a meal deal, you can take the food hold it in your hands and feel gratitude before you eat it. It‚Äôs tastes slightly better as the food responds to your consciousness. Just try it. 

get around your problem either by understanding how consciousness really works at the level of our food or letting go of such an extreme definition of compassion. Nobody‚Äôs asking you to limit yourself the universe is crazy abundant but if you limit your experience because you don‚Äôt want to step on any body else‚Äôs toes you‚Äôll only make us all bereft of the change you could have had on the world, first things first you got to eat unless you‚Äôve figured out how to get energy from inside like I have then you only eat coz you enjoy it üòâ",1635276862,"now that movie for comedic effect makes sense it seem like the food is terrified and ignorant of being eaten but consciousness at this level is probably blissed out or at the very least responds to the consciousness of the people around it.","terrified and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"terrified and ignorant","terrified",NA,NA,0

But!! i do believe in clean clothes, clean shoes. 
I also enjoy two luxury things every single day - expensive perfume and expensive coffee (with cream, hold the sugar and milk). 
I work out every day. 
I shower every day. 
I read every day (religion, climate change, gender studies, manners, etiquette, nutrition, etc). 

I am so different from the people around me, they are loud, rude, vulgar and ignorant of so much but brave about their opinions. If i wanted to be attractive to them, id have to change so much of myself.

There are ideas you have - develop them.

Most of Africa didn't have independence until 1960 and many of them still don't. Why didn't they have independence? Capitalist imperialists. Many of these independence movements were destroyed by capitalists for the express purpose of \*preventing liberal democracy in order to maintain wealth extraction for capitalists\*. Not even fighting socialism, but literally preventing the system they benefited from so they could steal more.

"hhlxk2c","&gt;The research available seems to make it clear that 2 biological parents raising children in the same household is the best environment for the overall health and wellbeing of the child

\[citation needed\]

Also, this is extremely heteronormative, and ignorant of the fact that non-biological parents generally have to be assessed extensively in order to be considered able to foster/adopt, whereas biological parents can have as many kids as they like regardless of their ability.

&gt;But when there is less incentive to get married and stay married, the result is that we statistically produce weaker, smaller, and/or less families.

\[citation needed\]

Also, marriage is not necessary for a nuclear family and vice versa.

&gt;This is important because we need strong and plentiful families to prevent things like aging population which spell long term disaster for the very welfare systems we implement to replace things like the former roles of the family.

I hate to break it to you, but the population will continue to age with or without families. In fact, surely fewer families will lessen the aging population in future? Unless you mean that more children need to be born to support the already living adults, which sounds like a ponzi scheme.

Governments absolutely should be helping those who need it; that is the point of governments. Relying on families to support the elderly can quite often be socially, financially and physically to the carers, especially if they have no outside support.

&gt;It's noticeable that marriage, and even more so religion namely Christianity in the West, tend to spell out the strength of a nation's families, and vice versa. But these seem to be very much at odds with the agendas of much of feminist politics.

The position of feminist politics is that women should have the freedom to decide what they want to do with their lives and with who, if anyone, they wish to spend it. Traditional marriage and the nuclear family are not bad things to have in and of themselves, but nobody should feel compelled towards them just because it was the norm in the past.

Civil marriage is essentially a legal contract between two people for their mutual benefit. It may have more meaning to some people, but you can have the pomp and the promises without the legal instrument and vice versa. If a relationship is not working out, you generally should not remain in it. I believe that even if you have children, it's better for them if their parents split up rather than remain in a degrading relationship.

"hhjrafi","Chivalry used to be an expression of courtship when men would try to win a woman's heart by acts of gallantry to try and impress her with their value. Acts such as holding doors, carrying things for her or any other ""act of service"" was done by men to literally demonstrate to a woman his usefulness to her. It was men's way of communicating not just interest but a little subconscious way of saying *""I like you and I want to be of service to you, please give me your affection.""* How the fuck was this intention ever perverted by feminists to mean *""I want to own you by being of service to you""* I will never understand. Chivalry is nothing but glorified simping if we are going to be brutally honest here.

**Women have always been considered to have the ultimate power to turn down any man's clumsy advances** [as this quaint 100 year old film demonstrates](https://youtu.be/AufisRXoV5Y). Here you see two rich men attempting to take advantage of a servant girl - she promptly rejects them *without scorn*, and thus the focus of the comedy is the two men who are thus supposed to be considered the buffoons of the film who have to do all their own cleaning like dolts because they offended the girl who was cleaning for them. 

100 years ago watching these men fumble around trying to do ""Women's Work"" was supposed to send a message that ""women's work"" is still work, that women should be respected for their labor because even when men get down to doing it **it is not easy**. Hence the clumsy fumbling around. Today instead of acknowledging this productive point of view to get men to respect what women do instead feminists have undermined the whole damned thing by inventing this bullshit of *""feigned incompetence""* where they would instead accuse these fumbling men of intentionally being incompetent in order to get the women to do the work. The feminists that push this narrative of *""feigned incompetence""* are so utterly stupid and ignorant of history that they don't even realize that *feigned incompetence* is what women historically do in order to allow for a man to approach her. 

The classic [dropped handkerchief](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/73232589_100839748029597_2079809214116528128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=973b4a&amp;_nc_ohc=JvwiGD7F_-oAX97rMQt&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&amp;oh=f3cb6df4c8e59ec3c54bd45b7d61e2e7&amp;oe=6197B38D) device where a woman intentionally creates a very minor scene in where a man can swoop in to give her a service, such as picking up her handkerchief for her. More practically women feign incompetence all the time in order to attract a man who feels it's his chance to swoop in and be useful and thus get her attention. Today it is in the form of acting helpless or incompetent from pretending a task is too complicated for her that she needs a mans advice or pretending like a box is too heavy for her to lift. Turning around and claiming it is men who feign incompetence in order to get women to do the work is just completely fucking stupid considering, first of all, that such a man would probably feel very emasculated if he requires that a woman take care of his ass like she was his momma. That is just not the way men think. This is how I know for damned sure that feminists are utterly stupid and just making shit up or more often just projecting their own shit unto men as in this case, because they have zero self awareness. 

&gt;Chivalry is when a man specifically helps a woman specifically, and he wouldn't even glance at a fellow man who needs help.""

No. Chivalry used to - key words: *used to* \- be when men would **give a very specific woman very specific attention that he would not give to any other woman**. It was also when men used to extend women a certain special courtesy on the condition of their womanhood, such as not being crass or blunt in front of women and keeping the less savory aspects of their behavior in check when in front of a lady. Nowadays there is zero reason for men to walk on eggshells in front of women because women are free to walk away if a guy is being an ass or too vulgar for her taste. 

As for those old men did it ever occur to you that they are just insecure about their age more than their gender? Old dudes say the same shit to me whenever I try to help them and I am a man, in fact even most old ladies. In today's culture it is considered polite to refuse help because those who are too eager to get help can give off freeloader vibes. 

Also, the refusal for help in women's case is sometimes a shit test. Women will refuse a man's help just to test him to see if he is really going to help her or just shrug and walk away. The only ones who got this song and dance right are older ladies. Whenever I help older women with anything they never give me any bullshit about it, instead they show gratitude and thanks as soon as I give them any help. 

It is only younger women who socially awkward goons these days, on par with men, and who can't decide on whether to refuse help just to be polite or accept a man's help and risk giving off the wrong signal that she is interested in more than just being helped or if she should truly refuse all help just to assert her *""I don't need to man""* status.

"hh86fof","Of course I'm thinking purely through numbers and stats; we're discussing balance. OP is asking why the monk is considered underpowered which means they're asking about numbers and stats. 

RP isn't able to be balanced as you mentioned here, so discussing it is moot. All classes have loads of way to be RP'ed and RP is always dependent on the player so WoC cannot really balance around it outside of maybe providing some ribbon abilities to RP around. 

While the game obviously has an RP focus to disregard the numbers and stats is, in my opinion, very short-sighted and ignorant of the way people play the game. Many people, even in DnD, do not want to be playing a character that feels a lot worse than their teammates when it comes to damage output, combat usefulness, etc. This is what is being discussed here, the shortfallings Monk has that can make the class mechanically weaker than the other martials without the DM setting up specific opportunities for it to shine. 

I apologise if I sound confrontational, but I don't really see why balance has to be disregarded just because there is also RP. If the classes were more balanced in regards to numbers and stats you can RP just as well as you always have, and balancing the Monk class changes nothing in regards to RP.

There was follow up - it led to a shadow war between the Space Wolves and the Inquisition/Grey Knights for a period of about 8 months to a year. The Grey Knights refer to this period as ""The Months of Shame,"" it's detailed in their codex, the Wolves codex, and forms a big chunk of the novel _The Emperor's Gift_. 

In essence, the Lord Inquisitor who directed the purge in the first place gets a bug up his ass about the Space Wolves, forces the Grey Knights to start going after the Space Wolves ships, even when they weren't putting themselves between the Inquisition and the Guard, culminating in the Inquisitor going literally crazy that a first founding chapter wasn't dropping everything to do what he wanted. He amassed a fleet, went into orbit around Fenris, made some very bellicose statements, and promptly got his head chopped off when Logan Grimnar teleported onto his command deck. Bjorn the Fell Handed was woken up to mediate the dispute after that, and everyone basically just picked up their ball and went home. 

Also, it's worth noting that the Warhammer wiki has this to say about the ""probably chaos infected guard"":

My husband is not cruel or malicious. I know he doesn't purposely hurt me. He constantly tells me he loves and and we hold hands often. He is a kind man. He listens to my trauma and assures me that it was abuse. He has never insulted me, never passive aggressive, never raised his voice at me etc.

You could write, in gigabytes, the entire drive size of the SSD every single day for five years straight in most SSDs (exempting the ones that are lost early on to the bathtub curve) and it still work.

Look for a drive's ""Drive Writes Per Day"" or ""Terabytes Written"" statistic to find out exactly how resilient they are. 

&gt; DWPD measures how many times a user can rewrite an entire SSD every day throughout its warrantied lifetime.

&gt;You mean when Israel tried to illegally import weapons of war after threating Jordan and Syria, and after genociding Palestinians (the Palestinian Exodus)?  
&gt;  
&gt;The only thing Egypt did was block illegal weapons trafficking, and as a result Israel tried killing everyone, then occupied their land.

So, slavery? People actually do have the human right to recompense.

They get to create it, you can choose to consume it or not. Why are you deserving of content free of advertising and they are not deserving of compensation for that work?

&gt;I didn't say they weren't allowed. I said that the way many of them pull it off is bullshit. 

Sorry, but calling it unethical and scummy sounds like you don't want it allowed. Who has an ethical complaint and then does nothing about it? Either admit to it or admit to the fact you overexaggerated your position, just don't try to obfuscate the point.

&gt;How about people who's livelihood is on the robot calls asking about your cars extended warranty? Don't they deserve a living? Yeah, they're people, so it's nice if they are supported, but the way they accomplish it....is BS

Yeah, they deserve a living, the calls aren't bullshit or unethical even if they are annoying. 

How would you suggest they be allowed to financially support themselves? And again, why is this method bullshit other than you find it inconveniencing? You still do not provide a justification.

Just because you can solve Maas Waveforms doesn't' mean you are generally intelligent even though only mathematical geniuses can solve such things.

I think capitalism essentially is the modern form of slavery where instead of ships and shackles fiat is used to control people and the manipulation is much more subtle. The reason is that there are too many apes and if apes really knew they were slaves then they would revolt and fight back(and this is why robotics is so dangerous as they will end up being used as slave drivers by the elites rather than being used ""slaves"" themselves to empower humanity).

Basically the elites have to balance keeping us as enslave as possible without cluing us in and without overdoing it and setting us off. I think they are losing this battle. Also, the elites is a vague category that involves old and new money and it more is a lose cabal of psychopaths who just want as much power as they can get and then they surround themselves with a bunch of sociopaths who will do their bidding for $$$.

I think a lot of slaves are becoming aware due to the information age and those around 40 years of age sort of have a dual view of how it was vs how it's going. The younger generations know it sucks but don't have a reference point(although they will when they get older). People around 40 also have been able to take advantage of the massive information(if they chose to) and so have much broader context than anyone else. The boomers are generally clueless and simply want to retain their comfortable life styles(the ones who are well off at least) and keep the status quo. For them it's usually just politicians and either the dems or repubs are the problem and it's no actually complicated. They also generally believe capitalism is good and works and that people living under bridges are just lazy. They also generally believe rich people work very hard for their money. Of course their belief system, while in their time not as obviously insane as it is now, has lead to what we have now.

So there is this massive dynamic that is taking place that the very fabric of humanity is being pulled apart. WE used to be unified in our ignorance and locally but things have changed so quick due to science and tech that it's literally pulling the fabric of our realty apart. I believe this is causing massive psychological problems in humanity that almost no one really understands but many people are ""feeling it"" to various degree's. I think it's quite complex and due to many reasons(not just tech but the enslavement due to greed, the lack of wealth to actually survive(e.g., because of health care costs, exercise, etc), the integration of all of societies(which is causing friction in many ways), etc. But we are at the point where humanity, in the global sense, is just starting to have to deal with these problems and they no longer can be swept under the rug.

This wouldn't be so bad IF our ""leaders"" were not the most insane and ignorant of humanity.... but they effectively are. So I expect things to be much worse before they get better, if they get better(for all of us, rather than Bezos, Musk, and the rest of the elites). Another major problem is that most of the slaves are still quite ignorant and greedy themselves(they are no different than the elites... same psychological problems except they are poor. If you give them wealth they will end up being just like wealthy people are now).

"hg8t2a5","I think a large percentage of the blame, not all, rests on policies advocated, implemented and administered by big government progressives. The Great Society programs in the 60s began the process of replacing the need for a working father with a government check. The Crime Bill of the 90s sponsored by Joe Biden and signed by Bill Clinton imposed mandatory minimums on prison sentences for drug crimes and was prosecuted at much higher rate against black men. Prosecutors like Kamala Harris locked up a generation of mostly black men for low level drug crimes. Look at the proliferation of abortion clinics in poor, urban areas. In NYC the rate of black abortions outnumber black births. Add to this the ""all or nothing"" style social safety net that cuts off benefits and assistance as soon to you begin to help yourself leading many to choose not to work because the government help is a better income. 

All of these issues and factors cumulatively have created a perfect storm which is resulted in a multi-generational problem that we face today. It's totally fair to argue about current policies and what to do about them and certainly fair to be critical of both more liberal and more conservative policymakers and thinkers when trying to figure out a tenable solution. However the original question posted asking if it was fair to blame conservatives for for this problem is in my opinion disingenuous and ignorant of modern political history.  People on the left using fingerpointing and calling the other side racist makes for good memes on Twitter and headlines on CNN but ultimately it doesn't solve any problem for anybody that they claim to care about. The biggest problem at the conservatives have is the perception that they are at best apathetic to the problems in the black community and at worse actively work against solutions due to racial or ethnic differences. This like many other issues has devolved into political tribalism with both sides just throwing insults and false accusations rather than try to actually solve any problems. The answer is that neither Republicans or democrats you want to solve this problem because it's too valuable for them to use for fodder for fundraisers and scare tactics for campaigns. Just like so many other issues.

We just finished probably the darkest archon quest so far, along with several fucked up world quests, and after Baal repealed the Vision Hunt Decree, everything is suddenly sunshine and rainbows again.

The recovery period can take years or decades, and the ramifications of these things shouldn't be treated lightly. But that's exactly what Baal's story quest does, treating these things very lightly. It's just very jarring after witnessing so much suffering that the people of Inazuma went through.

Second, would it hurt them if Baal at least saw how her people have suffered and actually felt regret and empathy? No, in fact, it would actually give her a proper redemption instead of the ""look how cute and clueless I am! I'm not evil!"" crap that the story quest brought.

"hfsk8xb","Hey personally I appreciate you reaching out and asking for clarification and wanting to understand things better. Personally I don't agree with the downvotes you're getting.  I thick its great you want to find out more and are curious which I welcome.  

Now I want to answer your questions with what I've concluded and gathered after having thought about all this and experienced in my life.  Also sorry this reply is so long.  

The solution isn't simply lay down and die.  Yes we want extinction but by the way you phrase it, it makes it sound worse than it really is.  We want to end suffering and create peace which you should know is impossible to achieve as long as live exist (especially humans).  Humans are always going to want more, we as a species can never have enough so we will always want more and this desire will lead to suffering. But again that's not to say we want to just lay down and die.  Personally I want to keep living and make the most of what I've been dealt in life.  I have desires and dreams of my own and I personally want to live a decently long life (although it can feel overwhelming at times thicking about living too long and dealing with all these thoughts of how horrible the world truly is but I'm working through it). We don't advocate for suicide, we simply just don't want more poeple coming into existence to experience the harshness of reality.

Humanity has grown and improved for thousands of years and yet there is still so much suffering in the world right now.   No matter how much we grow and improve, we will never be able to fully get rid of suffering. So long as we are alive there will always be pain around the corner.  Pain and suffering is impossible to completely wipe out unless you're plan is to just have your brain hooked up to a machine that keeps you locked in a dream world where you're basically God but at that point is that really living?  There will always be conflict so long as humans desire which is something we can't get rid of.  We all can't just come together and understand one another and live in harmony, that's a fairy tail dream and if you truly believe that's achievable than you are fooling yourself. And let's just say for arguments sake it is achievable one day in the future. How many more people have to suffer until we reach that point?  Are you ready to sacrifice your children, great grandchildren, and great great grandchildren just so those great great great grandchildren can experience unless inconvenience and suffer than we are now? What does that say about your character if your wiling to being in your own children into suffer for people who don't even exist now?

Reach out for the stars huh?  Yeah okay so we can invade another planet and drain it of all its resources and slowly kill it like we are doing to earth?  See that's you not really thinking through what you're saying.  You assume just because we reached the stars and can travel across galaxies that we somehow are better and happier?  Except no, it just proves how hungry we as a species are to expand and drain more from the universe because of our desire. How exactly does resching the stars make us better or happier as a species?  It only expands our area of effect which as our history shows is mostly destruction.  We will also be expanding the amount of suffering in the universe.  Do you really think that if we find other creatures similar to us that we will just get along and live happily ever after?  No it only means more wars and conflict. We can't even get along with ourselves, let alone aliens.  And thus we have expanded suffering to another set of life forms. 

Solving the problem is impossible as I've stated before. You really need to open your eyes to the harsh reality of the situation we as living entities have been put into.  I know thinking about all the horror in the world is not something we like to think about and that's natural but that's your brain tricking you because otherwise we'd go insane. This is why more poeple are becoming depressed in this day and age. Because we have access to so much information online that allows us to see all sides of the world and experience horrors that we would have otherwise not known about if we kept to ourselves.

 Look up the subreddit r/natureismetal.   I use to ignorantly think nature was beautiful and wonderful.  And Yay some animals ate each other but it was the cycle of life.  But that subreddit has shown me the true reality of what nature is. It's unforgiving, it's callus, it's unempathetic, it's horrible the things these creature have to go through.  Worse part is they are completely unaware and ignorant of the greater picture.  They breed off instinct without a second thought to the horror of what might await their young.   Well we are aware and I believe we can do better than them. We need to fight these primordial instincts to breed so we don't end up throwing new life into the gualet of suffering that is life itself.

And I know you might be thinking, dang this guy sounds depressed and down and must have a horrible life.  I don't actually.  I have a decent life.  I go to college, I work in at a job that I enjoy and makes a difference in people's lives, and I still manage to find time to socialize and have fun with friends on the weekends.  I'm a healthy individual with no health concerns.  I work out consistently and work on my own personal passion projects like making terrain, board games, cosplay etc (you can see in my post history).   All this while still whole heartily believing everything I have stated here. 

So I please ask that you think much harder about life and expand your perspective beyond your comfort zone. Don't remain ignorant and blind to the true reality of the universe like animals do. We can be better than them and do what's right.  The only true path to peace is voluntary extension. 

If you want to talk more about this or ask more more questions, my DMs are open and I'd be happy to talk more and expand on anything you want to know more of.",1633650745,"worse part is they are completely unaware and ignorant of the greater picture.","unaware and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"completely unaware and ignorant","unaware",NA,"completely",0

"hfs20xw","The British Empire mainly cared about money. The American Revolution was a mistake.

Firstly, it was inevitable it was going to happen. However, the time in which it happened was the worst.

For a reason, the king then didn't want the colonies to expand and decimate the native population, he set up a limit east of the Appalachians. After the US got its independence, none of this mattered anymore and many more atrocities happened. 

One thing that I don't like is that modern Americans forget about that. The British Empire chiefly cared about money, but the Americans having its independence too soon in time was a worse turn of events to the world. 

However, if they had proved that they were indeed the country of the free and whatever, they would have been better than that empire then, but they weren't. It's an irony, how do you call a country of freedom if you destroy other people's freedoms?

The British completely messed it up, they should have given them representation.

The British Empire was a very ambiguous force in the world, it was mostly driven by self-interest. I think a lot of Brits know that the Empire made bad things alongside few good things.

However in the US, Americans are completely oblivious and ignorant of the bad things their country has done in the past.

Every country, the US, the UK, should know and acknowledge that they have done bad things in their past, and strive to be a force for good now.

Part of the problem is local and state leaders, from school boards up, hamstringing what districts can do. There's also the funding problem. Add to that district admin who fear poor optics, and make stupid choices that actually increase the chance of bad optics . . .

Idaho passed a law that school districts can't be held responsible for this sort of thing, so if the parent in the article tries to sue . . . . she's not likely to get anywhere, sadly.

Getting the lower classes of all races to fling shit at each other and fill up the news cycle not only creates a subterfuge to extract wealth from *all* during a time of crisis, but it gets the educated knowledge workers (usually white suburbanites but also any minorities who 'made it'; money doesn't care about your skin color) who were promised the middle class American dream... it gets these people who keep the machine running &amp; the sausage made, gets them scared and ignorant of the meager pittance they have and how quickly it has eroded. 

Making the narrative ""white ppl bad, you should feel bad b/c of the color of your skin"" when you're barely treading water is part of the plan, and it works incredibly well - corporations are machines that turn dollars into more dollars, concentrating wealth up the chain. White collar workers are the essential cogs that keep it running - you can hire anyone to flip burgers, you need educated programmers and analysts to really run the place on the scale that's allowed them to dominate and control markets.

I think so, yeah. Some might disagree on what constitutes people, but that's usually the result of misinformation and ignorance as well.

&gt;Is that you?

yup

&gt; You are a disgusting apologist for conservatives

Nope. You're welcome to read my other comments. 

&gt;They start from ""I am never wrong. I am always good."" and then say what ever they need to until they get to do what they want and still say that, no matter how little sense it makes.

Right now you're starting from ""I am never wrong. Conservatives are always evil"". I disagree with conservatives on most things, and they probably believe I'm a filthy degenerate of some kind, but that doesn't mean I don't want to understand them. That's all: understanding whatever you're opposing. Who knows, maybe there's a nugget of truth hidden in the shitheap. I prefer to know the content of shitheaps so I know what smells to expect.

&gt;Yes you are. You are saying they are merely complicit in evil, merely allowing it to happen and frequently swept up in evil, but that doesn't make them evil. Your apologia is despicable.

People are people. I'd say the same about communists. Do you think conservatives are all evil? That they were born evil? I doubt you do. They're people just like you and me, they just grew up all fucked up. Disagree with them vehemently and strongly and never tire, but understand that they're people who think they're heroes rather than villains. At least you'll know their arguments before they give them, and you can be better prepared to shit on them.

&gt;The pandemic proved that they don't even care to protect their own families.

The pandemic proved that many, many conservatives are dumb, ignorant, stupid sheep that have been so riled up into skepticism of experts that they reject the word of medical doctors worldwide. If people received rock solid education from childhood, do you think they'd be as stupid? I doubt it. Are American conservatives just inherently a stupider breed of human? No.

&gt;No. You are deluding yourself. The only way the conservatives change course is through a change in leadership. They don't listen to reason, they don't listen to morality, they might listen to money.

People are complex. Let's not pretend to KNOW what would convince certain people. We can only speculate. Even if we assume you're right, don't you think these people think that the best society is made by following a strong leader towards a better world? This can lead to Trump, but it can be stupid and wrong and easily exploitable while still being ultimately well intentioned.

&gt;It doesn't matter what they tell themselves. It doesn't matter what they tell other people. It doesn't matter if they believe it or if they know they are lying. All that matters is the consequences.

Yeah, that's why I'm not conservative - I don't like the consequences of their policies. I just think most of them have been fooled into thinking these policies are ultimately good for everyone. Anti abortion? Obviously they don't *want* women to get back alley abortions. They want, naively, girls to be pure and good and abstinent, because they believe that leads to a better life for the young women, and society in general. They're dumb and wrong and ignorant of course, but I'm sure they well-intentioned rather than wanting people to suffer for no reason at all. 

&gt;They know what they are chanting. They should be adults who know what those words mean.

Yeah, they should. World doesn't run on should though. We shouldn't have such a bad society that we create the environment for these types of idiots to form. Meanwhile, I still don't believe the majority thinks they're fighting on the villain's side.

&gt;You insufferable smug... I could call you a million derogatory names and it still wouldn't be enough. You ignorant punk. You revolting apologist. You useful idiot. All of those just barely scratch the surface of your repugnance.

How am I being a useful idiot just because I know we all think of ourselves as good people with good opinions, even if some people's views of what constitutes good has been twisted to absurdity? 

&gt;How dare you presume I am quick to judgement or throw labels around meaninglessly

Haven't your entire reply been about how people you deem ""fascist"" (I'd love to see your definition of ""fascist"" btw) are simply impossible to be understood, and trying to do so is useful idiocy? Sounds like you're both throwing labels and making judgements pretty readily. Also, do you believe conservatives are fascists? Or basically de facto fascists?

&gt;It's not some difficult thing to understand. Not if you aren't an apologist like you. They want total control of the government, mostly the monopoly of violence, to run things as they see fit, silence all dissent, and use violence against any and all opposition.

That's just the first level understanding. Fascism is all fucked up and often inconsistent. At least I wish to understand what I don't even understand. Understand?

&gt;Holy shit. You are ""just asking questions"". Because there is no need for one. The political right has no idea how to govern or how their lives benefit from government. Their entire leadership is pure kleptocracy now. The right has no idea how to choose capable leadership, or honest leadership, or even non-criminal leadership any more.

I haven't really asked any loaded questions as you imply. I just stated that I believe all human beings consider themselves, or want to be, overall good. You've written off about 50% of the country with your statement. Good luck winning any political victories with this mindset. Do you seriously not believe any conservative voter/politician has ever had any true opinion on anything? That'd be pretty silly, so I doubt you do.

&gt;&gt;Maybe if we all understood each other we could find more agreement.

&gt;It's bullshit that you think that the left doesn't understand the right. Who really needs to understand the right is the right, because they are getting scammed and led into political violence.

No one understand jack fucking shit about the other side, so no, leftists don't understand rightwingers. At least 1 study also showed this. Check out this study from 2012:

&gt;Both liberals and conservatives exaggerated the ideological extremity of moral concerns for the ingroup as well as the outgroup. *Liberals were least accurate about both groups*

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092

So I don't believe your statement is fair or accurate.

&gt;&gt;if they knew there was an open, honest conversation about how to improve the world

&gt;Dude, how can you say this when the right is completely dishonest. Jesus, this is the most pathetic apologia I have ever seen.

It's kind of funny how much my desire to understand makes you angry. Do you understand it's possible to seek to understand, without agreeing with or apologizing for anyone, and without pretending that we all agree that we all agree (not a typo)? 

And yes, I agree that many, many, maaaaaaaaaaany rightwingers use dishonesty as a tool to just win power. Doesn't mean I don't want to understand them, either to know what lies they say, or just out of general curiosity. 

&gt;They have no ideas. Remember the lack of a political platform. They only have ""values"" that their actions work against and their rhetoric argues against. 

Their lack of ideas doesn't change that I believe we all want the same, basic shit in our society. Maybe it's possible to show them that certain, progressive ideas are so tried and true that even they believe it. Maybe we could win a few more political victories this way and improve a few more lives.

&gt;When do you stop believing what they say?

I haven't really started. They're usually also not the kind of people who want to have hour long conversations about deeper, personal motivations for impossibly complex policies affecting millions and millions of people.

&gt;You and people like you should be ashamed of yourselves.

"hf2s4n8","Ask someone who says they believe that a fertilized egg is a living person this question:

&gt; You are in a fertility clinic with a newborn infant and a cryogenic container with 1000 frozen embryos in it.  The clinic catches fire and you can only carry out one or the other.  Which do you save?

I've never heard anyone seriously choose the embryos.  Which means they don't *really* think that a fertilized egg is as important as a newborn infant.  You can also discover this when people allow for exceptions for rape or incest.  (No one would suggest killing an infant under those circumstances.)

What they are demonstrating by being pro-life usually isn't how much they value fertilized eggs, but rather how little they value a woman's experience and bodily autonomy.  Or even actively deprecate it.

Another easy test is to tell them that ""free IUDs lower abortion rates more than an abortion ban would"".  Again, I've never seen a religiously-motivated pro-lifer suddenly embrace IUDs, because usually they just call it abortion, too (when it's not).  Well, what about oral contraception?  Nope, that's abortion, too (again, it's not).  What about condoms?  Surely they would at least encourage condom use for people who are already having sex anyway?  Not so much.

If you search ""pro-life contraceptives"" on Google, the top responses [say things like this](https://www.ethikapolitika.org/2011/04/04/facts-on-abortion-why-you-cant-be-pro-life-and-pro-contraception/):

&gt; Contraceptives are the cause of abortion.  In fact, if we did not have contraceptives in this country, we would not have anywhere near the abortion rate we do now.

&gt; These situations, where people have bought the lie that they can rely on these technologies to make sex non-procreative, are the context in which abortions happen.  It is in this context that people get pregnant and ask, ‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù  This context does not exist in a society that does not have things like the birth ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù pill.

[Or...](https://clmagazine.org/post/pro-life-basics-whats-wrong-with-using-a-condom/)

&gt;Even if the person asking the question doesn‚Äôt want to admit that condoms offend God because they are used to intentionally deny Him the ability to bless a couple with His gift of a child, it is critical that you pass along the truth that condoms can cause all sorts of havoc for the people who use them.

If this was about fertilized eggs, then why are they against contraceptives?  If this was just about fertilized eggs, why is there substantial pushback against HPV vaccines in pro-life circles?  [It's because this is all about sex.](https://prolifeaction.org/2009/91020-2/)

&gt;The success of this public vaccination campaign has less to do with stopping cervical cancer, than it does with opening the door to other vaccination campaigns for other sexually transmitted diseases, and perhaps even including pregnancy itself. For if they can overcome the objections of parents and religious organizations to vaccinating pre-pubescent‚Äîand not sexually active‚Äìgirls against one form of STD, then it will make it easier for them to embark on similar programs in the future.

&gt;After all, the proponents of sexual liberation are determined not to let mere disease‚Äîor even death‚Äîstand in the way of their pleasures. They believe that there must be technological solutions to the diseases that have arisen from their relentless promotion of promiscuity.

There are lots of ordinary people who are pro-life and not given it much thought (even though they give it their votes).  But the *activists* are not interested in reducing the number of abortions. 

These pro-life organizations just use abortion because it's the easiest way to push people toward their bigger agenda.

"hetz29s","&gt; Seven's struggles with re-integrating her human aspects were played off essentially the same way that Data was used, as just something inhuman learning to become more human.

There are literally multiple episodes where she relives the trauma and flashbacks of being assimilated and has emotional breakdowns as a result. I'm not gonna question if you've seen VOY or not but you're clearly forgetting these important facts.

&gt;And it wasnt just how VOY handled assimilation; they watered down the entire mysterious alien-ness of the Borg by bringing in the Queen to be the ""face"" of what was, up to that point - and with tremendous success - essentially a faceless enemy.

The Borg Queen was a TNG invention, created for the film ""First Contact"". First Contact hit theaters in November of 1996. Voyager didn't bring the Borg Queen in as a character until the episode ""Dark Frontier"" in February of 1999. If you don't like the idea of the Borg Queen, that's fine. But don't blame Voyager for her. They just took a pre-existing character and developed her further.

&gt;And they diluted their scariness by making them not an unbeatable foe, a Tarrasque that cannot be defeated but only be escaped from, and let Voyager routinely win the day, and ultimately just turn them into a Macguffin to get home.

Again, this is something TNG was already guilty of. In ""Best of Both Worlds pt II"", they beat the Borg by making them take a nap. In ""I, Borg"" they personalized the Borg with Hugh, made them seem like innocent children that could be rehabilitated if given the right circumstances, and made sensing and hiding from them child's play. And in ""The Descent"" they turned the Borg into Lore's impotent cartoon patsies. TNG basically made them into a joke, yet it's Voyager that somehow is made to take responsibility here? Highly illogical and ignorant of the facts.

I get liking how mysterious and frightening the Borg were in their first two appearances on screen, and mourning that they stopped being scary, but you're never going to convince me that's actually a bad thing. Because not only is that the destiny of every foe in Star Trek. (The Klingons, the Romulans, the Ferengi, the Dominion, this is just the arc of what happens when you confront an enemy multiple times. They can't be invincible and mysterious forever.) But it's also one of the most basic, core tenants of Star Trek to begin with. The entire point of Star Trek is to seek out the unknown and to learn. And that's kind of what happens when you learn about something. They stop being so mysterious. And you don't fear the stuff you know about nearly as much as the stuff that is a question mark. That's a fundamental aspect of the human condition. And Star Trek celebrates this. If the Borg were going to be scary and invincible forever even though we keep learning about them, that would honestly be a betrayal of the most core spirit of Star Trek that has boundless faith in the human spirit. Maybe you don't come to Star Trek for that, but I do. It's what makes Star Trek special and sets it apart from all the other sci-fi junk that gets made these days that's overly cynical and bleak in its outlook of humanity.",1632995554,"highly illogical and ignorant of the facts.","illogical and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"highly illogical and ignorant","illogical",NA,"highly",0

"heh0u7l","&gt;Are we going to equivocate a labor shortage with wage increases?

Yes, labor is a commodity.  If the supply is lower than the demand, the price will increase.

&gt;Your original post doesn‚Äôt mention anything about people not going into the trades, starting a decade ago. Probably because you can‚Äôt blame ‚Äúthe governmental‚Äù for it.

Or maybe because it wasn't relevant to the point I was making.  The decline in people entering the trades has been going on a long time, while housing prices in Missoula have just recently skyrocketed much more than usual.  Government policies are most definitely a factor in that.  Also, labor prices were just one of several reasons that I gave.

If you want to blame everything on covid, that's fine.  But even *that* can be traced back to questionable government policies.  The Wuhan Institute of virology(where the virus presumably leaked from) is funded by the Chinese and US governments.

&gt;This isn‚Äôt some old persons. It was a young, otherwise healthy person. They‚Äôve had long Covid for a year now, still struggle with it, and it lowers the amount of work I can do. 

This is anecdotal and rare.  Most younger people will recover from covid quickly.

We were discussing the economic ramifications of the policy.  My point was that generally older retired people aren't directly contributing to the economy, not meaning to downplay the emotional loss of anyone's relative.  Also, it's ironic you're now worried about not being able to ""work like you did"" while also defending a policy that literally forced everyone not to go to work.

Covid and the 1918 pandemic really aren't comparable though.  The Spanish flu was far more deadly, particularly in people between the ages of 20-40(prime working age).  That is going to have a much greater economic impact than covid, which mainly only kills the old and infirm.  

Sorry if this sounds harsh, but is it that big of a deal if a nursing home patient dies 3 months sooner than they would have without covid?  Is it worth shutting down the economy?

Ya know, constructions workers never got told to stay at home in Montana. They were considered essential workers.

"hefsjw0","Minister of Justice Maria, who, ironically, has a string of murder cases with her as the prime suspect, seven years of unpaid taxes, and various other crimes on her record, upon finding out about the Legion's presence in the Imperial Federation's capital city, decides that she is going to flee the planet altogether, no, the solar system, and finally go to check out that tropical island on a distant planet in the Ruznov Union she purchased a few years ago.

Chief Warrant Officer Ada Hawks is completely unaware of the Legion's existence, having just woken up at her estate in Windrise Plains

General Nora Wolfe, known as the *'T√∂dliche Sch√∂nheit'* for her habit of draining her enemies (and sometimes even innocent civilians from enemy civilizations), is, like her fellow vampire Maria, quite concerned for her safety. Regardless, she refuses to be a coward like the overly cautious Maria (who is actually her sister-in-law), and calmly loads her personal handgun *Kopfj√§ger*, as she takes refuge in her heavily-guarded manor in the midst of Amberwood Castle's wealthiest neighborhoods.

The Elite Guard officers, who are far worse than Maria, having been behind mass genocides of hostile species and even fellow humans, are unfazed, choosing to recline in their downtown skyscraper and rest for the week. They fight with their superior on a regular basis and *he* could annihilate planets with a flick of his finger should he wish.

The High Regent is, meanwhile, something between unaware and ignorant of the Legion's arrival in the capital city of Anthos on the eastern coast. He believes that a great force will arrive, and awaits their arrival in his residence.

(Anthos is on the east coast BTW, Maria is at the spaceport in the city waiting for her starship, Hawks is in the far east region well over 4000 kilometres away, Wolfe is in the Great Forest region in the northwest about 2500 kilometres away, and the Elite Guard is in downtown Anthos. The High Regent is at his estate on a private island within the city's bay, accessible via a single bridge.)

(The Legion starts on the outer shores of the city, across the river; they have to cross the only bridge to enter the city by foot, as crossing by water is not feasible due to the number of actively aggressive naval drones and warships, and it is currently afternoon rush hour.)",1632718678,"the high regent is, meanwhile, something between unaware and ignorant of the legion's arrival in the capital city of anthos on the eastern coast.","unaware and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"unaware and ignorant","unaware",NA,NA,0

"hec9f09","Well this response packed (again) with ad hominems and which completely ignores/distorts my points and questions strongly indicates that you're either arguing in bad faith.  Still I'll one more time do you the courtesy you consistently refuse me and address your actual comments.

&gt;You just admitted you'll never believe experts, and the same logic of yours can be used with placebos and prayer ""as why would they be used if not effective""

Seems your reading comprehension needs some work as well.  I never said anything remotely like I'll ""never believe experts"" - I have directed you to academic papers written by experts which you have completely ignored because of your strong bias.  An expert is anyone who has done substantial study and work in their field and is highly knowledgeable in it.  You seem to think ""expert"" only means ""expert with a public platform"", which is not the case - those are just the subset of experts whose views are amenable to those with money and power.

The difference between placebos/prayers (or your original highly ignorant comparison, cow dung) and ivermectin is that there is actually strong evidence that ivermectin helps in treating covid, it just isn't definitive.  You treat ""some good but not definitive evidence for x"" and ""no evidence for x"" as if they were the same thing, which is just further evidence of your blinkered black and white thinking.

&gt;Theres no conspiracy if the company making it says dont take it when they would profit then wouldn't that show they aren't bribing.

Two facts that disprove this nonsense:
* Ivermectin is a generic drug.  This means the formulation is in the public domain and anyone can manufacture it, so Merck (the company who *originally* formulated it and then took it off-patent) would not especially stand to profit from it in a production and sales boom.
* Merck have developed their own patented therapeutic drug, molnupiravir, for covid-19, and [last June signed a procurement agreement]((https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/merck-mrk-signs-$1.2b-deal-with-us-for-covid-19-therapeutic-2021-06-10) with the US government worth approximately $1.2 billion, if it gets approval. If ivermectin was recognised as doing much the same job, it would seriously impact the potential profitability of this product and would certainly remove any chances of them getting EUA.

And who mentioned anyone bribing anyone?  Again you're just making shit up instead of addressing my actual comments.

&gt;There's litterly a list presented to you of dozens of other drugs with way more promising results from many different sources and you said you cant trust who because they compiled it.

More lies.  I never said any such thing about The Pharmaceutical Journal.  And I just read (and directly responded to in a previous comment) the section of that article about ivermectin because *that's the drug we're discussing*. You expect me to read through the article's sections about all these other (mostly patented) drugs that have not seen extensive real-world use when they're irrelevant to the discussion, yet you won't even look at the academic papers I referred you to about the drug that we *are* discussing?

&gt;If you take one thing from me Just try to understand your not being censored your just spreading dangerous misinformation that resulted in many people getting sick, you dont seem dumb but your so unaware and ignorant of critical thinking you can hurt someone.

It seems via discussion with the mods that my comments here were deleted because I posted links to the ivmmeta website too often so the spam filter kicked in; it had nothing to do with the content.

Again, you are claiming that Cureus Journal of Medical Science, Cornell University's SocArXiv, Social Science Research Network, and Dr John Campbell's YouTube channel are all sources of misinformation, without backing this wild accusation up in any way.

The only reason people may have gotten sick from ivermectin is because they took animal formulations in which the dosage is too high, which has nothing to do with whether the correctly dosed human formulations work or not.  Your ""logic"" is equivalent to blaming paracetamol overdoses on advertisements for paracetamol, rather than people not reading the instructions correctly.  If discussion of ivermectin were less suppressed and distorted, these kind of incidents would be less likely to happen.  And that's not to mention the fact that many of the news stories that pushed this notion (and no doubt where you've gotten the idea) [have turned out to be lies](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/09/as-us-prepares-to-ban-ivermectin-for-covid-19-more-countries-in-asia-begin-using-it.html).

I won't be taking anything from you, given your apparent inability (whether borne of poor literacy, mental laziness, or sheer mendacity) to engage with the evidence I've presented and my actual arguments; your accusing me of lacking critical thinking skills is highly ironic.

Location A -&gt; Walk to town -&gt; Location B

and

Location A -&gt; Teleport -&gt; Location B

I don't think I've ever heard of players just teleporting randomly without some communique with the GM. 

&gt; At level 1, if they find a ring from the princess a hundred miles north, they'll likely ask around, see if there are rumors about what she did on her visit.

I don't, personally, like this argument because it can be used the other way around.

Only through concerted efforts on behalf of the GOP in gerrymandering and dominance of extreme rural states have they managed to retain the extent of power they still maintain. Roughly 25% of this nation still buy into the core tenants that the GOP spout off directly or indirectly: 'Pro-life', 'Pro-capitalism' and 'Pro-Religion'. Its no surprise that that 25% so represented also coincides with that portion of the nation who are equally sexist, racist and ignorant of the world outside their own personal bubbles who lack even an ounce of empathy in most matters.

I didn't say people with ADHD have zero struggles and autistic people have all of them. I said autistic people have more debilitating symptoms and acting like they don't is just ableism. Have you ever actually interacted with an autistic person, gone out in public with them, been on a trip to the grocery store?? 


Again, nobody deserves to be told their life isn't that bad and to deal with it. But you can't completely ignore that autistic people *do literally deal with more issues* because of their diagnosis and society combined. Do you know anyone with ADHD who went through ABA?? No? Like it's literally torturing autistic kids into acting neurotypical.


And sure, theres a bit of overlap BUT. With ADHD, you can be sensitive to sound, right? It's not going to cause ur brain to shut down or go into overload where you start crying, screaming and destroying things because you're overstimulated. With ASD it *does*. Listen to autistic people. ADHD is hard, obviously. But maybe we should stop comparing ourselves to autistic people, and telling them,, ya know,,, I don't know anything about what it's like to exist as you but I know my symptoms are just as bad.

"hdnsqwv","oh please. I love Taiwan and my people, don't argue with me on that. I find your view too simplistic and ignorant of all the other factors in play that contribute to the construction of a societal mindset. It's so easy to say ""don't be racist"" when you've had lived your life with educated views. Also BLM was created to combat systemic discrimination, which in turn, educated American people on the issues that the Black community faced. Additionally, this worked for the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. All three movements created large shifts in American views on the Black community, so if you fail to acknowledge that, I can't have a proper conversation with you mate. Here in Taiwan there's less exposure, less education, less urgency to educate or need for law reforms (which America had to do with the 13th, 14th and 15th amendment). Hence, Taiwan has slower changing views. Racism is never okay though, which I've mentioned so many times, there's bigger things at play. 
Plus, I'm also speaking from experience, both my grandparents and my dad are uneducated in Black people and their culture, they've also never interacted with a Black person. Occasionally they do say racist things, but that's from being uneducated and ignorant. They don't know they're wrong for saying those things. On the other hand, my sister and I have lived and grew up in Australia. It's a multicultural place, where we're taught about systemic racism and their negative consequences, so we understand making discriminatory statements are harmful. Our views stem from the information we gain from young, where our brains are more plastic and adaptable. Which is why older generations are less able to change mindsets. Would love to go into the neuroscience and psychology behind it (my uni double major), but I'm wasting my time in talking to people who have too simplistic view on everything.

It relies on the idea that the Democratic party is some hive mind that can control all of its members to influence the outcome legislation, an idea that is just obviously false. And its examples used for ""evidence"" are stupid.

The idea that the Democratic leadership selects a politician to arbitrarily block legislation is so stupid beyond belief, one has to be so cynical and ignorant of politics to believe it. Lieberman didn't want a public option. Not because Obama selected him for that role because Obama secretly didn't want it for whatever reason, but because Lieberman absolutely didn't want a public option and no amount of convincing would have mattered.

Manchin is who he is because he was elected in a red state. Biden didn't select him to be the rotating villain, it is just who Manchin is. 

Leftists need to stop coming up with garbage conspiracy theories so they can continue in their single minded quest of blaming Democrats for everything and continuing to question Democrats convictions, and keep up the myth that Democrats don't want to do anything, for who knows what reason. I have never got a good answer on why leftists believe the things they do about Democrats. Just cynical both sides bullshit.

Maybe this is a more comfortable lie than the truth that Manchin is a real obstacle, so conspiracy nonsense like this is invented. Who knows.

I think this doesn't do justice to the truth of the matter. 

It's what happens in the depths of the mind. 

There's a saying that there's three great unknowns left: space, the sea, and the mind. If we're not careful, what comes about through the mind - on this planet and in this time and place - is with, no uncertainty, just as horrific andor *more* horrific than anything what we'll find in the other two realms.

This is largely why there's such a premium put on family and love and compassion and kindness. We must find those things and characteristics within us. We must. We are all ***one*** family. We all deserve love and compassion and kindness.

"hdd17zy","Its definitely is wrong and isn‚Äôt how it should work, but unfortunately it is. It‚Äôs not just a white thing either, it‚Äôs in everyone. The ‚Äúgood‚Äù people of every group is seen as responsible and accountable for the ‚Äúbad‚Äù people of the group. 

For example: In the anti-racism movement of the last few years it‚Äôs dictated that the non-racist whites hold a responsibility for the racist whites, which is true. But saying that these group dynamic exists in one situation but not in another is a bit hypocritical and ignorant of reality.

In my opinion, the only thing that gets past this is frequent and deep interaction between groups. When a group (whites) don‚Äôt have frequent and deep interaction with another group (blacks), they don‚Äôt have the knowledge/experience to differentiate between the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù of the other group, so they resort to seeing the other group as being represented by the ‚Äúbad‚Äù because it gets the most attention.

"hdbzf4t","In some ways, yes, and in fact this very question was first put forth much earlier than you might imagine, as a moral and philosophical question, and more narrowly in context of what should be the acceptable rules of violent conflict.

As early as the 19th century, when multiple-fire firearms were first being developed, some thinkers began to wonder about the appropriate role of various 'machines of war', as they became more sophisticated, deadly, and, over time, more removed from their human operators and commanders. Early multiple-fire weapons proved devastating, as they were intended to be, but raised serious questions by and about those who used them. While the general principle of superior power had of course always been central to armed conflict, the notion of deadly overwhelming power by a single operator was a relatively new idea in the world, and one which started to raise ethical questions.

Drones and other standoff weaponry press these questions further, by forcing us to ask if it's moral to kill other people at no personal risk. The drone could be shot down (and they sometimes are), but no human operating one is at risk, at least from the vast majority of adversaries we use them against. We would not consider it fair for a boxer to go into the ring in plate armour, while his opponent stood bare-chested in Everlast shorts. Warfare at least **implies** mutual risk. Otherwise, where do we draw the line between warfare and wonton murder?

I'm not proposing answers here. These are questions discussed in earnest by people who have many years of formal schooling in such discussion, and I am not one of those people.

Its still incredible free compared to most overall. Freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms and protect your family and keep tyranical dictates at check, mostly free entry into the marketplace where the little people have a real chance of moving up, etc (so long you stay out of heavily regulated and red tape sectors like healthcare, etc).

"hd8q3gz","&gt;Sorry, but this is the most patronizing bullshit of all time. The problem isn't that native Miamians don't know that high-skill careers exist, and for the ones that that's true, you aren't spending time with them and don't know they exist because they live in a completely different world than you. The problem isn't a lack of awareness - these people aren't idiots and know how to Google shit. The problem is not enough opportunities to increase skills. 

It wasn't meant as patronizing, and it's unfortuante you took it that way. See my [comment here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ppokou/in_the_south_florida_market_the_average_rent_for/hd8njp4/) to get to what I'm coming from. It has more to do with just being surrounded by that environment to not only inspire you, but also pave the way.

&gt;How do you increase skills? You provide resources for education and a job market that prioritizes locals over hiring from outside.

Honestly, that's part of it, but a lot of time, it's because people here about them. It doesn't mean they will take action. If you are surrounded by it, you are far more likely to take action. Why do you think concentrated areas get even more concentrated?

&gt;Yeah? Name a high school without Googling.

Unfortunately, I do not have kids. However, that is a ridiculous way of measuring if people are part of the community. 

&gt;Again, you're not some kind of super genius that sees opportunity that other people miss. Everyone sees the opportunity. They just don't have the same opportunity to pursue the opportunity you pursued. Your entire mindset appears to be some ""noble savage"" shit.

Looking at people this way isn't going to help you. Heck, the opportunity is everywhere. Plenty of people have educated themselves online. There are plenty of free resources, and let alone low cost options including ""scholarships"". There are plenty of remote jobs in IT and software engineering. So you tell me, why aren't you all pursuing this? 

Why is it not an opportunity for you all today?

&gt;But you tech workers don't do any of these things. Driving a nice car and living in a nice condo isn't inspiring or showing people the path. Circlejerking yourselves at a tech meetup isn't teaching. Creating a business doesn't do shit if you don't commit to hiring locals. You talk a big game about all these great things tech workers could do, but what have you actually done to improve wages for the people who you're displacing?

I drive an old Toyota Corolla 2010'. To some that may be a nice car, but hardly what you are describing.

&gt; Creating a business doesn't do shit if you don't commit to hiring locals. You talk a big game about all these great things tech workers could do, but what have you actually done to improve wages for the people who you're displacing?

Let me ask you this, what have you done?

It's a collective thing and the responsibility is on the community overall, which I'm a part of. A lot of this is also indirect. It's not like silicon valley just came out of thin air. It's something that was cultivated and spread. San Francisco for instance didn't always used to be a tech center, but rather San Jose. Today it's different.

&gt;Again, you're missing the point. You ARE the status quo. You think this wave of tech bros is the first group of people to figure out that Miami is a cheap place for remote workers? Hell, that was old when I moved to Miami 6 years ago. The status quo is importing rich douchebags (myself included) and stuffing them into cheap luxury condos and hoping that somehow prosperity will osmose out through magical thinking and luxury car sales. And that's not how it works.

That's because you insulate yourself in ""luxury condos"". Here is an example, I'm in Miami Beach. It's pretty nice area, but the schools here are complete shit show. Poorly rated. Extremely surprising considering the home prices. Why do you think that is the case?

&gt;No, what I'm asking for is for the city and county to spend money on affordable education and local entrepreneurship, because importing workers from elsewhere does not build community wealth and actually causes segregation through gentrification.

It can be, yes. However, investing in affordable education and local entrepreneurship doesn't necessarily mean it will be successful either. Furthermore, it's not an either or. Why can't you do both?

I think people forget what America has always been about. It was about the American dream, and immigration. 

&gt;No, they won't. How arrogant and ignorant of Miami's history do you have to be to think that you are the first skilled worker to ever move to Miami? The only reason you bothered moving here in the first place is because many many waves of prior skilled migrants moved down first and necessitated the building of the services and luxury condos that you just assume were sitting there waiting for you. Your entire argument is premised on the assumption that this hasn't happened like clockwork every couple of years for the last thirty years and you're the first person to figure this out, or else that it'll be totally different when you do it because you're the specialest!

What I'm hearing from you is that you are set in your ways. Refuse to see opportunity. People that succeed are those that does things. Not those that are naysayers. Naysayers don't succeed in anything. 

&gt;By giving them an education and support. No one needs you to nurture them. They need a high school that has enough computers for everyone and a top tier local university that's affordable.

Dude. We spend plenty of funds on education. That's not the problem. Money isn't the issue. 

&gt;I'm glad that you finally discovered remote work, I really am, and I'm happy that you think that this is some amazing new thing, but you're at least a decade too late.

No, what I'm asking for is for the city and county to spend money on affordable education and local entrepreneurship, because importing workers from elsewhere does not build community wealth and actually causes segregation through gentrification.

&gt;and now you are getting the start of that with people that are skilled and moving here. They will create opportunities and spread it.

She never says the vaccine made him impotent, or made his balls to become swolen. She relates a story told by a friend, as to why that friend isnt getting the vaccine.

It just feels so cheap, disingenuous, and makes every female character feel so unsympathetic because they all feel the same. It's just boring to see women who never truly encounter real struggle or have any flaws because all their troubles in these films are because men made it hard for them and they would be perfection otherwise in a world without that. Not that I think Simu Liu's character is developed any better, but Tony Leung's character is handled in a more realistic way where even though he is technically the bad guy, his flaws and strengths are both highlighted and he feels like a real person.

1. Men drive more and longer distances than women so it stands to reason men would be in more accidents

2. Men are generally more aggressive drivers than women (because men generally take more risk in life), but more women drive obliviously or passively. Aggressive driving requires more focus and attention to detail

3. Many times, passive driving can be more dangerous than aggressive driving. Driving slower than the traffic around you while being in the wrong lane is a bad idea. Women and men do this, but women more often than not do not think about the left lane being the passing lane -- or other cars around them.

"hcuq1k1","&gt; It does. They are overcompensated for minimum to no productive labour done.
Do you actually have... any charts on this? Like, do you have empirical evidence that the wage paid to all first-world proletarians fairly compensates them? Because, if they did get paid the fruits of their labour, then they‚Äôd be living under a successful form of capitalism... ignoring the fact that the boss would not be able to pay these workers without taking some of their surplus, of course. 

And sure. Western call centres in your country can pay more than the average. That doesn‚Äôt stop zero-hour contracts where the wage is paid as low as possible while excluding other payments from being bad jobs. Being an Uber driver and being paid a small amount of money only to have even more be taken in gas costs isn‚Äôt a utopia where you‚Äôre overpaid.


There was a labour aristocracy developing in the Russian Empire, but sure. And no, not student protests. Full on strikes and revolutions. You can literally google ‚ÄòThe 1917-1923 Revolutions‚Äô for this. 

&gt; And even yeah there was a devastating war where the imperialist superprofits weren‚Äôt coming in as much so it just proves the point further.

Firstly, what? More people are influenced to rebel because of material conditions changing? That‚Äôs not just your point, that‚Äôs a pretty obvious thing. And secondly, no, that‚Äôs not even true. For example, before Britain entered WWI, the country was literally weeks from a group of trade unions bringing the country to an absolute halt by striking over the most fundamental industries. The only material conditions affected there were the ones which caused by half of London being in poverty in that time. 


&gt; And Bolsheviks didn‚Äôt deal with the same shit in Russia?

Almost like each country has their own material conditions and specific set of circumstances and challenges which it faces, which determine how things are overcome... 

And, even then, Lenin wasn‚Äôt thrown in the Neva by Kornilov in 1917, if I remember correctly. The Russian military also defected from the counterrevolutionaries to the revolutionaries, while the German protofascist soldiers did no such thing. 

Also, your assessment of German interwar history is MASSIVELY oversimplified and ignorant of material situations then. This isn‚Äôt something summarised in a sentence, this is a 500 page book.


&gt; Where were the revolutionaries in the 30s?

They happened to be leading third in the country‚Äôs elections and on the verge of a revolution, which is why, out of fear of the communists, Hitler was put in as Chancellor. It‚Äôs also why Hitler immediately banned trade unions and the communists, and why all the other parties approved giving Hitler the absolute powers to do this. Plus, this wasn‚Äôt even a time when their parasitic status was regained. Their parasitic status was regained in the 20‚Äôs. They were just being *wayy* more exploited by their bourgeoise in the 30‚Äôs due to economic crisis. 

&gt; Where were the anti-war protests and brink of civil war if they were *so* opposed.
Locked up. Rule by fear works if in minority government and done well. 


Germans did indeed feel fucked after Versailles, but not so much by the late 20‚Äôs. Stressemann had passed agreements which basically made Versailles‚Äôs problems minimal, and it was only Hitler‚Äôs scapegoating during the Great Depression which brought Germans back to hating Versailles as much as they did in 1919. 


I would disagree also that Moscow/Peterburg zone and parts of Belarus do not qualify as a labour aristocracy. Their situation is moving towards being almost the same as the West, though the embargoes with Europe may change Belarus. 


Calling Mao a reactionary is ironic. He‚Äôs probably the second-most progressive leader of the 20th century behind Lenin. I don‚Äôt even support him fully, but your hate for him comes from the completely wrong direction.


&gt; imagined imperialism

So Hirohito, Hideki Tojo, their literal slave-state in Manchuria and their horrific war crimes in Korea and China are now just ‚Äòimagined imperialism?‚Äô Was this a mistake or are you deranged? 


&gt; because of chauvinism and revisionism
Find me the Mao quote where he says that he fought the Japanese invasion because he hates women and Karl Marx. Please. 


&gt; Funny how the GDR and Czechoslovakia had the best living standards and economy but were in fact imperialized by a country with 60% of their GNP per capita?

Imperialism isn‚Äôt when you make more GNP per capita than your imperialiser. Cuba made almost as much as the USSR, but when reading about how the USSR forced Cuba to become a monocrop country for sugar, it becomes a bit certain that they performed imperialism on some scale. 


&gt; Social Imperialism is not a thing.
Lenin disagrees. 
*‚ÄùThe leaders of the present-day, so-called, ‚ÄúSocial-Democratic‚Äù Party of Germany are justly called ‚Äúsocial-imperialists‚Äù, that is, socialists in words and imperialists in deeds.‚Äù*
- ItHSoC, Chapter IX
In case you want to say that refers to social democrats and not socialists, remember what Khruschev did to the USSR by the time Mao had made that comment and how much he had ruined Stalin‚Äôs policies.


The letters you send only proves that Marx and Engels both believed that the British Proletariat was taking the surplus wealth of the colonised, which I agree with. That doesn‚Äôt mean that they still aren‚Äôt being paid a wage and not being paid for the fullness of their labour, and therefore not exploited. 


&gt; If I not only get the full fruits of my labour but am also compensated by someone else‚Äôs surplus 3x over, no I am not exploited.

"hcp4kjc","When we read the Bible, it's always important to read it as ancient literature. That means being aware not only of its historical context, but also of the constraints and expectations set by its literary genre. Genesis is itself split into two major sections: Chapters 1-11 give a macroscopic overview of the creation of the earth (called a cosmogony) and the beginning of civilization (a common theme in many ancient myths); Chapters 12-50 then give a microscopic view of the history of one particular family, i.e. the family of Abraham.

In some ways these two halves of Genesis are a coherent whole and tightly bound together (as shown by the ◊™÷π÷º◊ï◊ú÷∞◊ì÷π÷£◊™ '*toledot'* clauses, i.e. the ""this is the generation of..."" clauses that mark major breaks in the narrative of Genesis). On the other hand, these two major sections (the macroscopic and microscopic) exhibit characteristics of different literary genres in the ANE. The first half is a cosmogony, i.e. a creation myth. To understand it, we need to understand how cosmogony worked in the Ancient world, and what kind of expectations and constraints an ancient reader would have went in with. Long story short, the real point of a cosmogony was to teach something about life, God/gods, the nature of humanity, and social morals. It is questionable as to whether people took these to be literal accounts of creation, or figurative illustrations. Probably it was a little of both. There is evidence that some took these stories literally, while others, especially the social elite (and thus the ones most likely to author such a work), did not. Nevertheless, these myths were often appealed to as examples of how to interact with the gods and as guidelines for life and ethics. All of this suggests to me that the historicity of this particular section of Genesis is secondary, at best, to its theological and moral significance. In other words, whether or not this is a historical account of creation doesn't matter as much as what it tells us about God and the life he has given us.

This isn't the only space in which understanding genre is important either. In fact, the implications of genre get much more complex when we realize that there are both macro and micro genres present in many texts. For example, we describe the general genre of the Gospel of Matthew as biographic, and more specifically as an ancient biography of the Greco-Roman Period. This larger genre sets certain constraints on our understandings of the text itself. For example, we should expect that the author assumes a historical reality behind the text. At the same time, as it is an *ancient* work of literature, we should not expect the author's portrayal of those events to be as rigid and strict as those found in modern histories.

Even once this general interpretive lens is set by the ""macro"" genre, we nevertheless must alter our interpretive constraints based on genre shifts within the larger biographical setting. For example, within Matthew, which is biographical, we also find examples of poetic hymn (e.g. Mary's *Magnificat*) and parable (e.g. many of Jesus's teaching). These genres set expectations and interpretive constraints that differ from the larger work of Matthew, and we need to be aware of these shifts in genre throughout the text. It would be silly and ignorant of us to interpret the parables with the same eye on historicity as other parts of Matthew, or to fail to shift away from the parabolic genre once we moved on to more biographical details of Jesus's ministry. Likewise, it would be inappropriate to interpret Genesis 1-11 as a work of history if, in fact, its genre was unconcerned with giving us historical information.

So, in answer to another user's question in this thread, the motivation to question parts of Genesis as history is basic reading skills. God could have communicated his Word in any way he chose, but he chose to deliver in the form of a collection of various types of literature. We must learn to be astute readers and accept that God spoke via these different literary genres rather than insist he must speak in the way we want him to. To insist on reading Genesis as part of a genre to which it does not belong is to insist that God speak on our terms, which is a grave theological error.",1631545161,"it would be silly and ignorant of us to interpret the parables with the same eye on historicity as other parts of matthew, or to fail to shift away from the parabolic genre once we moved on to more biographical details of jesus's ministry.","silly and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"silly and ignorant","silly",NA,NA,0

I am no theologian so I can't judge the theological quality of the writings based on that. But by observing its structure and contents, it and the Gospel of Luke appear as ulterior to Mark or Matthew, not only chronologically. As if the author had had time to sediment the accounts of the first two. And the last Gospel alleged by John is the most schematic of the four and the most theologically involved. I don't believe that that any Christian theologian that's worth his salt can claim that any of the Gospels have been actually written by their alleged Apostles or by any witness to the Jesus narrative. In the Gospel of Luke I think it is actually called a ""narative"" and not an ""account"" as it has been previously claimed.

"hcad0mm","Remember with softcore, it still can be a video uploaded without consent. There is a lot of revenge porn. I‚Äôve read about women who found out their exes uploaded stuff and they suffered. What if that would happen to you? If your family, friends etc could see you online being very vulnerable?

The women in porn, whether it‚Äôs in vanilla or hardcore porn, still could have better lives. Most women are young and brainwashed into believing they want this (thank you liberal feminism). It‚Äôs still oppression of the female gender. What I want for women, is that we/they all have the option for education and a good job, for a fulfilling life and respect. The women in vanilla porn are still being objectified and after they quit they will still not be seen as normal humans but as ex-pornstars. Have you seen how men react to ex-pornstars? Like the women are worth nothing. It‚Äôs horrible.

It‚Äôs good to see men want to quit porn, but porn is just a puzzle piece in the complete puzzle of misogyny us women face. Women always have been and are still oppressed by men. And this is the issue: lots of men don‚Äôt even realize how privileged they are because they have a penis/xy and not a vagina/xx. My husband is a good man who never watched porn because he always thought it was dehumanizing women, however he never realized how normal it was he can go outside in whatever he wants to wear without being ogled at. I can‚Äôt wear what I want. If I wear a tight fitting dress and heels I literally don‚Äôt feel safe at the street. This is just one example. I can only advice you to look at all the misogyny a woman is facing in the world. Every man who stops watching porn and educates other men about the effects on men but especially on women, are very hard needed. 

Oh and my last point I actually do think there are a lot of people (well, women) who are good at emphatizing with others problems without knowing them or having faced the same problems. Maybe we‚Äôre like this naturally, but we‚Äôre also being groomed. It‚Äôs literally expected from us, so we can become a good wife. We even emphatize with mens ED due to porn to a certain level, until we see those men only quit porn because of their own issues so they‚Äôre basically being selfish and ignorant of the misogyny porn is.

"hc5zu8x","&gt;It seems like windows server is better suited for you then.

No. No, no, no. That is not how this works. It is not ""If you want GUIs, use Windows, if you don't use Linux."" That is insanely stupid and ignorant of how and why one would choose Linux intentionally or utilize GUIs on their server.

&gt;It depends, on many thing but, if it's an IT guy, learning CLI is good for him, and I would say good for the company if he is not a contractor.

Let's take the example of a small business in which IT is literally one person, and the owner wants to be able to do something on the server. The owner will *never* learn the GUI. But it is probably better to give him access to the server to do whatever it is he wants because, if you don't do it now he's gonna demand it later, or worse, break something in the CLI.

GUIs provide dumbed-down idiot-safe interfaces to the server. These interfaces are for people who may need or deserve access to the server, but cannot be trusted to actually directly interface with the server.

Another good example; the server is only meant to be run during business hours. Normally it shuts down and starts up automatically, but managers need to be able to disable this automatic functionality and override it for holidays, events, or early shutdowns.

There are a variety of other reasons for why someone who shouldn't be trusted with a CLI interface, and very likely would be greatly intimidated and frustrated by one, may need access to a server. Accounting may, for example, need to verify input data for a timecard system. I could go on.

&gt;If he isn't an IT guy, a well written procedure should suffice. Worst case, get a webui.

A webui has a variety of it's own specialty issues, such as connecting the computer to at the very least the LAN.

&gt;And if what you need is UI for people to use the server, then I'd say use windows server.

No. Use Linux with a GUI because there's no reason not to. You can very easily make it so that the GUI does not take up resources until called on. Most notably, it's easy to tell people ""type in this command and hit enter"" then let them use the GUI. This is as opposed to trying to sheepishly guide them through CLI.",1631183864,"that is insanely stupid and ignorant of how and why one would choose linux intentionally or utilize guis on their server.  &gt;it depends, on many thing but, if it's an it guy, learning cli is good for him, and i would say good for the company if he is not a contractor.","stupid and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"insanely stupid and ignorant","stupid",NA,"insanely",0

You made that equivalence not me, the article you linked said that is what is happening in Greek waters. 

*""Dinghies travelling from Turkey to Greece are blocked from landing on Greek soil by the HCG. This could mean either physically blocking the dinghy until it runs out of fuel, or disabling the engine. After the engine no longer works the dinghy can then either be pushed back into Turkish territorial water with waves, or towed if the wind is not favourable.* 
  

  
*The second type of pushback is employed when people have managed to land on Greek soil. In this case they are detained, placed in a liferaft with no means of propulsion, towed into the middle of the Aegean Sea and then abandoned.""*

You were making the comparison there, in an attempt to deflect criticism from poorly planned government policy. 

Is this what Patel is planning to do? Who knows, like so much government policy it will is mostly just a headline generator, rather than an actual effective set of actions. 

Still, we can only summarise the plan is either to force boats back to France, prevent them enter British waters or force them back to French waters. All of these options are stupid and dangerous and ridiculous policy platform. 

As others have said, these plans will end up killing someone if they are implemented, they also totally ignore international laws we have signed up to.

That's a misquote for one thing and also leaves out the the other reports from many others that there were additional bombs in the building.  I found a [video montage](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=2130) of this so you can see for yourself, it's only a minute and a half.  [Here are witnesses that describes the blast sequence](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=3974).  Here is evidence from [seismographs showing 2 blasts](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4067).  We can also look at the damage done to [Sterling Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hall_bombing#/media/File:Sterling_Hall_bombing_after_explosion_1.jpg) with a 2,000 pound ammonium nitrate bomb which blew out the windows of the building but that's about it.  The OKC bomb was allegedly a 4,800 pound ammonium nitrate bomb and it [blew off the entire face of the building](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/oklahoma-city-bombing-20-years-later-key-questions-remain-unanswered).  When you compare the photographs, does that make sense to you?  In the [Sterling Hall case, many were hospitalized due to the poison gas](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4301), this did not happen in OKC.  A f[ormer director of Airforce armaments laboratory](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4373) who spent his career in bomb damage analysis, investigated the OKC bombing and found it couldn't have been done solely by a truck bomb.  Then there's allegations by a former FBI employee, Dr. Whitehurst, that [the FBI fabricated the evidence involved in the bombing](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4553).  And then the [armament laboratory at Eglin Airforce base conducted tests](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4646) to compare their data to what happened at OKC.  They tried to recreate the truck bomb.  Their weaker test structure suffered less damage from a more powerful bomb.

It's real simple, they could just release the confiscated video footage, but they won't.  Is it not suspicious to you that video footage in high profile cases is never released or goes missing?  Like the footage at the Pentagon, one of the most secure buildings in the entire World, we're told only those 2 crappy videos are all that's available despite there being about a hundred cameras on the Pentagon grounds according to Michael Moore?  Or the Epstein Suicide, oops, cameras weren't working.  Or take [this man's 10 minute story](https://youtu.be/57JCVor3wgo?t=4984), whose brother was connected to the OKC bombing in a strange way.  He ""committed suicide"" in jail, but after badgering authorities to see the body, found that his brother had skull fractures, bruises on his arms and feet, his throat was slit and had markings of strangulation.  Again, video cameras malfunctioned, and the prison logs went missing.  Or how about the JFK assassination, in which the film famously known as the Zapruder film was bought and stored in a safe by Henry Luce of Life magazine and not shown to the public.  We were told for years that JFK's head jerked forward from the impact of the shot.  The film was released due to subpoena in Jim Garrison's case in New Orleans.  That is the only reason we were ever allowed to see it.  And it's only at that point that we realized JFK's head in fact went back and to the left.

&gt;But to say that all unwanted pregnancies are 100% on the man's shoulders feels fucking slimy and ignorant of the human reality to me.


The article isn't arguing this. It is saying that 100% of the pregnancies are caused by men ejaculating irresponsibly. Which is true. That sentence does not mean women are not involved or that women don't own our bodies. Acknowledging the reality that men are responsible does not mean women have no right over their own body. 

You seem to be disagreeing because you do not understand the articles point. It's a common logic error. 100% of x are responsible does not mean only x are responsible. 100% of eggs are round. Eggs are not the only round thing. 

100% of slaps to the face are caused by the person with the slapping hand. If we want to stop slapping we cannot only focus on slapees. We should also focus on the slappers who are doing the action, instead of exclusively blaming, targeting, and punishing the people being slapped. Slaps are caused by those who slap, and that statement does not contradict the fact that consensual slaps also involve the consent of the slapee. Women always bear the responsibilities of an unwanted pregnancy, men rarely do, so why is the law focused on only punishing women?


I would add that if a woman gets pregnant without intending to, the vast majority of burdens will fall on her. It sucks but it is self inflicted, not inflicted onto someone else. A cis man causes pregnancies for someone else. So if you want to discourage that behavior you can't ignore the men causing the problem for others, in order to exklusively punish the ones who the problem is being inflicted on and who  carry the burden.",1631033556,"&gt;but to say that all unwanted pregnancies are 100% on the man's shoulders feels fucking slimy and ignorant of the human reality to me.","slimy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"slimy and ignorant","slimy",NA,NA,0

"hbldkhi","Hm, I see there are downvotes. Yet it's true that UK data shows Delta deaths are mostly to the vaccinated right now and the link I gave is to official UK data on a UK gov site. So these facts should be acknowledged and addressed and the actual specific lies in the conspiracy site article OP published be addresses and refuted. All the most convincing lies are draped on skeletons of truth. It's fundamental to cons and propaganda and limited hangouts.

&gt; The government of the United Kingdom has released new data showing that the vast majority of ‚Äúdelta variant‚Äù deaths are occurring among people who got ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).

It's not the ""vast"" majority but it's a small numerical majority (54%).

&gt; Only one third of all deaths [in the UK form Feb 1 to Aug 2] caused by the delta variant are occurring in people who did not get the jab,

Misleading.  Some deaths were to partially vaccinated. 54% were to fully vaxxed, 34% to unvaxxed, 11% to partially vaxxed, the rest unknown vax status.

&gt; which clearly shows that ‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed‚Äù is an utter failure ‚Äì assuming that ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù was the goal, anyway.

This claim that the vaccines are utter failures is totally false and ignorant of data and statistics.

&gt; From February 1 through August 2, the U.K. recorded 742 deaths allegedly caused by the delta variant. Of these, 402 were fully vaccinated while 79 had received just one shot. The remaining 253 cases were unvaccinated.

You can view the official government report outlining the data at page 18 at [this link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009243/Technical_Briefing_20.pdf).

- 741 deaths total (71 under age 50, 670 over age 50)
- 402 fully vaxxed (13 under, 389 over)
- 253 unvaxxed (48 under, 205 over)
- 79 partially vaxxed (8 under, 71 over)
- 7 unknown

Do note that 71 deaths were people under 50 and 48 of them were unvaxxed and 13 vaxxed. So 68% of under 50 deaths were to unvaxxed and 11% partial and 18% vaxxed.

Think about that carefully.

**Only 18% of under 50 delta UK deaths were to fully vaxxed people.** Vaxxed are 4.4 times less likely to die (79/18) than the others for under 50. So efficacy against death, given that you are infected, is currently 77% for this age group.

For over 50 though things don't look as good. 58% of over 50 UK delta deaths were to fully vaxxed and 41% to unvaxxed and partially vaxxed.

This is possibly because the older group got vaxxed in January, younger people more recently, and we are finding vax effectiveness drop off over time. Older people also have more health problems and comorbidities. This is all a huge problem. But still doesn't explain the numbers seen as the rates should not be upside down as they are. Breakdowns into more age ranges might give insights. For example if 65+ is much more vaxxed than 50-64.

The issue with the under 50 group being opposite of what it seemed at first is related to Simpson's Paradox which turned out to explain some of the weird data from Israel earlier this summer.",1630778232,"this claim that the vaccines are utter failures is totally false and ignorant of data and statistics.  &gt; from february 1 through august 2, the u.k. recorded 742 deaths allegedly caused by the delta variant.","false and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"totally false and ignorant","false",NA,"totally",0
"hbkdbo3","It's not that simple. For most people, religion has little to do with the truth. What most people are looking for is a channel to express their ""spiritual/religious impulse"" through symbols and metaphors. Organized religion is the first available option waiting for those who wish to express the inexpressible. A stage of looking for answers externally before looking for them internally.

Where there is demand, there is supply and religous organizations are the first external entity to respond to that demand.

It is only a small percentage of people who are willing to sacrifice their comforts and longing to belong to honor the pursuit of the ""truth"". Most will not let truth get in the way of their beliefs because the truth often leads to more questions than it does answers.

The cognitive dissonance is a result of an attempt to protect and preserve what truth will take away. Atheism in and of itself does not add, replace or restore purpose. Islam serves a specific purpose while Christianity caters to another. The belief system adopted is reflective of the current state a person is in. Using a ""factoid"" or two to derail or dismantle a person's belief is irresponsible and ignorant of the impact it can have on someone's development.

Given that it was only Bush's 2nd year in office, it seems he may have been trying to blame the Clinton administration for it. Many of [Edward Snowden's leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-5MMTbSlA) revealed a lot of the secret programs and weapons development earmarked by the black budget and the Pentagon's accounting black hole after two more decades of endless war is [now around $35 trillion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/pentagon-35-trillion-accounting-black-231154593.html).

No, it wasn't.  It was a widely held idea that, even in it's heyday, wasn't agreed-upon by practitioners.  Phrenologists couldn't even agree amongst themselves on the most basic organ numbers.  Scientific tests disproved the idea at every turn.  It was discredited as an ideology specifically because it was NOT fact.  I'll explain it again like you're five:  A fact is something that is without-a-doubt, provably true.  Phrenology was never that.  The rest of your statement in that paragraph also illustrate your misunderstanding: ""and plenty of people **believe** in Toxins, Intelligent Design, Homeopathy, Genetic Memory, Vaccinations cause Autism, Melanin theory, and antifa really does fights fascists.""  Emphasis mine

Belief does not = fact.  Intelligent design cannot be proven, therefor it is not fact.  Homeopathy has been proven to not work so it is not fact.  Genetic Memory cannot be proven so it is not fact.  Vaccinations are proven to NOT cause autism so that is not a fact.  Melanin theory has been tested and disproven dozens of time so it is not fact.  Antifa's EXISTENCE isn't fact as there is no organized movement of people who plan on getting together to fight against proud boys and other white supremacists.  You're equating opinion with fact.  You're doing exactly what I'm railing against.  You do not know what a fact is.  As for the rest of your bullshit list, I'll go ahead and answer it because it is easy to do so:

No, non-biological women can't get pregnant.  That is a fact.  The ability to get pregnant is not what defines a woman though.  That is also a fact.  My wife had a full hysterectomy at 28 due to cancer concerns so she has no female reproductive organs and can't get pregnant.  Is she no longer a woman?  The fact is: she is.  

No, white people aren't the only people who can be racist.  The word racism has a factual definition and ""must be white"" is not in there.  But racism isn't ONE thing, that is also a fact.  Systemic racism in America, for example, does not exist against white people at this juncture because white people set the rules that make the system racist against non-white people.  And again, these are verifiable facts.  Jim Crow laws existed until the 1960s.  My parents were teenagers when legal oppression ended.  After Jim Crow ended redlining existed until the advent of universal credit scores in the 1990s.  That is historical fact.  I was a teenager then.  Systemic racism factually exists, but you don't have to be white to fit the definition of racism.

&gt;Women are not men or is it men are not women?

This is you being willfully ignorant.  Everyone agrees that there is such a thing as biological sex.  What reproductive organs you're born with determine that.  And there ARE three.  Male, female, and hermaphrodite.  From there things are still in flux.  It IS a fact that brain structures and hormone level studies have shown consistencies in people who identify as a different gender than their biological sex.  It is also a fact that not everyone who shares similar brain structures and hormone levels go on to identify as a different gender than their biological sex.  This IS a space where some opinion exists because not everything is fact.  But history tells us that gender-identity-fluidity  has been a concept for as long as people have recorded history and that societal acceptance of that fluctuates with time.  Those things are also facts.  So people saying shit like ""women are not men or is it men are not women"" ARE being closed-minded and ignorant of the complexity of gender throughout human history and that is a fact.

Whether or not it's cultural appropriation for a person outside of an ethnic group to own a restaraunt in that ethnic group is entirely opinon-based.  It IS a fact that the owner of that restaurant is profiting off a culture that is not their own though.  The opinion lies in the morality of that.

The hosing poop-covered sidewalks is another place where you're being willfully ignorant.  One council-person said that it reminded him of when police would uses hoses against civil rights activists and the reason he said that was because there WERE people still present and protesting when that cleaning was happening.  So no, cleaning poop-covered sidewalks being culturally insensitive is not a fact but nobody ever said it was - nobody ever even had that opinion as you and the right frame it.  And THAT is a fact.

&gt;Expecting people to be on time is culturally insensitive.

Imagine this scenario.  You travel to a foreign land for work or school or a meeting or something.  Someone tells you that there's a meeting at 9 am.  You arrive promptly at 9 am and nobody is there.  Everyone shows up within a few minutes and they socialize a bit before getting down to business.  You get all angry and loud about how they should've all been there at 9 am on the dot.  They calmly and nicely explain to you that in their country, a 9 am meeting means 9-ish.  In that scenario, why should your opinion about what a 9 am meeting means be the only one that matters?  Your culture has taught you that 9 am means 9 freakin am.  Their culture has told them that 9 am means ""9ish.""  The fact in that scenario is that you were culturally insensitive to how they treat time.  They were also culturally insensitive to how you treat time.  Those are both facts.

You do not know what a fact is.  I am not saying that someone gets to decide for the rest of us what facts are ok to be heard and what facts are not.  I'm saying that opinions that are demonstrably wrong, like a large majority of your post to which I'm responding, have no place being given a platform.  They're WRONG.  They aren't facts.

"hbcc5ww","&gt;  Isn't that because Kickstarter has become a glorified pre-order system?

Yes? If publisher wants to offer exclusives on Kickstarter the value proposition is higher to back the Kickstarter despite lower retail pricing. If the publisher wants to offer exclusives on their website the value proposition is higher to order on their website despite lower retail pricing. No value proposition? No reason to buy for ~20% more. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say an informed consumer will recognize their options and an informed business will understand that.

OP decries this practice, but any time I put myself in a hypothetical publisher's shoes I don't see why I wouldn't use it - it's certainly not forbidden by Kickstarter (they make bank) and people seem to cling to this notion that it's just for the 'little guys' and anyone who uses it otherwise is abusing it.

If my choices are 1) try to project unit production amounts from a finnicky market and then secure loans or lines of credit upwards of a million bucks plus (that my business is on the hook for if I'm wrong) only to turn around to sell to distribution for a fraction of MSRP, OR 2) get an exact gauge on my production run, receive those funds immediately (no need for that loan!), AND make ~90% of MSRP per sale? The only reason I would not do this is if Target or Walmart has perpetual agreements for me to fill their shelves.

Is this consumer friendly? Fuck no, I'm not particularly interested in someone earning interest on my money either. But that's the thing; the Kickstarter is 'for the common folk' schtick is just that, a narrative people have bought into for some reason while the platform is absolutely designed to extract value from high performing projects.

One: yes, last year's protests were against police brutality and racism in law enforcement the criminal justice system.

Two: just because something else kills more people doesn't mean that other causes of death aren't a serious problem or threat. Saying that people are ""guilty of deflecting or being stubborn"" for focusing on racism in policing and excessive use of force that's disproportionately used against minorities while other problems exist too doesn't make any sense. By your logic, it's ridiculous and ignorant of us to put any time, money or effort into cancer research because heart disease kills more Americans than cancer. It just doesn't work that way. 

Three, there's a huge difference between inter-personal crime and state-sanctioned violence. Police officers represent the government and act in its official capacity. More so than just about anyone else, they should be treating people equally in the face of the law. There's no legitimate way of fighting back or defending yourself against an officer. Even if your actions are justifiable, they will not immediately be perceived as such. It's absurd of you to pretend that people are being dishonest because they're more vocal about *literal representatives of the state* being racist and disproportionately (or fatally) violent / abusive / aggressive against minorities than they are about gangbangers shooting each other. Surely you understand the difference between unraveling the intricate net of huge socioeconomic and cultural issues circumstances that fuel inner city violence on the one hand, and racist cops being all too eager to arrest and harm people of color?

Four, you really shouldn't be using sources from 1983 when more recent research available, but I'm actually glad that you picked this source. Because the abstract of the study literally states that ""a criminal justice system which places higher value on a white life than on a Black life"" is a direct contributor to why black people are more likely to become a ""homicide statistic"" - **which is literally what these protests are all about**.

Being fully independent can't change being young and ignorant of a lot of the world though, especially socially, in a way that leaves some vulnerability because it nothing can build that besides time and experience. I don't think I'd consider myself rare, I had many more distant friends who also weren't in college but instead were working multiple jobs and no longer living at home - we were both in ""mature"" situations but we still shouldn't have been considered on the plane of 30+ year old adults or anything like that given there's so much at play.

And that's where it gets in weird zones of what line exactly should be drawn like people are debating here. Personally even if I was mature in some ways I do not think it would have been good for me to be dating someone older, nor do I think it is in general. I agree it should be very discouraged for such an age gap with young adults but disagree it should go so far as to being ""disallowed"", but I can see the argument from certain angles. This is also different than what I'm arguing about considering young adults as children vs. adult, which I'm realizing I should have clarified way earlier whoops - 12 and 17 are both children yet explicitly illegal for a reason, 18 and 17 are adult/child (or wherever you draw that line there's always the border years) yet allowed, 20 is an adult yet still restricted from things based on age, a category containing two adults doesn't mean it has to be a free\-for\-all. In general I don't think it's good to go down the path of denying autonomy to people who live fully independent, besides philosophical stuff there's no denying they'll still do it but instead get more barriers and stigma preventing them from reaching out for help if they need it, but I also get the feeling behind blocking it.

Here is my problem with that though.

um, sorry but come again? I think im interpreting this incorrectly but youre saying a video of a guy who said he was fine until he lost his job and couldnt get the UI owed to him?

I mean if thats exactly what you meant; thats typically what happens when someone loses a job, no? If you need $X per hour to pay the bills and the only available jobs pay $1/2(X) then of course people are going to be stuck and need assistance or become homeless. If they were to take $1/2(X) job, then theyre spending the same hours of their life as the $X job, except now they cant afford bills because the $X was already the absolute lowest their boss was able to give them. 

I'm sure youre already aware that wages haven't kept up with inflation over the years so now minimum wage has people living paycheck to paycheck. What do you think happens if theyre out of a job for even just a week? Now they need to come up with ~$400 more. This isnt just for people at minimum wage but everyone as minimum wage is the bar to gauge how well 'better' jobs pay too. Now what if, due to corona and the fact that having a lot of part time employees costs less than a few full time, this person isn't able to get the same $X and same 40 hrs? Its very likely if theyre stuck looking for a job that pays more than minimum wage and is full time, the will be looking for work longer than a week. Bills dont just disappear in this time.

"hacwfoz","I think Subaru would summon Arturia or Okita.

Arturia seems to be quite appropriate for Subaru in terms of the basis of their personality, in a broad perspective, they seek to save people and see themselves as a valid sacrifice if it achieves the safety of others. To the point that they can see themselves as tools (and Subaru touched on that mentality a lot in Arc 4, due to their power).

Okita is a more complicated issue, but it's more of an interesting choice. She is known for having two sides; that of a cold-blooded killer and that of a person with a lot of affinity for children. Her last wish in life (and which she fulfills just by participating in the Holy Grail fights) was and is to ""fight to the bitter end"", that is, to fight alongside a person until they are inevitably outmatched (how appropriate) and die. 

I chose Okita in particular because the interesting thing is in her approach with danger: she's *very* overprotective, like, *quite*. The other Servants may care about their Masters, but Okita, at least the vast majority of the time, relates on a very personal level to people, especially those she's supposed to protect. In Fate:Redline the first thing she did after being summoned (when the fight was over) was to grab her Master by the cheeks and talk to him as if he was a child (I think the MC was 17 or 18), so you can imagine how she would interact with Subaru, who radiates childishness everywhere. 

But to the topic, back to what she's overprotective about: her approach with danger is very direct and ignorant of the mood (again, how appropriate), if she considers something a threat to her Master, she won't hesitate to kill or put her sword to the target person's neck (usually more the former than the latter unless instructed otherwise). Even if he was initially friendly with that person.

This character in the world of Re:Zero would simply be very difficult to contain, I mean, for example; Rem's initial hostility would be almost enough to justify killing him should he step slightly out of line. 

Yes Subaru acts like a jerk in the Royal Selection, Julius will have it pretty bad too; from Okita's perspective, even if she doesn't see Subaru's behavior right, she'll let it go because, well, she sees him as just a kid. And watching Julius beat Subaru for her will be like watching a respectable gentleman, in a position of power, beating a child, something she'll intervene in even if Julius just wanted to help Subaru and even if Subaru chose to accept that duel (something she'll probably understand and at least make Juli not end up decapitated all at once during the fight).",1629934569,"but to the topic, back to what she's overprotective about: her approach with danger is very direct and ignorant of the mood (again, how appropriate), if she considers something a threat to her master, she won't hesitate to kill or put her sword to the target person's neck (usually more the former than the latter unless instructed otherwise).","direct and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"very direct and ignorant","direct",NA,"very",0

Still, of all things you chose to say ""people should not do X"" in the context of rape **victims**. While you could have chosen to speak out about the atrocious humans that rape, you voluntarily chose to critic the victim. Prevention of rape is nice, but dictating that people should not ""do X"" is catering to the rapists.

&gt; I would simply be sad that they didn't protect themselves instead of putting themselves in a dangerous situation that increased the probability of them getting abused.

That's the problem itself. Instead of blaming the rapists, you blame the victims that just weren't careful enough. It's sad that rapists exist. Being sad that a rape victim just wasn't careful enough *is* victim shaming, putting the blame on the victim.

&gt; I wouldn't tell them not to get out of the house, I would just tell them not to put themselves into contexts or places that are particularly dangerous, just like you teach people to check both sides before crossing the road.

Here it is again, you'd tell a rape **victim** that they just didn't act good enough to not be raped.

Also, comparisons are fun and cute, but the victims of inatentive drivers are not to be compared with victims of cruel humans.

&gt; No, that's just wrong, plain and simple. Taking the chance to rape away from rapists is objectively the exact OPPOSITE of catering to rapists, literally by definition.

Telling rape victims to avoid the known places where rapists act **is** catering to the rapists, whether you like the sound of that or not. ""Just don't go in these places and you won't get raped"" isn't also part of reality. Rape prevention is far more than spotting dark alleys where we should just leave the rapists be rapists.

&gt; Your choice of words is incredibly stupid at best and incredibly dishonest and nasty at worst.

Thanks, I try my best. Very nice personal attack.

&gt; ""To be in the path of a rapist"" makes it sound like I'm saying rapists have a right to rape anyone who is naive enough to not be alert when it comes to protecting themselves.

That **is** what you're saying. You're bringing forward that the victims *could* have avoided to be raped if they just did X or Y. Which is victim-blaming.

&gt; Of course they don't. Doesn't change the fact that women have to be alert, we all know that unfortunately rapists still exist.

And it's **always** 100% the fault of the rapists, not the victims who hung out in place X instead of Y.

&gt; Recognizing that someone who is wronged can, out of ignorance or naivety, have done something unwise that facilitated a certain outcome is not the same as ""blaming"" them.

In that context of rape, yes it is. It is blaming the actions of the victim instead of blaming the perpetrators. A voluntary choice in your words.

&gt; ""Blame"" is a loaded word with connotations that we tend to associate with moral condemnation.

That word has an actual precise definition: ""responsibility for a fault or wrong"" which you are putting on the actions of the victims.

&gt; The only person who should be morally condemned is the rapist, because he is the only one who acted immorally, so ""blame"" should only be directed at him.

Then it's truly puzzling that you'd be blaming the victims then.

&gt; However, the victim can be unwise and ignorant of certain dangers

Rapists don't go around with a ""I'm a rapist"" sign on their person, we're in a context or rape victims here, not general ""certain dangers"".

&gt; and all I'm saying is that everyone should be taught to protect themselves so that they are careful with who they trust and what situations they put themselves into because the world is an ugly place and horrible shit happens to people who do not deserve it

That's true and nice, a change from your previous stance.

&gt; especially if they are not careful enough to avoid danger.

Damnit victim-blaming again, back to square one.

You could launch yourself into a quick Google with keywords such as ""why is victim blaming bad"" and you'll see why you **are** victim blaming even if in your heart it's not your intent.

A good amount of them were pro-Trump and still are. There are a few people who were pro-Trump, but also not interested in any of his election fraud stuff (like Barr, Pence, and Jason Miller). Some people who end up looking good, like Redfield, Fauci, Milley, Wray, Haspel, and Esper. Some people were trying to protect Trump from the world and vice versa. 

Most people just seem like they are trying to weather a storm and do good things. Trump, Giuliani, and Stephen Miller are the only people who come off almost universally unflattering.

"ha2x1se","That was the first thing I thought of, too. I was young when ZPG was a thing (for too short a time because, yes, it was bad for business), and by the time I graduated high school ""The Pill"" was becoming the most effective birth control. I was convinced ZPG was right back then, and even more convinced today that they were correct.

I can also remember a bit later when the US anti-choice people, already horrified by the ""red scare"" of communism, were doubly horrified with China's one-child policy to the point that if birth control didn't work the government could (allegedly?) force a woman to have an abortion. What the anti-choicers neglected to understand is that if China had not done that there would have been mass starvation because their population was so large to begin with that birth rates left unchecked would have meant not enough land to raise food crops (and other countries were boycotting them and not trading with China as a communist country). The Chinese one-child mandate was abused because girl children were given up for adoption (or, worst case scenario, killed) because males were (are) considered more valuable. It's my understanding that in today's China there are more males than females so they don't have enough females to have wives for all males. In the rest of the world there are usually more females than males in most populations. Not by much (?apparently?), something like 51% females to 49% males, but still more women than men.

In the world of biology it is generally known that male babies aren't as strong or advanced as female babies who usually talk much earlier than male babies, and the male infant mortality rate is higher because they are not as robust at birth. [That info courtesy of my college biology prof who said he envied women for being stronger from the beginning.]

Still, the anti-choice religious freak families (like the reality show family that has/had 19 children) that have children for the sake of having children are going to have to deal with a ZPG practice at some point (and they will howl about infringement on their rights!).

Already some adults are choosing a child-free existence. Back in the early '60s I went to high school with kids whose mothers were in a kind of competition for who could have the most children (biological sisters married to different men - both good Catholic families who did not practice birth control, of course; they were farmers so raised their own food so they could at least feed such large broods even if they were otherwise poor). By the time I graduated I think one sister had 20 living children and the other was pregnant with either the 20th or 21st child.

As much as I deplore the anti-vaxxers who are causing death to others, if not themselves, for refusing to use healthy practices (masks, self-isolation, no vaccinations), I also see COVID as a way to kill off excess people since human beings are the cause of so much pollution. 

The fact that it took less than a week in 2020 for skies to clear over the most polluted cities and polluted waters to become clear (dolphins swimming in Vienna's canals that had clear water for the first time that anyone could remember was the most dramatic) when the whole planet went on mandatory self-isolation should have given us a CLUE that human beings are bad for the planet.

If people went back to living on the land (small farms or having a backyard veggie garden if they have a small lot in the city) and raising their own food, we'd be more in balance with nature. City kids who get their food in stores don't have a clue about doing something so simple as raising a veggie garden (with only manure as the fertilizer so the big ag fertilizers don't need to pollute the earth and water and ground water with their chemicals and GMO seeds; another plant fertilizer for flowers is soaking egg shells in water and the water is used as a fertilizer - or so a friend of mine swore, and she had luscious house plants and summer flowers outdoors).

The whole point is that most people couldn't survive if they had to grow their own food, nor could they put a roof over their head by building their own home and keeping it in good repair, let alone a barn structure and/or care for cows, pigs, and chickens, then preparing some of them for winter food if they had a freezer or had to can both veggies and meats to preserve for winter food, nor would they know how to raise grains for bread for themselves and hay and grain to feed animals over the winter.

Besides a lack of good schools in the US, kids are raised to be hopelessly inadequate and ignorant of any means of self-preservation, let alone how to care for the planet, other life forms on the planet, and how to keep themselves, let alone a spouse and children, fed, clothed, and housed. People who are multi-talented in how to take care of themselves and their families are distinctly lacking in numbers nowadays.

I also don't know why the first guy concluded that? There are many other scientists saying the exact opposite and I have seen no one else make a statement like that. I just want to know where that conclusion is coming from.

Your argument is valid but only if vaccinations don't actually decrease infectivity. It honestly doesn't make much sense for it not to decreased infectivity since vaccines function by fighting off viruses faster, therefore, destroying virus particles faster and reducing production. I would like to see a full study if you have one that shows vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads.

 Mandatory vaccination is nothing new. Dal already has mandatory vaccination for other programs. It is best to assume vaccination reduces spread (since they typically do). I don't want a new strain developing that is unaffected by vaccination and giving us an entire new lockdown. Best to reduce the amount chance this virus has to mutate by getting vaccinated.

"ha25278","&gt; and will enough people get vaccinated for these stats to allow herd immunity.


[Herd immunity is literally impossible even if 100% of people were vaccinated](https://www.politico.eu/article/herd-immunity-not-a-possibility-with-delta-variant/). 


[Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads in communities with a high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387v1#disqus_thread). 



&gt;We find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.


So regardless, even if 100% of people were vaccinated, it would not end the pandemic, it would not make a difference. Covid will become endemic and will be with humanity until the species meets its inevitable fate. **Barring people from an education or forcing them to present their ""papers"" in order to grab dinner is Orwellian. Once governments have power over the individual, you will never get it back. Vaccination mandates and vaccine passports make no logical sense and are just a way for the government to have more control over you**

Getting the covid vaccine is backed by science. But so is rapid testing, proper mask wearing, and early treatment with anti virals. When has the science of vaccines ever been debated?

Glad we agree. Moving on.

It actually wasn't, but if you think that's a point I don't know what to tell you. Nobody ever said everyone is going to be gay and there's no reason to have a problem with lgbt people or couples in the slightest. 

&gt;Uh.... because they don't destroy the church?

I mean they literally bastardize everything jesus taught and push away young people and anyone with a decent college education so yeah they are destroying the church..

That is literally the point of the OP.

"h9n1aw8","The shrieking shack podcast recap The Deathly Hallows chapter 17 Bathildas secret.

Mercy upon me I hate this chapter

Recap

=they put on the invisibility cloak and try to leave godrics hollow and try to find bathilda.

=Harrys childhood house is a memorial.

=They meet Bathilda and shes can see through the cloak.

=shes extremely old and frail. And harry feels bad and helps her

=Bathilda has pictures of grindelwald and its...a little odd I wont lie(how grindewald looks in this and in the movies is STARK)

=Hermione is skeevy dont blame her theres so many bad vibes harry should be able to read from this scene.

=Harry follows Bathilda and is very trusting for no reason

=Bathilda does a trick literally so fucking old ‚ÄúLOOK BEHIND YOU‚Äù

=Nagini bursts out of Bathila...never explained how.(i mean as in where from...I dont wanna know where it just says burts )

=and they attack and they fight (I low key love what dark or evil fanfic sturn nagini into its really adorable what they do to her. And make her as the sort of big sister of voldemort its just so bizarre and lovely)

=Harry Nagini and Voldemort all see through each others eyes.

=Voldemort is positively incensed they left. And Im going to quote ‚ÄúI have failed and only 2 doors down from the last time I failed‚Äù (did you really write that rowling?)

=harry wakes up from the situation and his wand was broken. Harry then realizies the guy from the picture is grindelwald.

Chapter analysis:

=they like this chapter far more than i did. My opinion? This book has broken them and they are praising garbage because its not the boring and frustrating dog shit or confused mess of the past few chapters.

=Xeecee says this book is a glimpse into what he thinks would have made this book very good. 3 pillars are 1: Evil Hogwarts, 2:Heist, 3: Resident evil. Im not sure I follow.

=Xeecee says if this book was better this chapter would be viewed worse...but because its a ‚Äúgood‚Äù chapter in a bad book its an island of great..(I am going to disagree with them here This felt like a farce in all the bad ways)

=they like the idea of a creepy corpse lady who was watching them in the graveyard. I felt more like It was a more the sound of Nagini moving in the woods.

=they talk about all this tension in a chapter that to me felt like a bad comedy with no actual tension. And tons of absurd moments with harry ignoring his instincts for no reason as Hermione literally signals alarm bell after alarm bell and honestly I have no idea why harry cant detect them.

=they talk about how much you can swap out harry and hermione for other characters in this and honestly I felt like that was its problem harry and hermione are just blegh they might as well be other characters.

=they talk about how it uses the wizarding world...and I have no idea how. The Talking snakes are somewhat sentient...WE KNOW THEY ARE...they can control bodies?...and????? Thats not weird its a corpse shes very sentient she mostly stumbles around the room like a snake in a corpse.

=Praise for the harry potter memorial that i felt like was more disgusting hero worship to be honest. Godrics Hollow is treated like a holysite where wizards come to pilgrimage and visit the holy site where harry was born...I just...I feel disgusted reading about it.

=Xeecee calls this book bad and confused and has no idea what to do with the characters or what they want. Like its an extension of the authors confusion.

=Xeecee talks about how this chapter has motivations and these motivations arent new and honestly arent really great motivations. He talks about motivation clashing and again it feels like Xeecee is applauding dogshit because its trying and hes tired of the book giving him nothing for 16 straight chapters and will take even still very very bad chapter that just barely works and is semi coherent. To me this feels the same only this time its harry acting very stupid and ignorant of warning signs that even Harry should notice, hermione pointing to the problems. Then harry falls for an extremely obvious trap that I cannot believes hes stupid enough to fall for. And then Voldemort arrives fails to capture curses and screams like a child. Relives the night of the murders which are the only moments approaching okay. And then they flee and it wakes up in the tent and I wish i could have seen Hermione get Harry out.

=‚Äùthemes Characters, motivations desires‚Äù FUCKING WHERE ARE THEY XEECEE? Are you complimenting fucking crumbs because its not the nothing you were getting before?

=‚Äùthe characters failures feel characterful‚Äù How harry falls for a trap that im pretty sure he should see coming, he ignores horrible vibes coming from every thing in this house the smell all of it Harry is just...stupid and oblivious because he needs to be it doesnt feel like he should be.

=they say its one of the few chapters they remember. Its one of the few I do to. And I hate this chapter its harry being an idiot and oblivious gets tricked by a really stupid trick, Voldemorts a joke, and then relives the night of his murders. I just its ony good scene does not save pages of frustration.

=more praise for crumbs thats all I can call this. Its just it gives something and thats apparently time to throw a party not actually give a shit if what it gives is worth of anything.

"h9ktqxt","lets go through your points...   


Cage Children...   


OK so first off no one ""caged children"" in the sense of putting them in like cages for animals. Children were detained and they had to go somewhere. They could not be sent home because no one would take them from the other side. And They could not come into the USA because they had no one to take them... So they where given shelter and protected against the elements, given food and drink, kept warm and protected from danger... I am not sure what else you wanted the border to do. They are not a baby sitting service. They did the best with what they had.   


Taking children away from parents...   


Well yes cops remove kids from parents. That is like SOP in almost every case in America. I do not know of any place that allows adults and minors to be detained together. Also you have to keep in mind that a lot of those kids were taken away from people who kid napped them and used them to get into the states or were taken away from sex traffickers. This was all documented and anyone with half a brain can find this out.   


Valid Reasoning...   


You have got to be kidding right? Are you just that ignorant of the real world?   


Let children die...   


You are either grossly misinformed about the American Public, or just stupid. And I mean that. I do not know of a single American who would just let kids die. And frankly shame on you for that. You should know better. Any person who is at least half way enlightened and out of the dark ages would see that we do not just let kids die. Pick your words better.   


Because they have access to Guns and Shoot each other...   


See again this is just gross misinformation. Guns are not just available to get. You can not just go down the street and get them. People do not just have access to them. You can not just go get a gun. I welcome anyone to try and just go get one. You can't. There rules and laws in place. Evil people will do what evil people will do despite rules and laws. That includes not locking up those fire arms, taking care of them, education for those around them, and supervision of those who use them. You can not say that kids just have access to guns.

"h9ksjn9","1. How long did you know this person? I absolutely would be put off by someone who barely knows me trying to pass judgement on my previous relationships. It‚Äôs my lived experience; only I or people who know me well should be making any sort of comment on my past relationships. You as an outsider cannot know whether they were good or bad choices for me because only someone with an intimate understanding of who I am as a person and how I changed after those relationships would be able to see how the choices I made affected me. If you only knew this person for a short period of time, then you are being incredibly rude and ignorant of the fact that these are not your experiences and this is not your life, or the life of someone you know well. Unless the person directly asked you for advice on what they did wrong in the past, this is an unnecessary comment to make. It‚Äôs like women who say they are straightforward and use it as an excuse to just be rude and judgmental. Then, if someone calls them out on it, they‚Äôll turn around and say people just can‚Äôt handle the truth. No; people don‚Äôt accept others being disrespectful to their experiences unprompted if they have some self-respect.

2. If you had left it at the first half, it would have been cute and romantic; adding the second half makes you sound a little off, like someone who has an academic/scientific interest in romantic relationships (the addition sounds like something Data would say off of Star Trek, so it makes you seem very clinical).

3. This makes you come across as callous. You can rephrase the exact same statement in a more palatable way, possibly something like: I‚Äôm a problem solver, so it‚Äôs difficult for me to hear that you‚Äôre having a negative experience without wanted to find a way to fix it. I‚Äôm not good at just being an active listener/just a shoulder to cry on. (Note: this is a good skill to learn in a relationship, not every negative comment needs to be solved, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just talk shit with your partner as that can relieve negative emotions for situations.)

4. ‚ÄúMy previous experience with marriage has soured the concept of it to me completely. I still believe in commitment and dedication, but I have learned that marriage is not for me.‚Äù (Note: this is a valid reason for someone to end a relationship with you; some people have marriage as an end goal, and if your values in that regard don‚Äôt align, you cannot fault the other person for ending the relationship over a nonnegotiable. Your honesty in this context is important, and will help you weed out incompatible partners.)

5. ‚ÄúI admire you for putting your kids first, it shows me that you understand your priorities, I would do the same if I had children. However, I don‚Äôt, and I can‚Äôt see myself shouldering the responsibility of someone else‚Äôs children, especially if we are not in a long-term, committed relationship.‚Äù (Dependent upon whether that is your boundary, or if you can‚Äôt see yourself ever bearing responsibility for another person‚Äôs kids, leave off the ‚Äúespecially if‚Äù part.)

If the United States Military stayed in Afghanistan (not that we should have, fuck that), and/or actually went about fighting them effectively and with the intention to win (because as I said in my previous reply, I'm surprised people in this sub don't acknowledge the fact this was a war the elite purposely dragged out) then Taliban would be fucking toast.

The United States Military has absolutely fucking destroyed numerous terrorist organizations in the past. Why? Because they weren't part of a war that was inflating the MIC with billions and allowing the state to further collect tax revenue to fund it. It was a matter of utilizing the intelligence community and socom to demoralize, isolate, and surgically strike. As opposed to the never ending bombing campaigns of Afghanistan that just hit random goat fuckers who's lives meant nothing to the Taliban itself, but maybe his family, who then decided to join up for that sole fact.

Well let's see, the hijackers were identified as members of Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden was the leader of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, and days before the attack Osama called his mother and told her he would be going into hiding. Oh, and in 2004 he did eventually claim responsibility. So yea, there was a ton of evidence and everyone knew he was guilty at the time, including the Taliban. Why do you think they agreed to hide him in a secret tunnel in the days leading up to the attack? You think Osama told them he just wanted to play hide and seek? 

It's really ironic that you are calling me ignorant. 

""So? The US regularly agrees to things to then ignore them"" 

Stupidest argument I've ever heard. No, we can't just ignore international law. 

""You are no better and probably helping worse people the Taliban ever did""

No, you are by repeating Taliban propaganda where they try to paint themselves as victims. They knowingly hid a person responsible for killing 3000 people in addition to all the other attacks he committed. They refused to hand him over knowing that we would be obligated to attack. There is no clearer justification of a war. 

""Your point is that you are moronically dogmatic and ignorant of the actual history.""

Not at all. You're the only one acting that way. You're the only one who kept drawing out tangents to circle around the main point that Europe can't help Ukraine against Russia.

"h9a4kkl","&gt; The problem with your post and ""Believe all women"" bullshit is that it runs counter to how our justice system has worked for centuries.

The person you're responding to never said believe all women. They said take allegations seriously, which should happen. If someone makes an accusation it shouldn't just be dismissed out of hand, it should be listened to and investigated.

&gt; The onus isnt on Bob to mount a defense and prove her wrong. Its on HER to come up with proof it happened.

That might be true in Criminal Court, where the government has to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But I'm Civil Court, where it's only a preponderance of the evidence, both sides are fighting to tip the scales in their favor, to reach that 51% threshold. So yeah, you're kind of wrong about the onus being just on her side in the court system, specifically when we're talking lawsuits.

&gt; I flat out dont believe all women. I believe women (or men) with evidence. Thats the difference.

Sexual abuse typically happens in private. Minors are groomed to think it's normal and are instructed or threatened to not say anything, often by family members and other people they trust. To think that there would be overwhelming physical evidence for these sort of crimes is naive and ignorant of actual sexual abuse, spoken like someone who has never handled these types of cases and investigations or dealt with actual victims. Testimony *is* evidence and should be considered as evidence, but it should be scrutinized like any other piece of physical evidence. I'm sure you want DNA and the likes but certainly if the accuser said an incident happened in a particular hotel room and it could be confirmed that the suspect was in that hotel room on that specific date, that would likewise be evidence although it wouldn't necessarily be the smoking gun you peobay want. Obviously that's not happening in Dylan's case, which goes to my earlier point of take allegations seriously, then investigate. Also, don't conflate a civil attorney filing a lawsuit with an actual police investigation, grand jury indictment, and government prosecution...they're not the same.",1629202692,"to think that there would be overwhelming physical evidence for these sort of crimes is naive and ignorant of actual sexual abuse, spoken like someone who has never handled these types of cases and investigations or dealt with actual victims.","naive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"naive and ignorant","naive",NA,NA,0

We may be a minority - a genuine minority - but we exist.

I grew up in a Bangladeshi heavy community, in England.  I saw the racism and entitlement up close.

I've had Bangladeshi friends compare my complexion to the soles of feet (sylheti rhymes, black = good, red = dog skin and white = soles of feet), to denigrate me and feel better about themselves, because their parents would coo about how fair I was, how rosey cheeked, how they wish their sons looked like me (this was in the infants!).

Still, being fair is undoubtedly advantageous and, seeing as I like desi girls, played well in my favour.

I'm only concerned with this racism, as it interacts with England and the natives.

As to ""colonialism"" that's just bs excuses for that envy and lust. It gives license to feel entitled, as if they own you personally. When 90% of the time, you were helped by the British Raj, as it hurt my people, the actual former elites.

We actually fought the British, we actually had most of our fortunes confiscated (escaping to Bengal, with enough servants, employees and manpower, to build a few villages and begin rebuilding ourselves). Your average desi was a peasant, marginal and ignorant of his condition. The British instituted universal education and brought industry to the middle class, rather than as hobbies of the elite (which is why industrialisation grew in Britain first, even though there were shoots in Bengal, too).

This technically tracks with the notion of piracy and freedom of choice, but it does create a rift in the player base between those that want to prioritize combat/conflict and those that are seeking completionism/unlockables. 

I often ponder the idea of then adding the Sea Dogs as an emissary in Adventure Mode to balance this out. Where advancement in the emissary could be centered around combat points rather than loot acquisition. Bring over some of the arena rules (you get emissary points for shots hit/ships sunk), add a victor‚Äôs trophy (like an emissary flag but specific to the dogs), and build in some mechanics to tamp out damage farming and spawn camping (ex. If you fly the sea dogs emissary you can‚Äôt repair other crews ships, or there is a damage point cap, etc). Additionally the Sea Dogs idolize, above all else, the glory and honor of combat.

Firstly, whether intentional or not, you have just downplayed the atrocities of the Nazis. The Holocaust, the second world war, and the terror that the Nazis brought should never be summarised as 'a bad decade'. Also, the Germans also sought to play the Empire game; so your claim that the Germans 'had a bad decade' is offensive and ignorant of the facts.

Secondly, British and English are not the same thing.

Thirdly, by focusing on the English, you are revealing an ignorance of how involved the Scottish were in Empire building. The Scottish had an extraordinary and disproportionate (based on population) impact upon the Empire.

Fourthly, you seem to imply that the British Empire was unusual in some fashion. It wasn't. The British Empire was simply larger and more successful than its rivals in conquering new territories, extracting wealth and resources, and funneling that into the industrial revolution. There is a reason why so many of the technologies we take advantage of today find their origins in Imperial Britain.

You should check how the Belgians treated their subjects in the Congo before trying to claim that the British Empire was somehow unusually different.

Finally, what was also just another Tuesday for the British was the abolition of the African slave trade and the dedication of significant resources in achieving it. It's interesting how easy it is to cherry pick facts to suit an agenda.

Like, I hate to be crass, but how uneducated are these people? I understand that being Greek I have some privilege in mythology being even taught at schools to a small extent, never mind parents at the very least giving the basics to children (mine were awesome and got me a small library of stuff on it) but like... The game sledgehammers you in the face with Greek mythology references in Bastion and the Maw, many names are literally just modern Greek given names. 

And there's more than Greek things ofc, e.g. a lot of Ardenweald is as I understand Celtic in inspiration. But okay, I'll go further, put aside the mythology stuff. Have these people... never played another fantasy video game, haven't they played D&amp;D, read a book, *anything?* WoW afterlife is, I'm told, also heavily influenced by D&amp;D style afterlife, except it's less about godly patrons and more about worldly deeds. Still, I keep seeing this, for lack of a better word... ""hyper-spiritual"" notion of the afterlife, which gives me a vibe of a rather closed-minded Christian-based view of things, which across history has hardly been the singular view of the hereafter. 

Again, to retread on the Greek thing, the Underworld/Hades was populated with shades, which I always had the impression were a bit like the disembodied souls you see in Shadowlands, see: weekly Maw quest and Bastion. The shades were usually insubstantial and ""dumb"", as they had drunk from the river Lethe and were forgetful and ignorant of their surroundings, *but not always so.* With ritual and offering you could get them to eat, talk -- and prophesize -- and more, and in some views they had what could be seen as a regular life... in death! And so many of the world's belief systems have revolved around active material afterlives, reincarnation, things we see in the game!

In WoW, which is a universe with known planes/dimensions, why would you expect (!) life after death to not have some material substance? 

I am more annoyed with the ""death is meaningless"" bollocks you see getting spewed around though. Never mind the fact that people have made a mess of things in their heads re: death in WoW &amp; Covenants (and Blizzard bears some blame for that IMO) thinking that they should make their choice based on where their character or class (sigh) would go, a lot of people seem to think that knowing what awaits kills the idea or fear of death, or that their future lived actions are irrelevant, things the game **directly refutes.** *There are people today, IRL, who believe to know what awaits them.* How is death meaningless to them?!",1628560056,"the shades were usually insubstantial and ""dumb"", as they had drunk from the river lethe and were forgetful and ignorant of their surroundings, *but not always so.","forgetful and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"forgetful and ignorant","forgetful",NA,NA,0

You really can look at the individual circumstance and make an assessment. In this circumstance, many people, not just me, took offense to an author going out of his way to suggest a HEA about stolen magical kids was just like an historical event in which indigenous kids were stolen from their families and placed with white families, and another historical event in which kids were stolen from their families, institutionalized, and a lot of them died. Many people also took offense to his American-centric assertion that few people know about this event - I learned about it in school. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Canadian unaware of this issue. Claiming it's a little-known historical oddity when it's one of the most important historical issues affecting Canada today, and people living today, who attended residential school themselves, or were stolen from their families, or had parents who grew up with PTSD because of the abuses they suffered in residential schools, is massively insensitive and ignorant of the author. 

I think the book itself is a fantasy plot that is totally separate from the historical incident, as I said very clearly in this article. Many have read this book as a fantasy unrelated to historical atrocities. My problem is that the author went out of his way to connect his book to indigenous genocide multiple times in interviews. In this article, I'm saying that I personally will never read this book because of that connection, because it is too upsetting to me. I'm not telling anyone else what to do. 

But I don't find a response that tells me ""it's not a big deal, get over it"" persuasive in the least. The responses of some his fans elsewhere on social media, quite frankly, is alarming. I've seen them  attack indigenous people who have a problem with his comparison, and use indigenous people who liked the book to silence indigenous people who didn't appreciate the genocide plot point. The author has issued no statement indicating he understands why people are upset at his words appropriating indigenous genocide in his fantasy book.

&gt;What I want is some evidence that what the Orthodox church teaches today as the same as what was taught in early Christianity. I don't think that's unreasonable.

Simply: early christians were able to hold and preserve the traditions. History is clear. The evidence is their existence itself. Is like asking if pur bible is preserved over the arguments of muslims who claims it has been corrupted. One simply sees history. Christians were able to compile a canon and preserve it.

&gt;Wouldn't that suggest that the council of Rome's canon isn't the same one used by early Christianity?

Yeah, those were heretics. Good luck wanting to defend congregations that used gnostic texts that treated God the Father as a demon demiurge.

Simply is the historical truth. Regardless of doctrine/denomination.

I did. They dont use 5 solas to make up protestant doctrines.

"h7yxpp7","The Ethiopian government enacted a unilateral ceasefire just to avoid this from happening. If you check the humanitarian reach after the ceasefire, you'll see that reach has improved immensely and that the only thing that needs to improve is aid delivery. The Ethiopian government urged TPLF to stop engaging in war and to let people farm, but TPLF ignored it and continued on an offensive. Allowing people to farm is crucial because the current aid funding is not sustainable. But TPLF main concern has always been their power which is why they've disregarded their citizens' needs and continued their offensive.   
Also, multiple Amhara reporters, which have reported on their territorial losses and the current situation in Amhara, have reported that TPLF forces recently killed 100s of civilians. Although, take it with some grain of salt. But I just wanted to bring it up to further emphasize the fact that the current depiction of the war is horribly one-sided and ignorant of the background.

The whole school, along with the teachers and parents will be affected by this if we accept that this is the moral action. If you zoom in on a part of the system, effects might seem to be positive overall but we have to consider what happens when we zoom out.

Second, they don't take time into consideration. The effects of bullying might bring more pleasure in the short term but what will be the effects in the long term? We are social animals and not 100% rational. What will be the implications if we accept that bullying is moral because in the short term it seems to bring more pleasure overall? What will the affected people learn? How many people will be affected in the long term?

If there were only 20 people in the world who were all infertile (isolation) and 19 of them bully one to maximize utility consistently (time), then their actions might be moral, but notice how this scenario is kind of useless. All models are wrong but some of them are useful. Examples that are too isolated and ignorant of time don't model anything useful. Still, they might help us to understand what actually we are trying to find. We can inspect them and try to find what parts of them are useful and what parts aren't. 

Last thoughts on the topic. Trying to find the action that brings the most utility is impossible. We would have to take practically an infinite amount of parameters into consideration and stuck in a state of inaction, calculating indefinitely. This obviously doesn't maximize utility. This means we have to estimate, and to estimate more accurately we have to find more accurate models of our world and actions. We have to consider if we choose a strategy that seems to increase negative utility ""too much"", it is possible that we might have overlooked a strategy that creates more utility because it also minimizes negative utility. I think maximizing pleasure should not be the only goal, we should also try to minimize negative utility, maybe we should focus on the latter part even more.",1628247151,"examples that are too isolated and ignorant of time don't model anything useful.","isolated and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"too isolated and ignorant","isolated",NA,"too",0

&gt; &lt; Intriguing business (in more than one sense of the word) about this Stamets character's dealing and doings vis-a-viz - a certain long-dead close 'colleague' of his Dr Stephen Pollock (co-discoverer of Psilocybe tampanensis)  &gt;

One more thread (these don't even scratch the surface of what's ""in the files"") this one stacked to the ceiling with heaping helpings of uniquely damning info.  

But first - a word of thanks whether requited or not to OP-mod u/Zealousideal_Belt_17 - for refrain from any mention whatsoever (despite what the cat drags in ""Stamets"" had to go there) - of a certain notorious web of malignantly cheered 'community' disinfo narrative.

Code name BLOOD SPORE.

And now that acknowledgment is duly made for not having touched that most malignant of all the noxious disinfo out there  - the thread 

www.reddit.com/r/Psychedelics_Society/comments/in45oc/suspected_cult_leader_and_enabler_of_child/ (info posted there comprises an entire case file dossier just about - snippet, sampled):

&gt; All four corners of Schlesinger's 'Cain/Abel' map of 'the vast majority of murders' - map directly onto every detail in the unsolved 1980 murder of Paul ""Cain"" Stamets' underworld rival Dr Stephen ""Abel"" Pollock, discoverer and owner of *Psilocybe tampanensis* (like an ultimate jackpot he'd hit) - . &gt;

&lt; a professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City Univ of New York, Schlesinger has studied the minds of killers for decades... recently completed a major research study with the FBI [on] crime-scene behaviors of some 37 serial sexual murderers in relation to 162 victims &gt; http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

&gt; The 2013 Narrative of St Paul &amp; Hamilton (whether 'useful idiot' or knowing willing accomplice) Morris - uses the exact same diversionary ""tar the innocent to whitewash the guilty"" tactic already used in a 2011 narrative - by Stamets' Evergreen State Mycology-gate 'partner in mycological crime' Michael (shudder) Beug

&gt; Relative to how a murderer, or accessory, might try 'gaming the police' (to throw off an investigation) - as noted by Schlesinger:

&gt; 1) &lt; *The perp hires a detective* [or 'journalist' - Morris] *to solve the crime* **in order to throw suspicion off himself**... *to strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it* (**the same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police**). ‚Ä¶ an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was abused like this &gt; https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy  

&gt; 2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameup &lt; In US criminal law a frame-up or setup is the act of framing someone [i.e. an innocent party, by]... to falsely prove [i.e. stage an appearance as if] someone else is guilty... incriminating the innocent might be done out of sheer malice, but *framing is primarily used as a distraction.* Generally, **the person who is framing someone else is the actual perpetrator of the crime**‚Ä¶ Frameups often use conspiracy theories to hide the true crimes &gt;

The scapegoating a ""patsy,"" ideally someone 'expendable' like pinning a murder on Poor Dead Pollock on some dastardly cops - is basic time-""honored"" method - for whitewashing a perp. 

To manipulatively 'acquit' some slime ball perp by staking out an 'innocent' claim with fleece as white as snow - is ""all good."" But the Mary's Little Lamb whitewash step is only half the job. 

Next comes the tarring of a ""fall guy"" - aka a ""patsy"" framed to take the blame.

It's the first thing they teach in Bait-And-Switch 101 aka 'blame shifting.'

&gt; ""The mystery has lasted long enough""

"h77k769","Okay. I see where those low iq ch0des come from, and I'd like to stand my point. I am a 17 year old Hindu, ""upper caste"" (I hate the term), General student. My friends from middle school came from all sorts of background, which I was unaware and ignorant of, since every single one of them shared the same privileges as me, growing up. I only noticed the religion difference since my Christian friends would get gifts on the 25th and I used to be invited to the evening feast for Eid in my Muslim friends' homes, while all of us would gather at my home on Diwali. The very first time I came across something called caste, was the board registrations in I guess 5th grade, when my teacher (of whose I was a favorite) told me it'll be 10 times harder for me to succeed than my other Reserved category friends. Trust me when I say, I felt in my 11 year old innocence, my community was the one being discriminated, because I'd never seen the heinous and terrible derogatory treatment the other category had to face. 

I'm NOT saying casteism is not real, or vanished from our society. I remember my Father's friend who is from the reserved category speak of how ill he was treated as a child. His son, who studies in my class, just like me has only heard of those struggles his dad faced. He never faced anything on face. We belong to the same economic strata. He, a ""lower caste"" (fuckin hate this term) knows of casteism only from books, just like me, an ""upper caste"" (ugh).

What do you mean? Did you mean to say ""hurtboxes""?

&gt;have UNREACTABLE GRABS THAT DEAL MORE THAN HALF YOUR HP

""Unreactable"" grabs are only triggered when at very close proximity, meaning the player is at fault for purposely misplacing themselves. 

&gt;This game is actually pathetic when it comes to encounters.

 Ninja Gaiden -both Black and Sigma- is one of the very few actions games with such a high quality of enemy encounters that the community still religiously replays the campaign and its mission modes.

There are no ""rose-tinted glasses"" when, unlike almost ever other action game you could even think of, the player base thoroughly enjoys the same combat scenarios. NG's challenge runners and Karma runners remain active a decade and a half after the game's release.

&gt;It regurgigates so many bad mechanics and unfair things at you to make itself hard that its ridiculous.

You contradict yourself: is the combat system ""good"" or are the mechanics ""so bad""? Your definition of unfair is quite shaky; of all action games, NG -Sigma or Black- cannot possibly be accused of unfairness. What are you comparing this game to? Which other action game on the highest difficulty is ""less unfair"" that Ninja Gaiden?

I would have expected you to mention the revised aiming controls for the bow, which are objectively atrocious in this release of the game and a considerable downgrade from the PS3 version; have you really finished MN and not pointed out that the Radio Tower is a barely functional combat scenario? Strange. 

&gt;make the game hard just for the sake of claiming to be hard

This statement reeks of someone who does not understand that Ninja Gaiden Sigma is a re-release of a 2004 game. Back in 2004, developers could not expect players to be able to control the camera while playing at the same time. How is it possible that so many people forget this? Did you not play videogames back then?

Camera angles during bosses were not design for difficulty, but to maintain action under control. This is the fundamental logic behind locked-camera scenarios: if the player cannot affect the angle, the developer will always know what the players is actually seeing, allowing for interesting design without relying on the player using claw grip. Again: this game was released when most players could not even control both sticks at the same time while pressing face buttons. 

Indeed, the camera can be an enemy by itself during boss encounters, but this was intended to harm players, but to help the overwhelming majority of the population would could barely use the right joystick. 

&gt;Getting Master Ninja Rank is just spamming UT's and hoping to god you manage to close the encounter fast enough.

Quite reductionist and ignorant of the disinterest of the community regarding ""Master Ninja"" ranks. Scoring -known as ""Karma running""- is far more complex than ""spamming UTs and hoping to God you manage to close the encounters fast enough"". Which other ranking system are you comparing NG's to? I can guarantee you those systems have massive holes and, as such, their communities do not hold any value over in-game rewards.

The line ""(...) hoping to god you manage to close the encounter fast enough"" is specially ignorant. Sadly, Sigma does present a handful of, to this day, impossible time limits, but it is, for many, the preferred version of the game for scoring precisely because of the shorter time limits which result in less farming. Do you understand the concept of farming when scoring as an overall problem of the play-style? Do you understand the implications of time limits for Ninja Gaiden and for scoring in general? Do you know what score drop-off is and how lacking it affects point-chasing? It's easy, from a new player's perspective, to believe ""Master Ninja"" ranks are the endgame, but that could not be further from the truth. A simple ""Master Ninja"" rank score is not even close to being a competitive score.

I believe you see ""Master Ninja"" ranks and ""SS"" ranks in DMC3 and that could not be further from the truth. 

&gt;artificial difficulty bullshit

I was expecting to read this, you did not disappoint. I could understand such a statement in reference to the original NGII -which you will not play-, however, when used when discussing NGS I cannot but chuckle.

"h6wce4f","I think your interpretation of those established FF themes relating to ""not blindly following orders/dogma and trusting in the power of people over supposedly divine power or uncaring rulers,"" is close to my understanding. However I don't think XV is the antithesis of that idea.

One, **Noctis is the True King.** Meaning everyone: the bros, Luna, the Six, Regis and the old kings, trust in and follow Noctis. I'll explain.
 
The True King's power or Providence is described by Bahamut as *""a power greater than even that of the Six.""* This power is the only way to end the immortal Ardyn. Meaning the Six *cannot defeat Ardyn alone.* Using the True King's power involved absorbing the power of the Crystal (*End of Ch.13*), the Kings, and the Six(*Both during the game and culminating in the ritual at the finale*). The Crystal is described as holding the soul of the Star; meaning by the end of the game Noctis held the souls of the entire planet within him and was able to direct it to his will. 

&gt;Merriam-Webster definition of ""Providence"" 
&gt;1 a *often capitalized* : divine guidance or care
&gt;   b *capitalized* : God conceived as the power sustaining and guiding human destiny

XV's Providence is Noctis's Providence, he borrowed the power sustaining the world and guided it into scourge Ardyn's face.  Moments before the kill-shot we see Regis and the Chocobros in a classic ""My friends are my power"" frame. Noctis implores Regis to trust him before unleashing his power. 

Two, **Noctis wasn't raised as the True King.** Meaning, Noctis was not raised as Yuna was in X. He was left to be largely carefree and ignorant of his true duty or responsibility. Noctis is not driven by his dedication to Bahamut or the Six, instead he's pushed by everyone's faith in him. He doesn't really even understand it, in fact it pisses him off (See first royal tomb, his surprise in Ch. 12 at Luna's hidden feelings). Why should others give their life for him, he wants to save everyone, he doesn't want to lose anyone else. That's his motivation throughout.

Now, quickly, onto Nyx and the Lucii. The question asked of Nyx of who to sacrifice for power was a trap. The answer is no one. Only the selfless are worthy of the power of the Lucii. If you are tempted by power like Luche you burn to a crisp, if you do it to save your sister with a hint of revenge you lose an arm. Now why would the power only be given to those willing to die to protect others? We see how short lived the full power of the ring and Crystal are. I will have to dip into the FFXV Ultimania Scenario Side because all the lore guide in XV says is that the Crystal ""*has a will of its own, and channels its sacred power through the Ring of the Lucii to the monarch who bears it*"" 

&gt;I'll put the beginning of the **Prologue from the Ultimania**
&gt;The Star was being quietly eroded.
&gt;It is not even clear when it began, this Encroachment/Erosion of Darkness. Infested with the horrifying creatures called ‚ÄúShigai‚Äù [Corpses/Daemons], the world is slowly but steadily being swallowed up by a night of despair.
&gt;The Star had a will.
&gt;It is a powerful shining stone„ÉªThe Crystal was created. 
&gt;There were six-pillar-kami in the world. The Six, as they were called, created a ring to allow mortals to tap into the magic of the Crystal.

The closest FF analogy I can think of for the True King is from FFVII; where a person could theoretically sit in the confluence of the entire Lifestream and become God. The will of the Crystal is the will of the Star, the one that Noctis is able to direct to save his living friends in memory of his dead friends.

*Now why did Noctis need to do this? Why be so protective of the Crystal's power? Why require selflessness?*

**Ardyn.** The immortal guy described by Bahamut as a straight up fool in the JP localization, saying his mind was ""twisted by spite and bent on revenge,"" in English. According to Bahamut in XV, Ardyn is immortal *because* he took in the scourge and tried to use the Crystal only to be rejected. According to Ardyn, he wants to kill True King Noctis (*holding the soul of the planet inside him*) because Ardyn was killed by the Lucian King of his time. Yes, explicitly killed in JP. Ardyn was killed then in his 2000 year bout of hatred and anguish corrupted the world and brought the darkness. Sound like someone else who couldn't handle rejection or mortality? 

Maybe Garland from FF1. Maybe Xande from FFIII? Maybe Kuja from FFIX? Maybe Yu Yevon and Yunalesca from FFX?  Maybe Buhnivelze from XIII? 

Facing loss, rejection, and death is tough; as natural as those things are. It's not great to lock thousands into a never-ending dream in order to preserve them from death while damning thousands of others to the tyranny of a dream powered kaiju in the hope of saving those people the pain of war. Working with others on a realistic solution is better, **accepting those painful elements with the joys of life in mind** is better than **selfishly rejecting everything** in a nihilistic murder spree.

Lastly, JP Bahamut tells Noctis he will have to abandon the future joys of life in order to unleash his power - this is better to me than the line about ""many sacrificed for all... so must the King,""  because it's not supposed to be about coercion. Bahamut's revelation was easy mode, for Noctis to sleep, think things through himself. We saw Noctis's actions after waking, but we shouldn't forget what he tells the bros atop the stairs.

"h6t26at","Yeah he was a trip, all around.  One of like only 3 or 4 really sad folks I ever knew in 10yrs.  Fuck it, story time, here's a rundown:

* *poopy pants kid we've been talking about,* nuff said 

* *The idiot weirdo-thief that couldn't drive* - **idiot** Fresh from tech school airman, first job is learning the vehicle he's assigned to, first step is vehicle familiarization - tasked to learn three numbers: 3,000gal water, 500gal AFFF, 500lbs dry chemical agent.  Aided in task by twice daily familiarization checkouts with the entire crew including the NCO/civilian crew chief*(FD)*.  Over two weeks of duty later and he had yet to recall those first three familiarization items/numbers.  **weirdo-thief** While deployed several of us living in the flightline fire station had started ""losing"" sets of PT gear.  Disappearances got so bad and far up the ranks that the entire station was raided by the NCOs, including locked lockers.  This dude had stolen like ~15 *sets* of PT gear from A1C's to TSgt's, much of which wouldn't fit him and all of which was marked by the owners with laundry tags.  **couldn't drive** This airman drove his sedan to work and backed it into a parking space every single day.  When his training finally*(much later)* reached Driver/Operator, he began to drive cone courses on the ramp daily.  This is designed to make you accustomed to driving gigantic heavy crash-fire trucks and prepare you for actual vehicle license testing.  He had no other problems, but he could not back up to save his own life.  He turned the wheel wrong way every single time, I'm talking 5 times in an hour everyday for a couple of weeks or more.  He backed his car up daily, but couldn't understand a fire truck is exactly the same just bigger, and always turned the wheel the wrong way.

* *That poor sheltered kid* - This young airman was the type who was quite sheltered and ignorant of the world.  I want to be clear that there's absolutely nothing wrong with innocence, it's simply a truth relevant to the situation.  TDY to SE Asia that provided ample free evening/nights and some bar-scene to spend them in.  We all know how some of those ""bars"" can be, and how they really work.  This guy didn't, and never understood why this ""waitress"" was so enamored with him or that he wasn't *really* buying her overpriced watered-down drinks or ever dreamed that there was a connection between that and her going home with him.  A week or so after returning from TDY he was heartbroken and down because the lovely girl that showed him the world suddenly had no interest in maintaining contact.  That was about when the situation changed from a possible teasing hint here or there about what the reality was, to a deadpan serious sit down talk with his closest buddy and his supervisor.  It never became relevant at that level for me, but I decided then that when I became an NCO I'd be sure to expose young airmen to knowledge about the bright and dark sides of the world they were about to face.  Poor dude, I mean it was kinda funny to us young'ins, but it also wasn't and was sad in a very real way.

* *The incompetent MSgt* - New MSgt PCSd in and fairly quickly took over as one of the shift Assistant Chiefs, as per usual.  Though I was an NCO at this time, I was never privy to the specifics of why he was quickly removed from the position and ""demoted"" to Station Captain duties - generally assigned to TSgt/SSgt.  Within a couple of months he'd demonstrated the inability to do what amounts to scheduling and babysitting.  He was now put in the Crew Chief's seat on a truck - generally assigned to SSgt/SrA.  Several training fuck-ups over a few weeks later and he was placed in the Driver/Operator's seat on a truck - generally assigned to SrA/A1C.  In less than a week he had backed the [Engine](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/6c/d8/096cd8ab46c2e815288e8c4db8e95cd0.jpg) into the Fire Chief's command vehicle*(SUV)* - **twice**.  I was amazed watching him be position-demoted that far, but they stopped there and did not put him on the tailboard with the kids fresh from techschool - the only lower position left.  They invented a new ""Assistant Chief"" position*(Special Operations)* and sort of *went along* with the idea he'd expressed among some of the station that he was just being familiarized with our station, SOPs, people, and equipment simply by refusing*(properly)* to address it.  The newly created position's primary duties consisted of what were previously minor duties of the MSgts in other sections*(Training, Supply, etc)*, and they always looked over his shoulder - hell I*(SSgt)* was even tasked a couple of times with ""checking his homework"" so to speak.  The thing is - he made rank because he retained information extremely well, perhaps he would have made a good academy instructor, he simply could not perform under any semblance of stress or something.  He was always a klutz fumbling hands-on things as well as mental.  In a practical application sense he was incompetent.  How he had ever passed practical evaluations as he progressed, I can only imagine was a tragic disservice done to the AF by some prior NCOs that didn't care enough to fail him - or maybe something had happened to him that affected him in such a severe way... who knows.",1627459119,"* *that poor sheltered kid* - this young airman was the type who was quite sheltered and ignorant of the world.","sheltered and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"quite sheltered and ignorant","sheltered",NA,"quite",0

Obviously there are rarely identical reoccurrences in history (literally cyclical to the point of being identical copies) but, as you say, a set of conditions that generally results in similar outcomes.

My memory is hazy on the book but it tended to focus on the theme of:

- great societies came about by asserting their dominance via the sword (for example, the Arabs exploding out of the Arabian peninsula and coming to dominate the complacent Middle East, despite the Arabian peninsula being a relative backwater)

- they reach a crescendo of power (once there is, for example, no more drive to expand). Martial strength is praised and held in high regard by these societies

- peripheral powers eventually rise up and bring about the downfall of the dominating power, the dominant powers having become too introspective and ignorant of the dangers on their frontiers

2. If the old app works well with Wine (which obviously you would determine before moving to it), it'll do so transparently to the end users - so anyone trained with the app will still be able to use it just as they do on XP.

Nice Pablum to start your second paragraph. Your troops are ready for combat when you can lead them in combat by them wanting to be lead by YOU in combat. Once that occurs, hitting all the exercise and readiness checkboxes will just occur. Develop potential, that is rich given your statements. maybe to you potential is only for promotion or being slotted in succession planning. Quite a few think that way, far fewer of them are leaders in any manner that doesn't involve the stick of rank and NDA. NEWFLASH, the CAF is an UNDERSTRENGTH volunteer force, if you think that means less room for the lazy or incompetent, you are delusional and ignorant of the history of the profession of arms and leadership. Your next about how your in your unit you characterize them is pretty telling, so I will just let your own words tell the tale. To the correlation you made between improving their circumstances and deserving of being leaders. You mean promoted? Officers that so strongly connect rank with leadership, have too much of the first and no real understanding of the second. Your defensive posture of being worried about getting grieved for writing what you think you should is interesting. Cowardly, bureaucratic and really, by the time a troop reads their PER, if there are any surprises, especially bad ones, then you have failed as a leader. So awesome to hear you keep up on the paperwork and make sure quarterly PDR's are accomplished, while showing some righteous anger that ""it's a rarity"". Who are you making sure they get done for? Those you like and YOU to say ""BUT, I do the PDR's!!, LOOK AT ME!"". If you haven't figured out that leadership isn't paperwork competency, you missed your calling as an accountant. I am not saying that doing them is bad by the way, it's OK, but it ain't leadership. Leadership happens in interactions that aren't forma more than it does in formal process/procedure systems.

This makes absolutely no sense. Fisher is not a desirable brand. You could have bought replacement, fully working Fisher stereo components for less than $200. Why would you pay a repair shop more than the stuff is worth in working condition?

Another example is your typical Funai VCR. There is absolutely no reason to pay $100 to have one repaired when you can buy a working one for under $50. It's rare to find anyone that will fix one. Repair shops know it isn't worth fixing. Repair shops know that Funai designed their VCRs to be thrown in the trash and didn't design them to be easily fixable.

Repair shops know all of this, they know you're sentimental and ignorant of the economics of repair, and they're happy to take your money from you. They won't tell you to throw your stuff in the trash and buy another from eBay for $50, they'll recommend you pay $200 for the repair.

I support right to repair and I support repair shops, but ONLY the repair of very high value items. I'm a fan of VCRs, but 99% of VCRs should not be repaired because it's not economical. Try to open your own VCR repair shop and you will instantly go out of business, because you can't make money fixing most VCRs.

The tutorial took me to the market to buy something in Buildings that wasn't even there - every choice was shaded out and there were no new choices - and then just left me there. I had a bit of a time getting out and still had no control over my game cuz the tutorial wanted me to finish but had unfortunately not given me any way to finish. I wrote to support w the problem and they wrote back a few hours later saying that they had taken care of MY problem and I could go ahead and play again. Not a word of explanation or apology and frankly I felt them calling it MY problem was disrespectful and completely off the mark. Obviously the problem was Decca's, some kind of glitch in THEIR programming which meant THEY hadn't devoted the time to program then check out that programming for bugs before they released it. The whole thing seems kind of slap dash to me and then to say it was MY problem and not even apologize for tying up the game for so many of us just seemed lacking in respect for their players. So does doing such a half baked job in the first place.
I'm grateful that Decca took over Dragonvale when Back Flip closed but I think they should show some respect for us the players. It seems like they r so pushy in their business model. They push ""special events"" down our throats even though there r persistent complaints about the neverending ""special events."" How ""special"" can an event be if it goes on and on and is replaced by a new ""special event"" the minute the old one ends. Something is special bc it is uncommon. Since Decca took over Dragonvale it's much more common to be in an event than to have time off from one just to rearrange, redecorate, whatever -  just to ENJOY your park w/o pushing for points every day. Now they're so anxious to push a new way of doing things onto us to increase their own rewards that they can't even take the time to do a good job on it,  program it well then check it, try it and screen it for glitches so it runs smoothly for us. No they have to push it out there, another pushy thing that they push too hard and too fast on us for their benefit. Then when it doesn't work bc they pushed it out so hurriedly they tell me they've fixed MY problem. I guess I'm supposed to be grateful and ignorant of the fact that THEY caused MY problem. They don't explain and they don't even apologize. I really love playing DragonVale so when I first started writing this I thought it was just going to be a little complaint about not knowing what was going on but as I wrote I realized that I have been bothered about how little respect I feel they show us and our complaints.

"h58j0i2","**Skip down to the tl;dr if you don't want to review.**

MCU, among other adaptations of the Marvel ""Extended"" Universe have always played fast and loose with the omniversal nomenclature. 

One thing we know is that the TVA/Miss Minutes party line is a lie. Their understanding of the nature of the ""Sacred Timeline"" is at best incomplete, and at worst, a complete fabrication with only coincidentally coinciding information.

At the end of time in Loki, we do see what *appears* to be the Sacred Timeline and the Castle at the End of Time with He Who Remains at least aware of various incidences in multiple timelines, possibly multiple universes. We also see what appears to be the Sacred Timeline diverging once ""the threshold"" is reached.  This coincides with the readouts at the TVA in **an alternate *universe*.** (one where Mobius doesn't recognize Loki-199999-B).

However, no one's version of how the omniverse works is credible. The TVA are brainwashed, the Loki's are not trust worthy and ignorant of how these powers beyond them work, and He Who Remains is manipulative and quixotic.

A single timeline spawning branches continuing into alternate universes, complete with Lokis being born different genders and species, as well as a TVA in which Mobius, an interchronographic Loki expert, doesn't recognize Loki-199999-B, only makes sense if branches start at the beginning of time.

We know *a* quantum realm exists in a way that within it, a person can travel both back and forward in time. We know that messing with quantum time travel can accidently pass time through a person, rather than a person traveling through time. And we *know* that going back in time and making changes does not affect your native timeline, but that, at least with removing an infinity stone, one timeline can diverge from itself. (if you believe what the Ancient One tells Bruce)

The Ancient One also tells us there are multiple **dimensions**, and Dr. Strange traveling through them and Dormammu existing in one is good evidence that she was correct.

We have evidence that someone from one timeline can live a lifetime in an alternate timeline and then return to a point in his native timeline. (Captain America couldn't have stayed in his native timeline to return the stones and hammer and then live his alternate life with Peggy, because you can't change your own past)

Finally, we have some conjecture and rumors about MoM and NWH, most notably that people from Earth-10005 or Earth-TRN688 are going to show up in Earth-199999 in NWH. (and Earth TRN688 already showed multiversal crossover in Into the Spider-Verse)

*There's other info on this subject that's no longer canon to Earth-199999 like Agents of Shield in an unnamed ""Earth-ABC"", and Earth-616 has not had any crossover to Earth-199999, so we can't use the comics as guidelines.*

Given what we know and what we think will happen, I'd say it's reasonable to assume that ""alternate timeline"" seems to be synonymous with ""alternate universe"" only once the timeline branch passes ""the redline"". Before that, they are only ""alternate timeline branches"" and can be pruned. (the people directly pruned, go to ""the Void"" and the the rest of the timeline branch, spacetime fabric and all, get remerged into ""The Sacred Timeline"" via the use of ""time bombs"". Once a branch passes ""the red line"" it becomes an unpuneable alternate universe that can interact with Earth-199999 and cause a multiversal war. 

The One Who Remains maintains this timeline through the TVA pruning branches to prevent alternate The One's Who Remain from existing in a multiverse and waging interuniversal and chronographic warfare, but we know that other universes exist in the Marvel Multiverse, including those already mentioned, and that these universes can interact with each other.

Importantly, branches can occur at any and all points in time once the timeline is no longer being maintained by The One Who Remains. So infinite branches starting from the beginning of the universe have formed. The TVA exists outside of time in its home universe, but not outside of its universe, and an alternate universe that must have branched and red-lined before Loki was born (965 AD) and Loki-199999-B was accidentally sent there instead of his native universe.

The quantum realm is either a bridge between the main timeline and alternate time branches (if the events of End Game were not big enough to redline either the past or present that can be remerged with the prime universe) or a bridge between universes that have not existed in the metaverse until **""now""**, but ""now"" that they exist, they have *always* existed.

**tl;dr**

**The Omniverse** includes Earth-1218 as well as all fictional universes and alternate histories, including all, canon and non-canon, Marvel universes.

**The Metaverse** includes all Marvel and Marvel-connected universes; including canon and non-canon adaptations and media, the Fox Marvel Universe, the ABC Marvel Universe, The Sony Marvel Universe; all universes included in adaptations including Earth-1610, Earth-90214, etc.; and including Marvel properties like Malibu Comics universe, etc.; and including an Earth-1218 analogue. There are multiple Metaverses such as the DC Multiverse and the George Lucas Multiverse (Indiana Jones, Starwars, etc.)

**The Multiverse** includes all Earth-199999 universes; including Phase I-‚àû canon properties, and the alternate universes (unpruned timeline branches that became alternate universes after passing the redline in 2023, 2012, 2013, 2014A, 2014B, 1970A, and 1970B) The Avengers diverted off the main timeline in End Game. Multiple Multiverses exist within the Metaverse including the Earth-10005(Fox's X-Men) multiverse and the Earth-TRN688(Sony's Spider-man) multiverse. These multiverses may interact with each other as well as the universes within them.

**Universes** are contiguous, coherent, and canon properties. Fox's X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand, along with the Wolverine trilogy are in one universe, but Fox's X-Men: First Class, X-Men Days of Future Past*, and X-Men: Apocalypse are in another universe. Universes exist within a multiverse, but, like in the case of Days of Future Past and Deadpool 2, can interact with one another. We may see multiple multiverses as well as individual universes interacting in NWH (Maguire, Garfield, Holland), and very likely in MoM.

**Timelines** are divergences from a main timeline in a universe,  but that are pruned before reaching the red line in variance. Loki-199999-B and Loki/Sylvie come from the same universe, but separate timelines/branches. The TVA also exists within its universe but not within a timeline. The main timeline of Earth-199999 is essentially all the MCU mainline movies as well as WV, F&amp;WS, and most of Loki.

**Dimensions** are part of a timeline. Multiple ""dimensions"" exist both in the main timeline and in a branch, though it's possible that dimensions are also on the same level as a timeline and are both not affected by timeline branches, and can be bridges to alternate timelines or universes, like the quantum realm does.",1626321370,"the tva are brainwashed, the loki's are not trust worthy and ignorant of how these powers beyond them work, and he who remains is manipulative and quixotic.","worthy and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"worthy and ignorant","worthy",NA,NA,0

"h4v7gtb","&gt;I said ""de facto"", not ""de jure."" Either you don't understand what de facto means, or you are intentionally misrepresenting my argument to make it appear invalid.

So, if you're not familiar those are legal terms, saying something is ""de facto"" means that the law recognizes it as the situation that actually exists even if it's not codified. So no, the west bank is not ""de facto"" part of Israel because that would require some court of law anywhere to treat them as such. The fact is that de facto annexation is not a thing that exists, anywhere, it's not a thing.

&gt;Non political violent crime is not always related to the stability of a country. You wouldn't call the united states an unstable place for having a high violent crime rate. 

Ummm... I'd say it indicates the level of personal security a normal citizen has. 

&gt; Political violence on the other hand, is directly related to the stability of a country, as political violence specifically seeks to destabilize a country and force it to react politically, economically, and socially to the violence. While you are right that one shouldn't be fearful of going to Israel and dying in a terrorist attack, that isn't what I am claiming. What I am saying is that the fact that Israel suffers regular terrorist attacks from a territory which it occupies which directly borders it, is an important factor in considering the stability of Israel.

You'd be correct if there was any chance the Palestinians could collapse Israel.

&gt;Israelis die in more than just those widespread uprisings, and they die in numbers that far surpass the fatalities of the United States. I already established that. I can give you the numbers year by year, if that's actually necessary.

Yeah... again, you're trying to view deaths from terror attacks as something that's uniquely significant when looking at a countries safety/stability. Hell, the amount of murders in the Israeli Arab community alone eclipses the amount of people killed from terror attacks most years.

&gt;I would argue that many would use the term ""stable"" to refer to a country that does not suffer from regular internal conflict, terrorism, and political violence. Internal conflict and political violence are direct factors in the likelihood that a government will be destabilized or overthrown, and so when people say that a country is stable or unstable, they are generally looking directly at the political violence and terrorism in that country. This is why the primary data that statisticians usually use when looking at political stability or instability is violence and terrorism.

&gt;And it is why Israel ranks 155 out of 194 on the political stability index.

Which shows how serious these rankings are. Israel, despite these low rankings has survived for 72 years with the same system of government and without any major collapses. above it in rankings you can find a host of countries like Brazil and Argentina which had military coups which then collapsed back to democracy in that same time period. You can also find Jordan which is a country which is literally dependent on Israel for water and couldn't sustain its internal consumption if Israel collapsed. 

&gt;Secondly, even if we take your definition to be true, which I do not: I would argue that regular violent conflict with occupied territory on a country's immediate borders is an obvious risk that a country might not prosper or sustain itself into the future, or that at the very least there may be some significant unwanted political change on the horizon that would significantly alter its current situation.

Would you have the same analysis of Britain during the troubles?

&gt; Your assumption that Israel will continue to prosper in the future strikes me as both overly confident and ignorant of the history of political violence and insurrections.

I have no idea why you think that Israel would not given its own history and the fact that it is now more powerful than it ever has been.

- Why not all lives (in a non racist way). Yes All lives matter tends to be racist people saying it but there are many people that do think BLM is more about black supremacy than equality. There are outspoken black people that push back on some of the supremacist aspects of it (Terry Crews being one of them). You can see it coming up with the Stop Asian Hate stuff (you will see BLM people pushing saying SAH takes away from BLM) and also with how nobody related to BLM gave a damn about the anti semitic shit floating around the NFL.

- People can't stand the justification of the rioting and looting. The idea of ""it's just property"" or ""insurance will cover it"" is pretty simplistic and ignorant of a lot of reasons why that might not be true.

- Criticism that it's over applied. In some of the instances the people killed by police were in fact violent criminals as evident by witness testimony and forensics

- Black on black crime is a really popular one. Statistically speaking you're many many many times more likely to be killed by a black person as a black person. There's little attention to this and defund the police is considered naive by many as police departments are currently overwhelmed in stopping these crimes.

"h4ph0fa","&gt;I suppose the ideas I'm discussing are not necessarily Christian, that I will concede, and that not all Christians would agree with me. 

Many christians are also scientists, so i would imagine that many of them would disagree.

&gt;I think you understand I am talking about ideas and science that support the biblical narrative. 

I figured, yes. You mentioned intelligent design and proponents of ID tend to also be proponents of flood geology and the like, but I don't know specifically which ideas you support here - so I asked.

&gt;The topic is why are Christians afraid of science, but I'm saying they are not, and that the efforts of bible-believing scientists are considered not simply out of the mainstream, but also even as a danger to society, and thus worthy of suppression by the scientific community, which has become a veritable priesthood of our modern society.

The thing that OP is talking about is almost certainly how certain groups like Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research, etc... portray science.

These groups are dishonest and ignorant of science because their interpretation of scripture puts them at odds with apparent reality. 

They even have statements of faith on their website that state, in their own words, they will reject any scientific findings that conflict with their assumptions - they're essentially proud of their own blatant bias and they are essentially claiming *themselves* to be infallible in their interpretation.

I've had their articles presented to me as evidence many times and I can say that every one of them has either misread something in a scientific paper or taken a quote out if context (in a way that you would have to either do so intentionally or otherwise be horrible at reading comprehension), or even blatantly lied about what a scientist or scientific paper said.

In the end, these ideas are not 'covered up' by scientists, they're given the same treatment as flat-earth or ancient aliens - they aren't supported by the evidence and so nobody takes them seriously.

Just like those other groups, AiG and ICR will claim they're being censored, that there is a conspiracy in science to silence their ideas but in reality, they can't defend their ideas scientifically so they [pound the table](https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/3840x2160/324637-Carl-Sandburg-Quote-If-the-facts-are-against-you-argue-the-law-If.jpg) and lie to their followers.

Christians are very active in science though, most scientists in the US are christian and their ideas are considered just as well as their other colleagues. Many major scientific concepts were discovered or proposed by christians as well. 

&gt; Fundamentalist Christians are not alone in this area. Some years back, a film was made to illustrate how science suppresses such views. It got little air time in theaters or otherwise. Why?

"h4p4nkw","I cannot answer your question directly because I feel the same but have no faith in anyone who prolongs prohibition of cannabis.  To call them ignorant and completely out of touch with reality is just scratching the surface.

Honestly ive always approached cannabis here as if the prohibition did not exist.  Without being obnoxious about it of course.  Ive always been respectfully honest with people regardless of what their job may be(employer/police officer/etc) and the response has almost always been equally respectful and understanding.  Its interesting how often a mutual interest is expressed!  

It hasnt happened in many years but in my younger days mostly there were easily more than 20 instances where i was found in possession and technically could have been arrested and charged.  only twice did it happen.  once in highschool(rightfully so) and the other incident involved my rights being violated and would have been dismissed had i not been young and ignorant of the laws.  Almost every single other time the officer understood and could identify with my position, ""having been young before too"" and would sometimes ask for me to dispose of only some of what was in my possession while knowingly letting me go on my way with the bulk of my stash.  Now I have no need to carry more than a small amount(not that it should matter) but I am also not an asshole to cops even if we dont see eye to eye with each other.  Theyre just on the clock like anyone else at work, just doing their job(usually).  Which is exactly how they deserve to be treated.  As a human..  I would assert my rights probably less than i should have but i honestly dont believe i should have to over any plant, especially that one. Im stubborn like that but why shouldnt I be?

People tend to forget how important that plant was in this country at one time.  The founding fathers used it. Taxes could be paid in it at one time.  Im pretty sure there was a period where you could be fined and thrown in jail for NOT growing it.  ""Hemp for victory!""  Its history provided all the evidence about its safety and efficacy for medical uses since Ive known about it.  It almost seems as if anything negative about it was always either a lie or a result of being lied to and improperly educated of its effects.

Now if none of the above is news to you and/or you just get it, I want to share a hypothetical scenario intended as food for thought and nothing else.

What if people began another one of those viral internet ""challenges"" involving everyone on social media posting a video of themselves doing silly things for a cause..  except base it on self incriminating about what amounts to having a plant you like that your not supposed to have.  maybe even share a little about why you use it. If you were to make a video of yourself using marijuana in an average setting, what would it look like?  walking out back, taken a couple puffs off a pipe, then heading back inside would be pretty boring and very common.. These days mine would literally be just me swallowing a dropper of liquid a bottle as my coffee is brewing in the morning. If I didnt speak, absolutely nobody would know the illegal activities that precede all others every day.

the point being, to highlight the subtlety of it all openly and hopefully to people who might gain that perspective from seeing such videos. Some pretty boring stuff really.  

This alone could potentially gain attention, maybe enough for change but eff that.  Why not BE the change?  Say  the ""challenge"" includes  a statement made declaring ones self as not being guilty of any illegal act and further more making a promise to and encouraging anyone who may one day face any legal issues related to cannabis to PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

Why people plead anything else to any charge they fundamentally do not align with is beyond me but they do all the time. So did I for too long.  This is why marijuana is not legal here. If more court dates are needed with reschedules and jurors being picked causing increasing overall time spent just because a plant then that all costs.   As it stands, everyone pleads because its quick and easy and profitable for the laws to remain as is. 

In all seriousness which is more likely for someone employed in politics to do...  react to your need for an illegal medicine or the courts need for a larger budget to run less efficiently/effectively?

Im sure there are absurd directions people can take what ive said and run with it as a way to diminish the point here but to any of those people I still say that its any persons right to stand up for whatever weird behavior they believe in.  In the end though, what is accomplished with this approach all really comes down to economics.  Is it economically feasible for a court to take even a large number of marijuana cases to trial.  It is not.  They wont do it.  If you dont believe this, simply try pleading not guilty to a minor traffic violation some day and see what happens.

Damn that was way more than I intended to write. I am not proof reading that. Lol

"h4o9cl1","&gt;Question #1 Biased
For any reason, why do you feel that that a piece of art of which no minors were harmed in the creation of and has no connections to the real world is wrong or should be banned everywhere?

For me personally, it's not about the art, but who created it and who indulges in it. Unfortunately I've stumbled across some very extreme loli porn - some where the character in question is obviously made to resemble a toddler. (Japanese preschool frocks, baby clothes, etc.) I just find it to be a red flag that someone would take something like child rape and then twist it into something ""kawaii"".

Also just to note, I live in Canada, and here it is actually illegal to possess loli porn. In fact, last year, a man in Windsor was arrested on child pornography charges due to this.

[Article](https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/windsor-man-faces-child-porn-charges-due-to-cartoon-animated-images)

*However, the Criminal Code of Canada‚Äôs definition of child pornography includes ‚Äúany written material, visual representation, or audio recording that advocates or counsels sexual activity with a person under the age of 18 years that would be an offence under this Act (Section 163.1 (1).‚Äù

Thus, non-photographic images can potentially be considered child pornography under Canadian law.*


&gt;Question #2 Personal
Explain why you feel that is so important to hate on something (or even just care about it) if it doesn't affect you personally or the people around you, why do you value morals above rationality and enjoy forcing said morals onto people? (from an outside onlooker like me, this is simply what I see your groups situation as, let it be known that I don't really see r/AntiLolitary's situation as any better)

As mentioned, I've stumbled upon very extreme loli porn. In one instance I saw someone comment how he would love to see his seven year old neighbour do these acts. While I personally don't believe everyone who enjoys loli content is a pedophile, it would be very naive and ignorant of us to say that NO ONE is.

Also, speaking as a survivor of CSA, it does negatively affect my PTSD seeing any depiction of a child being raped.

The Taliban also banned Pashtun culture as well, such as the attan, Pashtun poetry, archery and so on. Essentially anything yet viewed as unislamic.

Additionally Zoroastrianism isn‚Äôt the religion of Afghanistan, before Islam the people of Afghanistan followed multiple religions.

The region of Herat and its surrounding areas were Zoroastrian. The urban people and elites in 

Kandahar were Zoroastrians but many of the village and valley people followed various iranic  cults and minor  religions. 

In Balkh the religion was  both Buddhism and Zoroastrianism but also other smaller religions.

In kabulistan Buddhism was the main religion, with smaller Hindu sects ( Suryism) , smaller iranic tribal religions and Turkic religions.

Zabulistan the people followed various iranic/Indic cults and religions but the two dominate ones were Buddhism and Zun/zunbil while some worshiped The fertility goddess Nanna.

In the northern regions ( nurestan, Kunar and parts of badakhshan people worshiped pre Hindu - Vedic religions the ones that the Kalash in neighbouring Pakistan follow today.

"h4jaqtz"," I think California may be a two party consent state. I'm really not sure. But yeah, it's ridiculous.

 The problem with society today (my own, personal theory) is such: Society is incapable of empathy anymore, and our values are being destroyed.

 To break this down further: We are a polarized society (globally, not just as a nation).

 It's evident that a majority is conservative and liberal. We rely on media, and social media, to form our opinions, instead of saying ""you know what? I want to look into this for myself, and form my OWN opinion.""

 The media on both sides has an agenda (I think Al Jazeera news is one of the least biased), which they push. Both sides only reveal one side of the coin. In my opinion, this is despicable, and disgusting. Because you're knowingly misleading people. The effect of this results in hatred of the other side, and violence, and what we see today: division. (I personally believe we are VERY naive, and ignorant of things we can't see: ie, people, extremely rich people, with lots of power driving this agenda of one-sided narrative, for their own greed, and gain. Playing both sides against each other on purpose.)

 So, what this ties into is this: We are incapable of saying ""you may be right, I'm curious now. I'm going to research xyz (ie, recording laws... which really isn't that hard to just fucking google 'my states recording laws'), to find the truth myself.""

 People don't want to put in the effort to study anymore: The internet will give me the answer! But the problem with the internet is this: You're going to find the answer you're looking for (basically, you will be able to find an answer that you WANT to be correct, and fits your perspective) 

 The trouble is this: there is so much info on the internet that it takes that hard work, that internal drive, that curiosity, and eagerness to find the actual truth (God forbid we didn't have the internet, and we had to get that truth by going to the library and reading!!!!). But we've become lazy because of the internet, and tech that does things for us.

 As is mentioned early: We don't like facts (rather, we don't like learning things which would REQUIRE us to do research to discover that truth.) 

 Add on top of this the fact that we are intolerant: We don't care about other's opinions, and what they have to say, I'm right, and you're wrong. Schools don't teach debate anymore: We rely on feelings, instead of facts. We don't discuss our points of view from science-backed positions. Instead, if you disagree with me, that makes you __phobic, and a __ist, nazi.

 And those that DO quote actual facts are tuned out by babies who just hold their hands over their ears, shut their eyes, and kick and scream like toddlers. 

 Basically, the future generations are screwed, and society is going down the shitter because of puppet masters pushing a hidden agenda, and they're doing this to keep us ignorant, and uneducated so we all don't wake up and start asking questions about what's really going on and take back control.

I find it quite telling that my suggestion that people spend a couple of hours on youtube watching professors of CRT profess is met with derision.  

It's almost as if those pushing CRT want people to remain ignorant.  Goes right along with all of the schools that have tried to hide the curriculum from parents I suppose.  Little tip if the position that you are advocating for requires the ignorance of the general population, you position is probably problematic.  

There's a elements of the pro-CRT push that I find interesting.  First there is the plee of ignorance.  For some reason those advocating for CRT just aren't quite sure what it is, but they are sure that it's not what I'm saying and they aren't to interested in taking the time to find out for themselves.  

Second is denial it is happening.  These parents going to their school boards don't know what's really going on, they've been misinformed.  What they've been told is not what CRT is about and they are bent out of shape for no good reason.

We shield ourselves from the realities of death and grave injury. The media keeps us safe and ignorant of the brutality of existence. In entertainment media, death is either prettied up or so over-the-top it borders on parody.

In reality, death isn't pretty, and it usually isn't quick. The body fights hard to stay alive, even beyond any hope of long-term survival. The pain and suffering isn't always the most horrifying part. It's the futility of the body's struggle to maintain function. The ones who die instantly are the lucky ones. In many instances, if not most, people take a long time to die.

So why do we need to know this? Partly because we need to face the reality and inevitability of death, and that it could happen to anyone at any time. Also, we need to realize that death is not dignified or pretty. It's brutal and ugly and we need to do everything we can to put it off as long as possible.

"h44v8sc","The clamor for a KIng was unquenchable.  A King can mean a number of things.   Basically two things:   (2) a better connection to the Godly, just like an higher invertabrae have spines (ha!) and brains, and cells that are seperated by cell walls, the core of the cell seperated by a another wall, seperaable organs dedicated, each, to a few main functions, and the brain seperated, and above all, by the awesome blood brain barrier membranes,  then in the brain at the deepest spot, very well mechanically protected, the ""limbic"" tiny organs, which connect body and brain, and likely body, brain and soul, somehow.  

So God structures things.  Structures primordial man, the man.   The concept of human, and in all aspects of human, which in broadest brush includes all creation, this creation, for the whole of creation was structued for man to Lord.   And the structure of man includes emotional, political and social, linguistic and economic structures, all having a ""holographic"" nature, each to the other, were to some deep extent, strong or weak, but deep, each reflects the whole.  So every cell of a man's body knows the other cells, as we see in organ transplant rejection, for the body, each part of it, knows it's own.

Samuel warned them, all, of what a King would mean.  Becuase a King involves a risk, like the risk of a compass needle mislabeled, where a  ship's master might sail southward meaning to go northword.   So too with a King.  Shall we use the King as a circuit breaker, a buffer, between ourselves and our God?  That we may more easily do our OWN thing, our own multitude of things, including things that endanger ourselves or others?   A King is helpful in this regard, as the King then becomes like an object, one we may scorn or obey.  Now the King, evern so, if we scorn him, and follow not his order -- in this case to which I address you, the ""Doctor"" -- we likely will have a penalty, for the King gives advice which is presumably, like the Brain in a bodies, the best thing for a body.  

Samuel explained:  The King will tax, the King will take our most appealing children, the King will order us to war.   As a doctor may order a major and very risky surgery.    

Why do we want a King, to avoid God, or to join to the Godly purposes we are made to be King of?   

What is the purpose for which one gives such Kingship to a Doctor?   To stay willful, and ignorant, or to be closer to one's own health in knowledge and behaviour?   It is easier to pay a lot of money and then not follow the advice!    One feels that one has done the proper medical thing!  One has pressed the right buttons!   As the great Persian Doctor Rhazi ""felt great pity for physicians who took care for the well being of princes, nobility, and women, because they did not obey the doctor's orders to restrict their diet or get medical treatment, thus making it most difficult being their physician.""

Should the doctor be such a golden calf of a King?   Many doctors in history seek only that form of doctoring!   

A King must, if good, walk amoung the people.   But the people, must also not feel so seperate and ignorant of the doctor, once the fee is paid.

"h40s35l","Scanlan is in a deeply unhealthy place at the time of his exit, using drugs as a coping mechanism to deal with his sense of inferiority and self loathing, which is the root cause behind his inability to open up about himself to his friends, because he does not have a high enough opinion of his own self worth to think his friends could accept him if they knew everything about him, the exact same reason he avoided Keley for so long. 

Given that he was incapable of resolving his issues in a mature manner, leaving was the correct decision, especially to repair his relationship with his daughter (though remember that Scanlan's inital plan was to run away, give himself away to vices and drown himself in sorrow and fall into a never ending pit of despair and self loathing, and that VM's advice to be with his daughters saved Scanlan. Without VM's help I doubt Scanlan would have ever returned to VM, he probably would have died in a ditch of a drug overdose, or from a king hit in a bar fight) However, this does not mean that Scanlan or VM were without fault. It was a messy break up, born of dysfunctional people incapable of understanding how the other was feeling.

Scanlan's ""why the fuck would you do that"" was a very clear establishment of boundaries which VM had over stepped/ignored. That was good by Scanlan. But following that with ""you don't really care about me"" was a statement which escalated conflict, invalidated VM's feelings about Scanlan, and made Scanlan sound dismissive and ignorant of their care for him. But honestly, Vax's anger is the one which escalates the conflict the most, invalidating Scanlan's concerns and calling him an asshole. Vax is right to make it clear to Scanlan that his previous comment hurt him, again establishment of boundaries. But the aggressive tone ruins that and makes Scanlan ignore Vax.

Saying that VM has never done anything for Scanlan whilst listing the other things they've done is to ignore that all of those sidequests were done hunting vestiges, not to help everyone with their own issues. And it's also to ignore that Scanlan doesn't need help fixing daddy issues with his parents like the rest of VM, because he has intentionally detached himself from caring for anyone else except for VM, and therefore has no past that needs to be helped with.

""Scanlan has none"" is to ignore that Scanlan sabotaged his chance at a relationship with Pike due to his own ignorance of Pike's boundaries, a fact he admits in later episodes upon his return.

VM not knowing Scanlan's mother name is not an example of VM being neglectful. As Vax points out in later episodes, it's an example of VM being respectful of Scanlan's boundaries rather than intrusive/invasive. Scanlan never felt comfortable with opening up, so they didn't pry because they had been friends for long enough that they trusted Scanlan to talk to them if he needed to.

Scanlan is self destructive, and a master liar. The two combined means he avoids confrontation by lying, and never resolves his issues with his friends, for to do so would place him in a vulnerable position and he doesn't want to go there.

Whilst VM made mistakes in that final confrontation before Scanlan leaves, those are all the results of Scanlan hiding his failing mental state from VM. VM were completely ignorant of Scanlan, not because they don't care about him, but because Scanlan doesn't care about himself. 

Scanlan is doing the best that he can, and he's failing miserably. And that's what friends and family are for. Because you cannot solve your mental state on your own, and you need a sufficient support system when your best isn't enough. Scanlan couldn't do that until he had left VM and spent time with his daughter. Realising that his daughter accepted him for who he was and didn't abandon him when she found at all his flaws gave him the self respect to be open with his friends. Scanlan needed to leave, and all of the party were better for it in the end, and it was no ones fault.",1625405566,"but following that with ""you don't really care about me"" was a statement which escalated conflict, invalidated vm's feelings about scanlan, and made scanlan sound dismissive and ignorant of their care for him.","dismissive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"dismissive and ignorant","dismissive",NA,NA,0

"h3ron6r","I think this discussion about how the setting is or isn't post-apocalypse kind of points out one of the things I love about the setting of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (and its inspiration, Roadside Picnic, really good book) is that the Zone is sort of a living thing.  It's like an event that keeps happening; the C-Con and the emissions and such result in an area with its own hazardous sort of ecosystem that has a sort of mind of its own.  Between lab experiments, radiation, mutation, and the political layer of the Zone, it's like a self contained world inside the outside world, a world that is in an ongoing state of apocalypse.  It's like the outside world, nervous and ignorant of what the Zone could be, is in a perpetual pre-apocalypse, with the Zone being an ongoing apocalypse that is ever changing, never predictable, never tamed, and so it is always dangerous but at the same time always bountiful, a place of true opportunity and chance; it's a paradox unto itself.  One could say that it's also the genesis of many things, such as strange artifacts that can do the impossible, leaps and bounds for science, wealth for those willing to take risks, and so on.  So maybe ""half apocalyptic"" is more appropriate when you think of it that way.  Someone's life in the Zone may end one day while another's fortune is made the next.  The Zone itself kind of reflects this, given it seems to be in some sort of equilibrium, not growing but not going away either, the fear (depending on your faction) being that it might one day be gone forever or go the other way and consume the world.

"h3khxja","Congratulations! 

It indeed sounds like you already are in a healthy ddlg relationship!   
As you said, I would also think that your partner is already aware of this, at least to a point. It seems strange to me that he never brought it up formally, when you are so receptive to it! 

Maybe he is also just familiar with the lifestyle, but not the labels and terms?

I was in a similar situation, where I have always wanted more than a normal relationship. But whenever I tried to incorporate part of what I was longing for, it was sometimes perceived as being clingy and overly protective. I was also very confused and ignorant of the terms ""daddy"" and the ""ddlg lifestyle"". 

I had bad experiences with multiple partners in the past that mainly involved punishments and degradation, all while they have been wanting to call me daddy. I was not into that. In my mind I had made up that this must be all there is to the ""daddy thing"". I had ignorantly assumed that every relationship like this would involve the things I did not like, and that it was all there was to it. It really did turn me off and away from the ""daddy"" moniker.

When I met my current partner I even told her that I ""was so glad she wasn't into the daddy thing"". Fast forward to about a year later and I am now her daddy and I have learned that there is so much more to the word, the lifestyle and the dynamic than I knew.

I like the way you describe what the word ""daddy"" means for you. I feel exactly the same. In our relationship and dynamic it is also not just sexual thing. It has a much deeper meaning, with me taking care of her and having her as my first priority in almost all situations. It is a sign of trust and deep understanding. It means her being vulnerable and me showing her deep, unconditional love and affection and taking care of her.

This is what I wanted. I wanted a dynamic that goes further than a normal relationship, I wanted to be daddy and didn't even know it. 

I still think back to what I felt and assumed the ""daddy thing"" was all about and I feel ashamed of how ignorant and uninformed I was. I am incredibly grateful and happy that my initial negative knee-jerk reaction did not make her turn away and that she taught and showed me what it really means to be in a ddlg relationship. 

It is now an integral part of my life and I would never want to miss it again.

Sorry about going on a long personal tangent about my own feelings, I just felt inspired to write this when you explained how you are feeling with your partner because it resonated well with me and how I feel.

"h3h70wa","Sunnis are not kafir but your conclusion is wrong.

&gt;Because the way i see this ...sunnis have always been on the safe side. 

It's not ""safe"" to remain Sunni just because no one will call you kafir. It may be safe in this dunya but it's not safe in the afterlife.

Sunnis can't be considered kafir because you are generally unaware and ignorant of the command Allah gave us all as Muslims to follow the Ahlul Bayt. Sunnis don't follow this command, but they are not kafir because they didn't know any better. It's like if someone has been taught his whole life to pray 4 times a day instead of 5. He's wrong, but he's not kafir because he didn't know any better, he was ignorant.

But imagine that person praying 4 times a day was put in a position where he could learn that praying 5 times a day was really what Allah commanded. He'd have to start praying 5 times a day, if he stayed only praying 4 times a day that'd be a problem.

In the same way, if you are in a position where you can learn that following Ahlul Bayt is the command of Allah, you'd have to start following them. To keep ignoring them would be an issue.

I as a human cannot judge you. Maybe you are ignorant. Maybe you were never in a position to learn about Ahlul Bayt. Maybe your mental capacity is limited to the point that doing the necessary research would be impossible for a person of your capacity. Therefore as long as you say that you are Muslim I cannot say otherwise.

But when Allah is judging you on the day of judgement, He has full knowledge. If you claim ""I didn't know you commanded me to follow Ahlul Bayt"" he will have knowledge of whether that's a valid excuse.

Maybe Allah will say ""you were ignorant and had no way to know any better"" and will forgive you. Or maybe Allah will say ""you should have known better, I gave you an intellect capable of finding out for yourself, and I gave you access to the internet so you could do research"". And maybe Allah will punish you for not using the resources He gave you.

A competitive market will necessarily have winners and losers so some businesses will fail and some will grow but the system never resets after that happens, so established and successful businesses will necessarily have a head start on their competitors. Large businesses could also manipulate the government and use it to pass legislation that benefits them at the expense of smaller ones. New technology, new kinds of capital, that businesses require to stay competitive is often expensive which means that only people and groups who are already wealthy can afford it. There can still be upsets in the market due to disruptive innovation and alike but, for all these reasons, I don't know how long such a small business or small proprietor economy would last before falling into an arrangement not unlike what we already have now.

As for commodity production, I do get that it's existed for a while but it wasn't generalized until rather recently. It was when commodity production became the basis for the economy, rather than just a small part of it, that capitalism came to be. Under such a system, no one really sustains themselves anymore so everyone requires different inputs and outputs. Essentially, labor is social because each person has to sell the product of their labor so they can buy the product of another person's labor. Under capitalism this is indirect, though, mediated by market exchange. There seem to be three options to me: capitalism (labor is social but indirectly so), socialism (labor is directly social), or distributism (labor is individual once again). My issue is that I don't know whether this can be sustained. For reasons I already mentioned, the market tends towards monopoly and, unless we're abandoning technology, we're not gonna be able to produce everything on an individual or community basis. 

I'd be interesting in hearing some of your broader criticisms of Marx, by the way.

As for the question of planning vs markets, I think I'd make your exact argument but in favor of planning. Yes, the economy is very complex and interconnected, so why do we leave economic decisions to uncoordinated, disconnected actors, like in a market? Because there are no real structures for firms to communicate and coordinate with each other, the market is wasteful, unstable, and ignorant of the adverse effects it causes except when they eat into the bottom line. I also don't think planning requires concentrated power, it could just be coordination between free and equal producers, the kind of thing distributism seems all about!",1624980900,"because there are no real structures for firms to communicate and coordinate with each other, the market is wasteful, unstable, and ignorant of the adverse effects it causes except when they eat into the bottom line.","unstable, and ignorant","ignorant","and",TRUE,"unstable , and ignorant","unstable",NA,NA,0

Biggest difference is that ""wokeness"" is just awareness, its not a national policy with the explicit aim of removing colonial influences(since the US hasnt been a colonial subject for like 300 years and even then they were the settlers, not the displaces).

The methodology isnt close at all, because the Cultural Revolution was a closely coordinated removal of narratives to provide state propaganda and ""reactionaries"", alongside centralizing the education system from the disparate warlord systems.

And Mao wasnt a Marxist. He ditched Marxism as a dogma, since Marxist practice doesnt let agrarian societies try socialism.

"h2zroun","I also know homosexuality to be a sin. But I don't believe you're thinking about things in the right way (and you're repeating things that everyone has heard). By speaking like this, you seem very hateful and ignorant of the gay community. Scripture warns us against arguing, and also teaches us fruits of the Spirit. None of those fruits are bad - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Approach all situations, especially sensitive subjects such as this one, as Jesus would and with these fruits in mind. 

Many people twist or ignore scripture to live the way they want, don't get me wrong, but think about things from another perspective. Some people *honestly* believe homosexuality is not a sin. Why is that? From my experience, a huge argument is that the word ""homosexual"" was somewhat mistranslated from the original Scripture. My understanding is that many scholars have studied this and determined that homosexuality in Scripture was referring to another sexually immoral act - men having sex with boys. Due to the nature of biblical times, men lying with other men was probably very uncommon and not a major issue - whereas men having sex with slaves/servants (who may have been younger) was. So I see this being something we should take into account. I understand the argument and can see why it makes people believe that way, and can make those who aren't very firm in their beliefs very skeptical of the Word. You have probably heard this argument before, but I encourage you to really listen and try to understand. 

Now, while that argument is an understandable one, I believe the stronger argument is that the act of homosexuality IS a sin. The Bible talks over and over again about man and woman and defines what the sacrament of marriage should look like. And, frankly, man and woman just makes sense naturally. Each make up for what the other lacks mentally/emotionally/physically. 

Approach any discussions about this with the fruits - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Some people honestly believe homosexuality is not a sin, and some people do believe it's a sin but still practice it (and still believe in God). It is our job as Christians to be disciples of Christ and to speak about these things, but it is also our job to do so in a way that shows compassion. We should love everyone. I truly believe Christ would have sat with gay people as He would with other sinners. That doesn't mean He condones the way they live, and that doesn't mean He would talk to them constantly about their sin. Show them His love and mercy. 

Imagine living your whole life only being able to be sexually attracted to someone of the same sex. I believe people are born gay, but I believe this comes from Satan. I deal with temptations of my own, and I am beyond thankful I wasn't born with those desires. I believe it is a sin to act on it, the feelings themselves are not sin. We all have our own burdens, and just like I appreciate and need encouragement and love to overcome my sinful ways, so do those in the gay community. 

I hope you read this with an open heart and mind, OP. The world is wicked, but we must show compassion to spread His love.",1624627849,"by speaking like this, you seem very hateful and ignorant of the gay community.","hateful and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"very hateful and ignorant","hateful",NA,"very",0

"h2ufm1e","This idea that if everyone just wore n95 masks then things would have worked is just silly. Check out what happened when Bavaria and Berlin actually did mandate n95 masks. https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1407419457467678724?s=19. N95 masks did no better than the regular cloth and surgical masks used by the rest of Germany at stopping covid, and neither were successful at slowing covid transmission in the least bit. Cases spiked regardless of mask wearing, just like what happened everywhere else on the planet. Masks have utterly failed everywhere they have been mandated. 

The problem with masks isn't just that they don't physically stop viruses. For n95 masks (or really any type of mask) to be effective, they have to be used properly. They have to be properly fitted and sealed to the wearer. They need to have minimal adjusting and touching. They need to be thrown away and replaced many times during the day. And their potential effectiveness is pretty much lost as soon as they are used outside of sterile, controlled, settings like hospitals. This notion that we just needed ""better"" masks is laughable and ignorant of reality. Mask mandates are built on absurd assumptions about human behavior and a wildly incorrect understanding of how covid actually spreads. 

Masks only make sense in a world where humans who are actively sick always go out in public (even during the most publicized global pandemic in modern history) and routinely cough and sneeze directly in the faces of strangers. They never cover their mouths and go out of their way to be as close to other people as possible. These sick people go to the store and wipe their infected snot over anything they can get their hands on. And then those people who were coughed on, don't wash their hands or do anything to avoid being coughed on. At the same time, in this ridiculous world, every man, woman, and child could potentially be an asymptomatic carrier of sars-cov-2. So these people, who are not coughing, sneezing, or showing any signs of being sick whatsoever, still must cover their nose and mouth, because just their regular breath is so saturated with coronavirus that it's potent enough to turn any public place into a super spreader event. This is not how real humans behave or interact with others, but it's this type of behavior that masks are trying to stop. It's insane.

Your example doesn't really work. It's not like cloth masks are like porous mesh condoms, and n95 masks are like impenetrable latex condoms. Cloth masks are still like mesh condoms, but n95 masks are more like triple layered spandex condoms or some other fabric not meant to stop sperm. Mesh condoms don't work, but neither do triple layered spandex condoms. Both don't work, and the potential protection that they provide is negligible compared to nothing at all. You would be a fool to rely on either condom to prevent unwanted pregnancies or stds. And this especially true when the condoms aren't used correctly or at the right times. Masks (cloth, surgical, n95, or otherwise) were not designed to stop aerosolized, respiratory viruses. They are simply not the right tools for the job. Masks are not effective at stopping highly contagious, respiratory viruses. Never have been. Never will be. Even when high quality, properly fitted, regularly disposed of, masks are used by trained medical professionals in a clean hospital setting, their effectiveness is minimal at best. But mask mandates aren't about requiring trained medical professionals to wear masks. No one takes issue with doctors using masks. Mask mandates are about requiring every human being on earth to wear an objectively ineffective piece of cloth over their mouths whenever they are out in public regardless if they are sick or not. This is absolute insanity and I honestly can't believe there are still people trying to insist that masks make sense and work to prevent viral spread. Everywhere in the world easily shows this to be laughably false, yet people are still twisting themselves into knots to figure out how to justify their use. It is easily the most ridiculous thing I have ever experienced in my entire life.",1624504049,"this notion that we just needed ""better"" masks is laughable and ignorant of reality.","laughable and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"laughable and ignorant","laughable",NA,NA,0

"h227742","It sounds like you are describing yourself as being agender, though I am not trying to label you as that‚Äôs a wholly personal matter.

What‚Äôs frustrating reading this post and particularly your comments in it is that you seem either unwilling or unable to imagine an interpretation of gender that differs from your own, however you categorize yourself, and are projecting your own relationship with the idea of gender onto others.

Even for cis people, gender is not something that can be clearly grouped into categories, whether those categories are based on genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, or anything else.

Gender is a social construct that has not even been consistent across human history or universally constant across different societies, because what it means varies specifically and crucially based on the cultural and temporal context of the individual.

Partially by design, modern society places significant emphasis on gender as a primary indicator of the available life paths and roles in society and the expectations society places on an individual. 

For many of us, those expectations and the interpretations they carry about who we are and what we are about don‚Äôt make any sense, and we feel that the label placed on us at birth based on our genitalia is an incomplete picture of who we are, the places we want to occupy in society, or the way we want to be allowed to interact with each other in a world that is by and large designed to force us to conform to specific, incomplete categories of identity while facing reprisal for refusal to conform.

The label we have for this is trans, meaning people who know ourselves to not fit into the gender we were assigned at birth. Some of us wish to transition into a presentation and role that fits cleanly into one of the main categories of gender as this fills the role we see ourselves in. 

Others of us feel disconnected from any desire to conform to any standard of gender, which may result in a concrete nonbinary identity, or it may be a fluid identity that changes over time or even based on the specific moment or situation. Others of us feel no connection to gender whatsoever, perhaps even to the point of apathy about how our presentation and identity are interpreted through the lens of the social construct of gender.

Whatever the case, the goal for most of us who fall into the general category of nonbinary identity is to separate ourselves from the expectations and qualifiers of any particular gender, and to separate the concepts of genitalia and secondary sex characteristics and presentation from the concept of gender and identity.

You may not care about that. You‚Äôve stated again and again that you feel gender is a concept that you feel no connection to, which is totally valid, and should be respected in whatever way would validate you.

I appreciate that you‚Äôre here in this sub looking for answers about why different people express or interpret their gender in different ways, as you have stated yourself you are in a process of questioning, which we‚Äôre here to help with and talk through.

What I don‚Äôt appreciate on the other hand is your apparent willingness to debate others‚Äô identities with them, and to categorize people into groups that are based on misguided interpretations of feelings of people outside yourself. 

It is unkind to project your own relationship with gender onto others and demand they take your interpretation of them seriously when it‚Äôs not a matter of discussion. In that same way, it would be unkind and ignorant of anyone else to tell you how you should feel or what your expression of yourself should be like.

Please keep in mind that none of us are here to be into yet another box based on our identity that simply doesn‚Äôt have enough room to hold all the parts of who we are. Most of us are here to specifically avoid that.

I assume this post and your comments have all been made in good faith and not as attempts to play the devil‚Äôs advocate against the basis of the sub, but you are coming off as judgmental and unwilling to listen to others.

The lesson you should take from all of this is, gender is not a science, and defining it as though it is is exactly the misguided philosophy that has forced so many of us to find language and concepts to express that we do not fit into the options presented to us or the labels that have been forced on us.

"h1xoon7","Yes, the poet was, of course, playing on the common association between ""dark"" things visually and ""dark"" things emotionally or philosophically. I'm fine with the association. What strikes me as too cute by half is twisting the questioner's obvious meaning, pretending not to understand what the questioner was asking...and using the entire poem except for the final two lines on that charade. The questioner's challenge is in no way addressed by pointing out that paper has ink, or that the moon is not always full. Or that there's something called ebony. Then, at the end, pretending to just ""get it,"" that perhaps the questioner was asking what nearly any adult knew the question was--and certainly every poet.

To be clear: The original question spoken of by the poem's title is not a remotely intelligent question: It's incredibly shallow and ignorant of both an important thread of human nature and a very prominent element of poetry--namely, the awareness of the dark and sad. It's the kind of question asked by always-cheerful people who don't appreciate melancholy. Yet much of the best poetry is melancholy in orientation or perspective...as is much wisdom and art and philosophy and psychology...and nearly every other arena that makes for profound living. So I have no sympathy for the questioner's question.

But having no sympathy for the question does not lead me to conclude that the poet should play dumb--dragging the intelligent reader through an obviously false interpretation of the question.

I would have respected the poem far more had it been honest. It could easily have responded to the question by (instead of falsely pretending to have misunderstood the question, and making the question seem even dumber than it is...pretending it was asking about dark colors) eloquently making the case for the value of the melancholy and the tragic or the absent or the fallow...or whatever else one may want to connect to the concept of dark. I simply don't see what being dishonest and cutesy added; indeed, to me it greatly detracted from the enjoyment and respect I experienced in engaging with the poem.

But, of course, if you have enjoyed the poem--as, along with many others on this subreddit, where it has garnered many hundreds of upvotes, it appears that you have--that's great. And I wouldn't want to change your enjoyment of it. My goal is not to impose my view on anyone else, but rather to share it...for whomever might find it illuminating. I do wish you well. May you continue to find much enjoyment and inspiration from poems.",1623819503,"to be clear: the original question spoken of by the poem's title is not a remotely intelligent question: it's incredibly shallow and ignorant of both an important thread of human nature and a very prominent element of poetry--namely, the awareness of the dark and sad.","shallow and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"incredibly shallow and ignorant","shallow",NA,"incredibly",0

2) The court‚Äôs job is not to correct bad policy decisions by the executive, but rather to determine whether or not executive policy is constitutional. There are incredibly specific requirements in the way that SCOTUS analyzes things as a result. Thus, the outcome of a case is not how legal scholars evaluate its soundness. SCOTUS reviews the law and determines what it allows for/requires, they don‚Äôt determine if the policy the executive enacts is wise, only if it‚Äôs constitutional. I have no doubt there was a great deal of trepidation within the court about the wisdom of such a policy, but the issue that would have been discussed is whether or not in war time/exceptional circumstances and national security threats, the powers of the executive extend so far as to allow internment of Japanese Americans. There was some basis for the concern, as several Japanese Americans played key roles as informants to Japan in battles such as Pearl Harbor, etc.

In the sense of all that, what lawyers look at as bad decisions are scenarios where the law is misinterpreted.

"h1ptmxk","What? Are you trying to say that I am jumping to conclusions? I am not. I am using your post as my evidence to suggest that you don't know how to interact with others. 

When you interact with another human being with the intention of finding an emotional connection, you start by *learning* about this person. This is a process in which *you* talk to them to learn about *them*. It is not a simple download of facts about them. It is a process in which you talk to them, you are interested in them, and you want to learn more. By giving us this ""presentation"" of who you are in a few paragraphs, you seem to be making the case that these things define you and you want someone who responds well to each of these things. This is problematic for two main reasons: one, no one can be summed up in a few paragraphs. If these are the most important aspects of your personality, it's highly likely that someone you could be compatible with doesn't correspond to them and therefore doesn't even try to talk to you. Two, you have demonstrated literally zero interest in another person's interests here. You only want someone that complements *your* interests, which comes across as extremely selfish and ignorant of how social interactions work.  


The reason I say it sounds like you have never spoken to another human being before is because I don't think you understand these principles of human interaction. Successful social interaction isn't based on finding people who like all the things you like. It's actually based on you finding things you like about others. And for the vast majority of human beings, those things aren't what philosopher they're currently reading. They're things like how they respond to differences, what kinds of jokes they like, what food they like, if they enjoy new experiences, do they prefer to stay in or go out more often, are they prejudiced against certain groups, what politics do they subscribe to, etc. These are the things that make us who we are. Favorite philosophers and whether or not you want kids are certainly interesting tidbits, but anyone who thinks that makes up anything more than a sliver of their personality is inherently boring and shallow.",1623667301,"you only want someone that complements *your* interests, which comes across as extremely selfish and ignorant of how social interactions work.","selfish and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"extremely selfish and ignorant","selfish",NA,"extremely",0

It is very easy to use too much especially when you consider the person doing it is likely untrained and ignorant of proper procedure.

Lastly, dealers only care about the bottom line and have no problems using untested and unregulated ""research chemicals"", many of whom are made in China. The last variable is the supply chain.

I was called cold-hearted and ignorant of the feelings of others more often than i can remember. Older family members called me a robot without feelings.

Reading the audience would be a good skill to apply in cases like this. While it's true that an accident can't be undone, it's also compassionate to recognize and validate another's emotional feelings, especially during times of distress. The word itself refers to taking on/sharing the burden of someone's pain. I can tell you as a mother that watching children get seriously hurt is distressful like no other kind of distress on this great, green earth. By stating technical facts only, you came across as unsympathetic, which I'm going to assume did not really reflect your beliefs about the whole incident. 

If you have trouble connecting with people emotionally (from everything from emergencies to having fun), that's not a factor of Stoicism but might be one of social skills, which like all skills are understood and expressed on a spectrum. If I had a genie in a bottle the first thing I would ask for is a comprehensive method to help people of all ages develop and improve social skills.

"h17nu91","At the minimum, your husband needs grief counseling and you and both need to schedule a visit with an obstetrician so the OB can explain to him on direct, small, simple words that he is wrong and ignorant of how pregnancy works. 

Lashing out when he is grieving is somewhat normal, although clearly not healthy or acceptable.  He needs to see a grief counselor and apologize to you directly for wrongly blaming you and lashing out.  

If your husband has a history of lashing out like this, you have a bigger problem, but if this is a change from his typical behavior, I would also suggest marriage counseling for both of you.  

Of course it should not be necessary for you to drag him to the doctor to tell him the obvious, but ... man, people are weird about how pregnancy is viewed.  Family folklore and attitudes get sublimated and ""everyone knows"" that X or Y is bad for the baby.  I once had a friend tell me I couldn't do anything that needed me to put my arms over my head because ""the cord will wrap around the baby's neck and strangle it"".  This friend was as certain of that truth as he was that the sun comes up in the east.  Nothing I said could remotely budge his opinion.  

Your husband clearly has some kind of similar misapprehension about how pregnancy works, that he picked up somewhere when he was quite young.  It's going to take a pretty significant level of authority figure to counter it. Yes, it is bullshit.  But humans aren't exactly always rational.

The blocky heads, exaggerated eye sizes and distance, along with overall smaller loli proportions are meant to serve the greater story of the anime. Whereas e7 caters to a semi-realism style. I think many who play e7 would agree that the art style is what drew them in the first place, esp. those who dislike the chibi gameplay of gachas like arknights or granblue. These players would prefer a more coherent artstyle, especially if the collab units are broken, meta first picks or BiS pve team units.

Or literally any of the democrat mayors who have allowed rioting and property damage to run rampant through their cities.  Where have they been held accountable?  

Let's be clear here, we can discuss this topic for a while but for you to conclude that it isn't ""debatable"" is ignorant, stupid, wrong and screams that you are not informed in any way.

&gt;What I think fox is doing worse, pushing that the election was false, without source or legal recourse, 

Well, maybe the democrats should have actually let the investigations happen and people wouldn't be skeptical.  Let's remind you why we're in this position in the first place.  Do you realize just how many lawsuits were dismissed prior to presenting evidence?  Or the Texas lawsuit where one of the dissenting opinions stated that this isn't a case that they can deny.  It then got dismissed on one side because it didn't have standing and another side because it was moot.  That is not going away.  If you think all of this goes away, it's not.  It's going to be a hundred times worse next election and it's because the cases were being dismissed prior to evidence.  Here's a fun fact for you, 21 cases have been allowed to present evidence in court showing fraud.  14 of those cases were confirmed to be fraud.  

Right now, there are democrats fighting tooth and nail to block the recount that is happening in Arizona.  Why?  If we have election integrity, then why is it a concern?  Everything that is happening to discredit the recount in Arizona is making it more clear that it needs to happen.  If the outcome of that recount is that it matches the actual election outcome, guess what happens?  People become satisfied even if they don't like the outcome.  The push saying that it's voter fraud diminishes.  

&gt;pushing that the storming of the government building was harmless, which is demonstrably false

1 person died and it was a protester who was shot by a still yet unknown officer and the video of the incident shows it as a homicide.  

The story about the cop who died was a giant lie from the start.  First media outlets like CNN claimed he died from a blunt force trauma saying he was hit by a fire extinguisher which was proven false when the facts came out that he died from a stroke at the precinct and no where near the protest.  Then the narrative got pushed that it was bear spray which caused the stroke which was then proven false when the coroners report came out saying it was naturally caused.  But that doesn't stop media outlets from still blaming that on the protest.

Meanwhile, you have politicians claiming they have PTSD from the event as they try to politicize it even more.  They tried to impeach Trump because they tried to claim he was inciting people by telling them to peacefully protest.  (Quick reminder, Maxine Waters faced zero repercussions from Democrats when she told people get more confrontational and to stay on the streets.)

Worse of all, the continued lie that it's an ""insurrection"" despite literally no one being arrested for anything even remotely close to actions related to an insurrection.  That's not stopping left wing media outlets from continuing to push that narrative.  

&gt;pushing that less taxes for the rich will help the economy, 

Sometimes I get reminders like this that people have no clue how tax revenue works.  Here's a fun fact for you, after the tax cuts happened, tax revenue increased.  

&gt;Obamacare would create death panels to kill your grandma,

Sarah Palin is still relevant?  That was the talk back in 2009.  

&gt;a president with numerous rape accusations is the second coming of Christ.

ACCUSATIONS... ACCUSATIONS... Why do you not understand what the word means?  Here's a fun fact, BIDEN has rape allegations against him but you don't talk about that.

Let's make a point and see if you get it.  I am accusing you of rape.  You now have rape accusations against you.  You are now just as bad as Trump because you have rape accusations against you.

Now, I'm hoping that you are smart enough to realize the point I'm getting at so that you will stop with the fucking stupid narrative where you try to use accusations as an argument.  

&gt;Which is why all the republicans politicians fell in line under Trump even after ridiculing, dismissing, and calling him out during the elections.

Kamala Harris literally called Biden a racist in the primaries and she's now his VP.  Do you just not care about being a hypocrite with your comments or are you just being willfully ignorant?

&gt;It‚Äôs about lack of critical thought for their viewership, there is only one way to view this and it‚Äôs always dire and can somehow be fixed with more taxes and costs for the middle class and less taxes and accountability for the wealthy.

Given what you've said so far, I don't think you are in a position to talk about critical thought.  It's especially more telling when you talk about more taxes for the middle class considering that Trump cut taxes for the middle class but you probably didn't notice that because you were too busy being told to get upset about the tax changes for the rich.  

Further to that, it's also completely hypocritical as Biden and democrats prepare trillions of dollars for an infrastructure plan that was take the already devastating inflation numbers and shoot them even higher.  You'll make $15 and hour but due to inflation, you'll still have the same amount of buying power.

&gt;The whole point of this post was that they wouldn‚Äôt air a commercial with footage of people storming the capital or info about the damage and injuries, because it goes against their big lie.

Or because they would be pushing someone else's big lie.  

&gt;I‚Äôm sure this is a waste of time anyway, but I just think people should vote for their interests, and that a lot of lower income republicans are being gaslit into supporting policy that doesn‚Äôt aid them.

You say that and then you vote democrat.  You say that and then you vote for the guy shutting down pipelines and making the US energy dependent again.  You say that and then you vote for the guy causing mass inflation.  I hope you realize exactly the hypocrisy that I see in your comments.

&gt;You say critical race theory is being framed as some sort of insane revolution to learning when really it‚Äôs just about recognizing the racist things that allowed us to be where we are today. 

Try actually learning about what is being taught before you open your mouth.  You are confusing the 1619 project with critical race theory.  The 1619 project talked about the formation of the US being in 1619 on a foundation of slavery.  Critical race theory is about defining people now based on their race and identity.  

&gt;America wants to have this rebel hero complex with our wealth built on slavery and genocide. 

This has been debunked so many times that it's not even funny.  Slavery and genocide are in the history of the US but it's a complete lie to say that America was only successful because of it is so blatantly wrong that it's racist to actually think that way.  

&gt; It‚Äôs not insane to just learn about the slavery and genocide in history, because it‚Äôs directly responsible for many things and that‚Äôs the point of history?

Critical race theory is not just learning about slavery and genocide.  But that's skipping past the part where someone out there believes that people aren't taught about slavery and genocide when it comes to american history.  This is ignorant.  It's false.  We've been taught about slavery.  We've been taught about the native americans.  We've been taught about all of these things and if you weren't taught these things, you are either lying or you weren't paying attention.

&gt;I don‚Äôt think we do ourselves a service by teaching kid a Christopher Columbus was a nice explorer who had polite negotiations with the Native Americans

Then you think we should lie to the kids?  I mean, that's what you are saying here.  You want to present a story to the kids about Columbus but at the same time, not actually be truthful about it.  The reality is a lot more complex than just saying Columbus bad.

&gt; that slaves didn‚Äôt have it so bad because some of them had shelter.

I don't know who actually believes slavery ""wasn't so bad"".  I think some slaves had it better than other slaves, but that doesn't exactly mean much.

"h0xrnlm","But your arguement leading up to this has been that it doesn't happen to white people at all. I hope you can understand why I was so strongly in disagreement with that.

CRT does tell you to do and view things a certain way, not just read it. For example Coca Colas diversity training thats based off CRT, that expressly stated ""be less white"", to me that says to do and view something in a specific way, wouldn't you agree?  My problem with CRT is that its an example of covert racism as defined by CRT itself. CRT posits that a white person in a white majority country that's had other ethnicities disenfranchised is inherently racist because they're born into a system that benefits them even if as with my moms case it's not the truth. So according to CRT my mom is a racist, and she just doesn't know it. Even though she harbors no ill will, resentment and prejudice for anyone. When we fled Bosnia she was almost caught and raped, I would've been murdered on the spot. Yet my mom and my dad have made friends with people who were literally fighting on the side trying to ethnically cleanse us, most of them had no choice they would be shot as deserters.

I had somebody argue with me before that CRT asserts that being ""colourblind"" aka not judging people on their skin colour is a form of white supremacy because there's no way a white person can't judge others on anything other than their skin colour. I explained to another person how my parents raised me to judge people on character and actions, not their paint job(my dad's words) and they told me I was lying to myself and sheltering myself in a perfect bubble. It's just mind boggling that in an attempt to eradicate racism, we need to label people of a certain race as inherently racist even if they themselves don't do anything racist, or think they're a racist like myself. 

I've considered the history of black people and have had enlightening conversations about whats been done to them in North America specifically with black people, white people especially ones in first world country's can't understand that shit because for the most part they've been sheltered all their lives. If it's one thing I can relate to people with its struggle, oppression, ethnic cleansing because my peoples history is littered littered that shit. This new age CRT bullshit I just can't get behind, I can't agree with people who will tell me the problem is that I'm born white.

When i first came here and heard talking points like""well they need to just work harder, pull themselves up by their boot straps, they must not be working hard enough, they're probably addicts or criminals"" I just took it at face value, I was young and ignorant of all the history and current social dynamics. Redlining, redistricting, black Wallstreet, 2 acres and a mule, drug laws that punished poor and minorities for crack while cocaine laws were lax, the fact that the government itself brought crack and coke into the inner cities and minority neighborhoods, the black panthers and how they were infiltrated and destroyed when their sole reason for existing was protecting and uplifting black people lynchings and poverty, the bombings in Philadelphia etc I'm 100% against that and believe it's fucking evil. 

Yet even though I oppose all that, I still have to hear dumbasses tell me I'm the problem because I was born white, or because I literally follow the words of MLK when it comes to race and I'm sheltered in a perfect bubble for not being a racist because according to them that's supposed to be my default setting. Or if I mention I can't support BLM the organization because you constantly see BLM organizers being outed as racists, like the one in Toronto who refered to white people as subhuman. I hear that crap from white and black people, but more so white people who seem to wanna play the savior.

Sorry for the long shpiel, I just couldn't fit all my thoughts on this into a shorter reply. If I come off as combative don't take it personally, that's actually my default setting.

"h0wo3ya","I can understand her struggle completely. It's not just that but there are so many things that comes after abuse that like you said if you haven't experienced it then you don't understand it. And i completely understand why there is only an exclusive amount of people who knows down the the most intimate details. Even my bf doesn't know all the things that happened to me because i'm not sure what he would think of me. I've even told my bf to only share general information to get advice and not go into details if he feels the need to seek advice from his family to help me. And like you said it's her story to tell and i can understand why it makes it harder for you to process the information because you didn't experienced it yourself. Secondhand trauma is a thing and if i were you i would definitely see if you can come to therapy with her if she is okay with it to talk to her therapist and see if they can recommend anything you can do to help her as well as yourself. Because believe it or not if you let your secondhand trauma sits it'll start having effect on you as a person. Gosh i can tell you so many times the people in my life responded in such a way that it makes me mad that they sounded so selfish and ignorant of my trauma but then i had to remind myself that most people have never been in this kind of situation before and so they don't understand and their brain kinda malfunctions a bit. And it's hard as a survivor to be able to open up to have a normal conversation with other people because that's not what our normal looks like. Our normal is a series of explosive events with shift blames and violence and it can turns nuclear in a matter of seconds. So i can definitely understand that. It's taken so much time and effort for me to not go into a panic attack if my bf doesn't respond to a text within a matter of minutes because my brain goes oh no what did i do wrong and how should i anticipate this. Even with a sympathetic parent or friends or whatever because i've got a lot of those on my end, it doesn't feel the same as with those we are completely comfortable around because we don't know how people would think of us if they knew the truth. Like for instance take me. I'm super hyper and positive at work and i'm always working my butt off but behind closed doors i'm a world of abused and trauma since i was a kid. A first glace you would think i've had it easy but not until you get to know me that you would be scare to even touch me because i could break at any second. That kind of thing. If i were you i'd be there for her when she needs you. I would even recommend going with her to therapy if she is okay with you tagging along because that might help you as well to see things through her point of view and to be able to resort things through as a supporter. I'm not sure how that would work because therapy never really worked for me and i've resorted to writing and drawing other things that helped me cope. But definitely see if that is an option. 

As far as rambling goes these things never cease to become rambles. The more you seek advice for the more you'll be able to help and understand. It's one of those things that people never really pays attention to and rarely talked about because domestic abuse starts out sooo subtle that when it's a problem you find it hard to get out. 

I'm glad that your relationship with your gf is going great! Im hoping for better thing to comes for both of you. I know you'll take good care of her because here you are asking for advice on how to support her.

"h0ufgsd","No. Just no.

Firstly, comparing which state killed more people is useless for an ideological comparison, since states aren't completely 100% doing exactly as the ideology would theoretically command always. Especially since ideologies are very vague on many many details. Furthermore, comparing the amounts of murders ignores the quality of everybody else's life. I would for example argue - and this is an exaggeration to make a point - having 1 million people living in the worst possible conditions is not necessarily better or even directly comparable to 50 people being killed and the rest of people having an amazing quality of life. I hope this makes the problem of just looking at numbers of deaths useless.

Furthermore, states don't exist in a vacuum. Most socialist nations were less developed than the capitalist states. If we include all the death and suffering that existed during capitalist industrialization, the numbers would look very different already. Also, many states had a history of being colonized and exploited, which has many long term consequences, especially when reparations are lacking. Eastern Europe, also for example, was far harder hit by the Nazi war machine, which waged an extermination war in the east specifically, causing much suffering even after having surrendered. Thus, not every famine, for example, can just be blamed on the state it occurred under.

Also, when do you cause a death, especially as a state. Sure, executions kill people. But most deaths aren't executions. You could for example argue that states with free, public health care have generally far less health issues than states with a privatized, profit-oriented health sector. Not receiving medicine or treatment kills people all the time, oftentimes not even directly. Now, how would we count deaths like that. Maybe we should look at the average age of death, but then states with legalized euthanasia would probably look much worse.

"h0ladbk","Your demon function is the one that contradicts your hero function in every way imaginable.

Your dominant (1st) function will have some overlap with both your 4th &amp; 5th functions, but almost zero overlap with your 8th (demon) function other than some rare coincidental results of using each.

The most important thing to understand that two functions on the same axis can not exist without each other and they are just extroverted 

Let's take me as an example. When I was less mature and didn't know about MBTI, I naturally hated when people overused my 5th, but I hated it even more when people based their decision on using what I now know is my demon function.

As a demonic function, it seems like using it would be the most backwards way you could imagine yourself doing things, you'd have to go against the very essence of yourself (hero, 1st function) to adhere to it.

As a specific example, me as an ISTP, when I was younger, immature and ignorant of MBTI and cognitive functions would see Fi Dom's as super judgemental, unable to give chances to people, and very stringent in how they see themselves and how they see others. It seemed a bit obnoxious to me, and I'm sure the immature IxFPs would have said the same of me.

But now, learning about MBTI, I respect that some people focus on Fi and there are actually some benefits to it. Still, if I tried to rule my own life via Fi, it would be destructive.

It's prejudiced and cruel, but it isn't the experience of being turned down for a job because your employer thinks your body will scare customers away, or not being believed when you say you've been assaulted because it's assumed no one would ""want you,"" or to have your entire career as an activist/artist rejected by society because of your body. It's not just bullying. There doesn't need to be a ""no fat people allowed"" sign for fat people to be excluded. There doesn't need to be a ""no black people allowed"" sign for black people to be oppressed. Both of those things are literally illegal in the US. If they weren't, I guarantee you some stores would totally have them. (Again, it isn't appropriate to equate fatphobia with racism, but bigotry is bigotry no matter who it's targeting.) It's worth mentioning that poor people, particularly poor people of color, statistically experience higher rates of obesity than wealthy white people. It throws another form of discrimination at already oppressed individuals. Obesity is in many cases not the result of laziness or gluttony, but instead of the intentional restrictions placed on your community such as food deserts. I've actually taken the time to read about this and listen to those who have. At first I felt the same as you. I thought fatphobia was some bullshit excuse invented by fat people so they could participate in the dreaded Oppression Olympics. But then I slowed down. I took the time to listen, to look into the issue myself, and to come to a conclusion not based in bigotry but instead in fact. 

Obesity causes health problems, but that doesn't mean the obese should be treated cruelly. Fat-shaming doesn't work. 

The ""there are bigger problems"" argument is the worst argument I've ever heard. Should the issue of racist depictions in the media be ignored because of the racism that operates at a systemic level? Should the issue of sexual harassment be ignored because sexual assault happens? Should the trauma some experience from bullying be ignored because others have trauma from more extreme events? Of course not. It's not one or the other. My focus extends beyond just plastic mannequins in stores, but you assume it doesn't because of some strawman of me you've obviously created. Representation, even something as seemingly insignificant as mannequins, is part of a larger structure attempting to redefine beauty standards, not just to benefit overweight women, but to benefit anyone with what some call marginalized bodies.

But you're not going to believe me no matter what I say. You don't want me to be right. Honestly, neither do I. I wish things were better than I'm telling you they are. So I must be delusional and ignorant of the ""definition of words.""

Anyway, I'm done with this. Spend more time thinking about it before you dismiss the opinions of those who actually have.

This is basically the argument your are falling victim for when comparing processors made for 2 entirely different use cases, hardware, and operating systems. 

Where benchmarks really shine are when you use them to compare improvements in generational changes between the same processor across different years. Say like Apples A11 vs A12 ""Bionic"". The reason this works is because the only variable that changes are the improvements in the chip. The OS, software, and hardware surrounding the chip are virtually identical otherwise.

Ask any respectible scientist, when doing a study you use the scientific method. In this method you change 1 variable in the test subject(s) and have 1 subject as a constant (nothing changed).

Cannibalism is taboo in nearly every culture to deny that is extremely misleading and ignorant of yourself.

And when I say we have evolved to not eat humans it's not from a context of that we gained an evolutionary advantage from not eating humans, but that the ones that did suffered and so humans today dont eat other. Being killed off by parasites and not being able to reproduce allowing other humans who dont part take in that activity to reproduce and pass down the characteristic and behaviour of not eating humans is still a form of evolution.

"gzl27d3","&gt;Seems to me like you're saying it's not okay

I'm saying that doesn't in and of itself justify it, yeah. People buying something doesn't mean that something is good. That's inherently circular logic. 50 Shades of Grey made millions of dollars - its depiction of a kinky BDSM relationship is still bad and ignorant of that lifestyle. How much it sold doesn't change that. 

&gt;I was going to list some anime that doesn't sexualize their females but it would be such a long list

But percentage wise, how much would it actually be? Like, there could be 10,000 items on that list. If that's out of 1,000,000 individual works - then that's still pathetically small and shows of a serious representation issue. Anime has a problem with representing women, and this is just another part of that problem. 

&gt;Lastly, whether the creators ""vision"" is flawed or not doesn't matter because its the creators work.

&gt;If you don't like it leave and make you're own that has all of your own preferences.

If that's the level of engagement you want, then exercise it.

You're just trying to dismiss with quibbling. I don't care how smart the creator is - this still looks bad. Grow up - the world doesn't bow to you, and neither do I. If you don't like my words, leave, and drop this childish act. 

You and I both know this line of argument is pure BS on your part and nothing more than deflecting because you don't have much of a point otherwise. Call it a criticism instead of a critique.

"gzi4vvk","Well, I would say you should aim for the cerebral combat of a high tension spy movie or political movie.


For reference, let‚Äôs examine True Lies, because I just love that movie.

What makes a situation high tension?

1.  High stakes.

This could be personal (my wife will divorce me!) or political (my country will suffer massive embarrassment).  For true lies, there is the threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists, mixed with the personal and professional challenges of keeping your loved ones safe and ignorant of the mess of the world.

2. No easy solution 

If combat could solve every problem, there would be no politicians, only generals.  Consider Clausewitz, ‚ÄúWar is an extension of politics by other means‚Äù.

In other words, combat is the fall back option, not the first solution.  If the negotiator can convince a kidnapper to give up the hostages, why send in the SWAT team?

If Arnold can convince the terrorist arms broker to give up her sources and the terrorists, they wouldn‚Äôt have had to call in the military to blow up several buildings and a bridge.

3.  The antagonists are not necessarily bad or evil.  This adds complexity and a necessary shade of grey for that World of Darkness feel.

True Lies doesn‚Äôt do a good job of that, but in the context of the movie, Arnold becomes an antagonist to his wife for a portion of the movie.  From his point of view, he is trying to save their marriage.  From her point of view, she has been kidnapped and coerced into a shadowy organization making her degrade herself for safety.  So if you can take that relationship dynamic and apply it to your game, you are doing great.

I think the movie Bullitt does a much better job of this.  It is full of unlikeable but not evil characters, some doing what they think is right, some just acting in self interest, and some that are just bad people.

4.  There is a time limit.

The bomb goes off in 20 minutes.  I have 2 hours before my speech.  In 1 week the election hits and I have to figure out how to stuff the ballot box.


So with those 4 points, let‚Äôs take this scenario.  You have a rich benefactor, a bodyguard, and a scholar (your players) going to a party at an elegant home.  The home is owned by a collector of occult items.  The benefactor has lost out on several high visibility auctions to him, and the scholar wants to prove that the owner is passing off frauds as original pieces.

Now this could be a heist scene, or a shootout, but what about this:

The benefactor must distract the hosts with witty conversations, draw attention with speeches, and swallow his pride to praise the host.

The bodyguard must dance with the ladies (or men, whatever), inciting a bit of jealousy and drawing attention as well.

Meanwhile the scholar is on a time limit to get access to the artifacts/paintings/etc.

Did they have to bribe some people?  What research was done on security?  Is there actual mystic protections he must defeat?

So you can have high stakes with no combat, a social antagonist, and a time limit.",1622030140,"for true lies, there is the threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists, mixed with the personal and professional challenges of keeping your loved ones safe and ignorant of the mess of the world.","safe and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"safe and ignorant","safe",NA,NA,0

"gzh6dip","That's the best you can do? 

You have no middle ground between ""everything is equally valid"" and ""oh noes! An evil gatekeeper!""

You base the validity of Magick on belief, but you are ignorant of the arbiter of magick that already exists: Result. Success and failure.

""Child magick is literally just magick done by children. Its wishes. Its silly and playful and to them it's real.""

That right there sums up what's wrong with your definition, and understanding of magick. You entirely disregard the place of objective reality, only placing value on subjective reality. It's all about belief and make believe. 

And you don't define things well either. Everything you described child magick as can be and is done by all stages of human development. Likewise, a child could in theory practice most other forms of magick. Nothing about that is inherently childish. 

You also erroneously think gatekeeping is evil. It is not; it serves an important set of functions. It can be done badly or harmful, but it's also very beneficial done right. 

For example- would you want to have someone who's never been to medical school, and has never passed the licensing exam do surgery on you? I'll wager you would be very opposed to it. Because surgery is dangerous and needs to be done right. 

Anything that has power is dangerous. 

Medical licensing is -ABSOLUTELY- gatekeeping, and thank Gods for it. By this gatekeeping they make sure everyone who practices medicine has a baseline of competence and skill. This makes it so anyone can go to a doctor and have reasonably consistently good results. 

The only way you can say what you have is if you don't regard magick as dangerous- and you can only think that way if you don't think magick is powerful. 

That's why you don't care about objective reality or results, just belief. 

This is all just a game to you. It isn't real. It has no more significance than the play of children. 

And that's fine, you do you boo.

But you have no business giving advice on magick to anyone- any more than someone who's never been to medical school has writing prescriptions.

You neither respect or understand the -power- of magick. 

And as such, you neither respect or understand magick at all. 

The only way you could not understand the power of magick is if you've never actually had or wielded it... or at least not enough to respect it. 

And that's why this definition of magick you have is harmful. 

It is born of people who are weak and ignorant of magick. Naturally, and inevitably it breeds the same in those who embrace it. It puts people at risk because they are told anything is equally fine. It makes people cast magick in ways that harms them and others.

You are free to think and act as you please, but if you call yourself a witch, or regard yourself as a practitioner and maintain this mentality you really aren't one.

And you shouldn't be giving advice to people, especially people who are in trouble.

You think you are empowering people, but you are only weakening them. You think you are enlightening them, but you only weaken them.

Well I was referring to the fact that Estonian has no gendered pronouns (*tema/ta*), just like Finnish (*h√§n*).

&gt;For me it is clear that our world seems to think we are racially divided, although there‚Äôs no biological/rational basis for racism.

Okay, but how do you get from this to accepting different standards of rules based on races? I don't see how this could lead to anything good. 

Firstly, it forces one to pick a racial identity and this, in turn, puts pressure to start making rules about what defines someone's race (can't have those of A pretend they're part of B, right). This alone sounds really creepy to me. 

But secondly, it also forces an additional layer of identity politics which takes the focus away from all other problems. We've all seen how stupid it can already become without race, like in Balkans, people who speak the same Serbo-Croatian language and have similar culture can hate each other so much because of religious identity. Why would anybody want to do that again, but based on skin tone?

The world is not perfect, of course. There's more racism than we would like to see. But this ""white people can't decide what is offensive to black people"" is *not* the solution. Because then, can white people decide what is offensive to them and therefore, which black people can't use? And from here, we usually enter the woke-logic where there is actually no logic at all.

It is simply important to note that our european cultures are predominantly not black and brown, and therefore we are not some ‚Äúneutral party‚Äù to the global discourse on racism, irregardless of our subjective (non-)colonial histories.

‚ÄúColour blindness‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take us very far in understanding the contemporary european/finnish/estonian/russian ethnic tensions. For me it is clear that our world seems to *think* we are racially divided, although there‚Äôs no biological/rational basis for racism. That for me is enough reason to consider our ‚Äúglobal culture‚Äù as racist, or at least racially divisive. Just look at the current world, and tell me if it is a ‚Äúrace neutral‚Äù one in your opinion. 

I am simply trying to state the obvious from what I see in my homeland; I have not studied the racial discourses in the US, for example (any more than the next person).",1621770326,"once again, i am almost completely oblivious and ignorant of the estonian language and its specific nuances.","oblivious and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"completely oblivious and ignorant","oblivious",NA,"completely",0

"gz3y4bb","You are shaving your head even though you aren't bald because you don't like having hair, then go on to say ""just be who your body wants you to be"". Pretty sure your body doesn't want you bald, eh?

More seriously, just because your ""body wants something"", doesn't mean your brain is agreeing with it. Your advice is akin to saying ""just be happy"" to someone suffering from depression.

Everytime someone balding who isn't instantly shaving their hair is posted on Reddit, we have comment like yours everywhere, I'm starting to believe we have a lot of balding dudes pushing a message on this website.

Body image issues are extremely complicated, if it was that easy we would know. And contrarily to what this *wonderful* place tends to say, it's not just societal pressure, social media and people wanting to look good for the approval of others, it very often is about self-worth and self-esteem.  
And sometimes, more than you'd think, the solution is to fix what's bothering you, with hair pieces, implants, surgery, medication...etc 

Why wouldn't you if it's possible? Living life miserably to make a point is not an achievement, and making people feel bad for going this way is simply terrible for their mental health.  
We have solutions, using them is not a shame. 

That's before we even get into serious issues like body dysmorphia who is absolutely terrible and can damage, both psychologically and physically, even people who are conventionally very attractive.

And finally, we have gender dysphoria who is in a league of its own I'd say. Don't say to a transgender person that they should just ""be who their body wants them to be"", it would be very offensive and ignorant of the struggle they are going through. 

This is backed up by the fact that in many countries, like France (mine), cosmetic surgery can be entirely covered financially speaking if they are deemed to be psychologically damaging to you.  
That's the case for everything related to my gender dysphoria, and I have a friend who had terrible psychological issues with her small breasts and had the opportunity to get surgery entirely covered.  

You might think those are very different than balding issues, and yes they are more complex issues, but the point is that whenever someones feels bad about their body in any way, we have armchair experts either going ""just go to therapy"" or ""just accept who you are"", when the best solutions in these situations are very often the simplest : change what's bothering you.

This is a long comment, but this is subject I take at heart and it pains me to see this backward mentality everywhere on Reddit, as if any procedure or method to make your body looks more like you want it too was ridiculous.",1621727630,"don't say to a transgender person that they should just ""be who their body wants them to be"", it would be very offensive and ignorant of the struggle they are going through.","offensive and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"very offensive and ignorant","offensive",NA,"very",0

Rape is unwanted sex. sex without permision from both parties involved. 
Rape is not always violent, it is when sex is forced upon someone else with utter disregard for what they want.

In fact even if he did say yes it would be classified as sexual coercion which is rape. It happens when someone is pressured or threatened into saying yes to sex.

Do you recall how church leadership positions are appointed?

"gyllwgo","Are you claiming that pre British rule of Palestine there was some interfaith/ethnic utopia that existed?
 
While the the Jewish experience in Muslim lands from the medieval to early modern period was more often than not less oppressive and more prosperous than in western Christian lands, they were still considered dhimmis, second class citizens and subordinate to Muslims. Jews still suffered persecutions and pogroms under Muslim rule, even if it was not as bad as the persecution Jews experienced under Western/Christian rule, that doesn't mean it should be forgotten about. Nor should the fact that some Jews were able to gain more wealth and power under Muslim rule be twisted into some false notion that the Jew and Muslim lived in harmony until the Bonger nation ""attacked""

Both the Zionist movement and the Arab nationalism that rises in response to it begin long before Britain gains control of Palestine, beginning during the Ottoman period. Increasing amounts Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine during the 19th century radically changed Arab opinion on Jews for the worse as they now believed that the creation of a Jewish state was the goal. Fast forward a bit to 1908 and you get the Young Turk Revolution which causes nationalist sentiment to grow rapidly amongst Arabs in Palestine and most importantly states explicitly that Zionism a threat to Arabs in Palestine.

This trend I've seen lately of just hand waving away any nuance and complexity to an issue that exists in a former colonial territory and just saying ""Britain bad"" is getting pretty tired and worn out.

I'd say it's due to it not being at a great point it's somewhere between government and free market but doesn't have either benefits. 

&gt;I don't personally need expensive healthcare at present, so why should I pay for other people?

Because you live in a society and that mindset would basically lead to the worst outcome for everyone because most of the time people don't need healthcare. So if everyone just doesn't pay it becomes incredibly expensive to the few people who currently need it and no one has that kind of reserve.
It's like saying ""i don't currently drive on a highway so hy should i pay so that other people can drive on it?""

Sure maybe privatised healthcare could lead to great benefit through competition but each competitor would still have to cut as many costs as possible meaning trying to not pay when they should and not seek certain investments.

"gy230v7","&gt; Yes, it would. It's called spoils of war.

Literally illegal for about 70 years. It was UN Charter rather than the Geneva conventions, which is what I mistakenly attributed it to, but the point stands.

&gt;In this context, I have to. Wars aren't fought by tiny groups of independent citizens who could never afford more than one tank, if that. Furthermore, not only are all countries not democratic or a republic, all of their citizens are represented by governments. (Otherwise they would revolt)

That is an unbelievably naive view of the world, and of the Middle East in particular. You cannot reasonably demand that people rise up against their governments when the result would be staring down the barrel of a tank. Many people are just trying to live their lives, and the actions of their government can often seem far removed from their day to day. This is especially true for Middle Eastern nations because their borders are largely artificial, imposed by departing colonial governments. Government is often dominated by a subset of the population, generally either an ethic or religious majority or a minority empowered by access to wealth or power.

&gt;That's just how it works, I didn't make the rules and neither does treaties or agreements. (Otherwise there wouldn't be war in the first place)

We literally do make the rules, bud. Yes, we would have to mount a counteroffensive if our enemy refused to obey the principles that we believe should apply to war. *But in this situation, it is our ally that is failing to abide by the principles of war that we have laid down.*

‚ÄúThe History of Heart of the Jedi and How it Didn't Get Published

By Kenneth C. Flint

In 1991, I was making my living as an author. I was writing two books a year for Spectra, the sci-fi-fantasy imprint of Bantam Doubleday Dell. I‚Äôd had twelve books published, with a seven book backlist and a million books in print. I had just signed a new two book contract with Spectra, with titles to be decided later. Then I got an exciting word from my editor.

Because of the success of a hardcover Star Wars trilogy by Timothy Zahn, Lucasfilm had asked Spectra to publish an additional series of paperbacks. Spectra had searched through its stable for suitable authors, sending copies of our works to Lucasfilm for selection. My books were Celtic-based sword-and sorcery, but my Sidhe series books were a fantasy/sci-fi combination, and a review of Riders of the Sidhe said it ‚Äúhas enough derring-do for at least one Lucas film.

Apparently George Lucas thought so too, because I was told he had personally selected me to do a Star Wars book. Even better, I would be writing Book One of the proposed series, taking place immediately after the second Death Star is destroyed [Note: This would have been followed by Margaret Weiss‚Äô Legacy of Doom, with both books to be preceded by Jim Baikie‚ÄôsExiles of the Force four-part comic-book mini-series from Dark Horse Comics. Weiss later stated that she'd had a disagreement with Lucasfilm, and Baikie‚Äôs series was cancelled ‚ÄìEd.] Being a crazy big Star Wars fan (I saw the first movie seven times in the theater and drank my coffee from a Star Wars mug), you can imagine how thrilled I was.

I was given pretty much free rein on developing my plot, other than that it should take place immediately after the second Death Star is destroyed. I up front figured it would be most logical to deal with a defeated but not destroyed Empire, its military desperately trying to regroup and retaliate against the Alliance, while other elements sought to make peace. Along with this was my assumption that I had to deal with what Luke Skywalker had become, and where he was going as a Jedi.

I spent the first months developing an outline and submitted it to my editor. I want to make the point, here, that I never, throughout all this, communicated directly with the Lucasfilm people or knew who they were. I worked for Spectra, and everything came through my editor. But I was told, and very honored to hear, that George Lucas himself had approved my plot, with one specific alteration‚ÄîI had shown Sand People without their masks, and he said that that must never happen.

I spent most of the next year writing that book, putting my own books aside. My primary sources were the movies themselves, which I watched over-and-over (often in slo-mo), and a Star Wars Sourcebook for game players from West End Games that Lucasfilm supplied. By the end of 1992 I had a draft ready. I sent it in and waited‚Ä¶ and waited. When I inquired as to how it was going, my editor said that the process of the Star Wars project according to one source) that her book would be placed in Position One. This apparently accounted for the ‚Äúdelays‚Äù that I had been told about, while she wrote her own book to slip into my slot while I sat idle and ignorant of what was happening for months. I have made a point of not knowing who this other author is, and I have never been able to bring myself to read her book, or any other of the subsequent series, saddened that this so violated my love of everything Star Wars.

Did I confront Lucasfilm and try to fight this situation? Nope. I didn‚Äôt know who to contact or how, remember. I worked for Spectra. I had no resources of my own, I was pitifully na√Øve, and I felt pretty much powerless by that point.

Oh, they graciously let me keep the ten thousand dollar advance. And they threw me a bone letting me still do two Star Wars short stories (for Tales from Jabba‚Äôs Palace and Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina), but I was done otherwise. None of my own books came out as the debacle went on (I would normally have published four new ones) I went back to teaching as an English department adjunct for the University of Nebraska at Omaha (my alma mater) and got the book written. I then discovered that, nowadays, an author of fiction can‚Äôt even submit a book to a publisher without going through an agent.

I searched for an agent for a couple of years, but found no one. It seems that unless they are sure they can sell a specific book of yours, they won‚Äôt handle you. I guess that seems fair. And I had been out of the business (by my own choice) a long time.

But then I got a new chance. An online publisher agreed to put out all my old novels as e-books. He also published my new book, now called Ironclad.

I‚Äôve written other things too, since then. My family does living history at the reconstructed 1820‚Äôs frontier outpost called Fort Atkinson (near Omaha). I started a series of historical novels based at the place, and got a history book of the fort published through Arcadia.

So my old fans can still find my books through Amazon. But, man, I‚Äôd love to get Ironclad put out as a physical, ‚Äúand I still have ideas for other fantasy, sci-fi, and horror plots, plus the twenty or so other Celtic/Irish books I‚Äôd still like to write. I think I‚Äôve got at least a few viable years of authorship in me. (So, if anybody knows of somebody who‚Äôd like to represent me, I am ready to start writing two books a year again.) Otherwise, I am quite content teaching some writing classes and being the school time daycare for my two grandsons, age 3 years and 6 months. ‚Äú",1620713220,"this apparently accounted for the ‚Äúdelays‚Äù that i had been told about, while she wrote her own book to slip into my slot while i sat idle and ignorant of what was happening for months.","idle and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"idle and ignorant","idle",NA,NA,0

"gxjbp34","I don't find that to be the case in my experience. Both in my personal life and professionally, feminism is the norm, more so now than ever. 

When I studied women's history in the 90s it was still more hived off, and during my master's degree I worked with old school, Ivy League historians who thought women's history was a fad and a phase, but that's not the case now of any historian I've met, including male ones. 

I was at a presentation yesterday where the leadership of my org, male and female, spoke very openly and earnestly about the problems of racism, white supremacy, and toxic masculinity without hesitation or self-consciousness. The prime minister of my country is a feminist and says so. It's pretty normal to be a feminist where I am.

I haven't met anyone who doesn't identify as a feminist in real life in ages (even before the pandemic), and if someone in my orbit expressed disagreement with the basic arguments of feminism (that women are equal human beings and must be seen that way), they would certainly lose a lot of friends, respect, and opportunities, at a minimum. Anti-feminism is considered hateful and ignorant.

Of course, there's plenty of debate among feminists about all manner of things, so we don't agree on everything. But we agree that women are as fully human as men, and that longstanding sexist, white supremacist values have misshapen our thinking and our society for a very long time. That much is pretty obvious, and accepting it isn't a very big ask.

There's still plenty of work to do. In 1989 when a man walked into l'√âcole Polytechnique, separated the women from the men, and shot the women for daring to study engineering at a school that rejected him, the men in media rejected the idea that it was an misogynist act, a hate crime against women. When Alex Minassian drove a van into a crowd because women wouldn't sleep with him in 2018, it was labeled misogynist terrorism. I'd say that's a step forward in the general acceptance of feminism rather than a step back.

In my professional experience, as a vet tech of 9 years, I have not yet had a cat have their anxiety get worse on fluoxetine, nor have I had it in dogs, either.

Your suggestions of 'giving kitty more cuddles' is honestly ridiculous and has no basis in the understanding of feline behaviour or veterinary medicine.

NAH.

I think pretty much every parent in America has a whole new appreciation for our kids' teachers after the last year. Like, seriously, I don't care what they pay you - it's not enough. I'm sure pandemic teaching has been harder than we can imagine. That being said, as the parent of an elementary age kid...

I can only speak for parents like myself that actually GAF, but let me be frank. If you think that 20 minute zoom lesson you prepared was sufficient for the average kid to grasp what you're trying to teach, you're out of your mind. I have spent the last year googling math concepts every. single. day. in an attempt to help my kid stay afloat. And it's not that I can't do math, it's that the bizarre world of common core is totally foreign to just, you know, DOING THE MATH.  My days have been an endless, revolving door of, ""MOM! Can you explain blah blah blah again, please?"" ""MOM! Teacher says I need to record this thing in costume, can you help me put one together?"" ""MOM! I can't get on to teams. Help me!"" ""MOM! What's a blah blah blah again?"" ""MOM! It's camp week and I have these 15 craft projects I'm supposed to do with nothing more than YouTube to guide me. Can you help me?"" ""MOM! I don't understand this and teacher isn't answering my email, what do I do?"" ""MOM! I don't understand these directions!"" And don't forget, keeping our kids focused on your lessons while their classmates are waving their cat/dog/hamster/new toy around, planning their play dates, siblings are popping on and off screen, other kids are playing in the street while my kid is forced to actually be in class and pay attention, etc.

So yeah, please don't discount just how much teaching (involved) parents have actually been doing. Every question some kid would normally come up to your desk and ask has been answered by their parent for the last 15 months. And we don't have your education, background, resources, or years of teaching to draw upon to know what the heck we're doing. Every question you can answer offhand because you just know, we have to research, and we STILL might not find the right answer. 

At minimum, during this pandemic, we've been team-teaching, you and I. I respect how ridiculously hard you've been working to keep kids from falling behind, but please don't dismiss how damn hard I've been working, too. Especially considering this is your full time job that you were trained to do. I was not trained to do this. On top of that, I also have a job of my own, that ISN'T this, that I have to do at the same time.

I sure as hell don't call myself a teacher, and it's ridiculous of your friend to expect acknowledgement during teacher appreciation week.

I don't think I have to read the other comments to know that they have already pointed out that not understanding the distinction between MD and PhD makes them seem incredibly ignorant. This is the kind if behavior I would expect from a family of uneducated rednecks, not medical doctors. Did they not also all attend undergraduate university taught by esteemed PhDs? It's incredibly telling about their character if they would go through 4 years of being taught by PhDs and still consider themselves above them. All of society agrees that it is appropriate to call someone with a PhD doctor. Personally I value a PhD (especially in humanities) a lot more than an MD. An MD qualifies you to do a job, albeit a high-paying job, but that's it. Being a PhD means that you have written a dissertation that advances your field at least somewhat and that you are on the forefront of human knowledge in that particular area. It's incredibly valuable to grapple with humanities questions. 

And this is my own personal opinion as a humble philosophy BA - I think it brings you to a higher caliber of living. It's one thing to wake up every day and do a job until you die (which is ultimately what most doctors' jobs boil down to), it's another to fill your days with virtuous rational activity of the soul (Aristotle's words not mine) and tackle life's biggest questions. Most philosophies would put a life in the humanities as a life better spent than one doing the mundane work of fixing people's bodies.

"gx0hecd"," My intention is not to defend the ""K"" word or even take advantage of it but how it was used and at the same time to explain its origins and its relationship with those who both ustilise it in the past and the present

 The word ""Kaling"" is an old name for an ancient indian kingdom; ""Kalinga"", now known as the province or state of Odisha. One must first understand the relationship between Indian social, political and economical relationship with that of South East Asia or in our case; ""Alam Melayu"" or the ""Malay World"". The Malay world which consists of Brunei, Malaysia, the entirety of Indonesia and the Philipines were exposed to Indian culture. As can be seen in Indonesia where the great temples or Chandis of Perambanan, a Hindu temple, and Borobodur, a Buddhist temple. In addition to this would be the Mahabharata and Ramayana, two indian epics that are present within South East Asian culture which was slightly altered according to those who adopted it. Furthermore would be the Garuda and if I rember correctly was the Bird of Vishnu or Indra that fought against the serpent Naga, this great avian can be seen on the Indonesian government‚Äôs coat of arms and the Thai Royal family's. Nonetheless, Kalinga being a Thalassocracy extended their culture or in a more general term, Indian culture, to that of South East Asia and was possibly seen as a great maritime power in the aspects of politics, society and economy to the inhabitants of the Malay World, albeit the latter arrogant and ignorant of India's large collection of different polities and nations.

 Now comes the matter of linguistics and culture, in the medieval and colonial era and how it has influenced the use of such a word in the modern era. As far as I know the word Keling has been used continuously in Hikayat Hang Tuah, the Epic of Hang Tuah. Where during the zenith of the Mallacan sultanate a trader of Indian or ""Keling"" origin came to the Sultan, it was here where the Sultan later sent a member of his family to join in hand with the ""Keling"" to become king or raja for one of the ""Keling"" states. In Hang Tuah the word ""Keling"" is reffered onto the Indian sub-continent and her people as a general term for a geographical position (""Benua Keling"") and those who inhabit that area. In the age of colonilaism, the British upon colonising India made use of the local population. Those that were arrested were later sent to British possessions in South East Asia as prisoners who were forced into labour. Indian prisoners who were shackled with metal handcuffs can be heard from afar due to their metal shackles constantly clanking with each other. This in turn gave birth to a indirect nickname called ""Kling"" or ""Kaling"" later integrated into a culture of name calling on a specific Racial-Ethnic group where the latter who do not know how to speak Malay at first was confused which in turn is interpreted to be offensive when explained by his Malay counterpart. In addition to this the word ""Kling"" might have also orginated from the braclets and jewlery used by Indian women. Of course with such common use of the word keling, overtime it has been brought into the vernacular language as a common terminology for Indians.

 Nonetheless, to put it simply, Kalinga's influence and prestige as a national entity from the other polities within the Indian Sub-continent has in turn created a general or in the vernacular language ""stereotyped"" Identity on the Malay world for which people woud call that geographical position as Kalinga due to their merits in the theatres of politics, culture and trade. Overtime with such common use of the word keling, it has been brought into the vernacular language as a common terminology for Indians.",1620213020,"nonetheless, kalinga being a thalassocracy extended their culture or in a more general term, indian culture, to that of south east asia and was possibly seen as a great maritime power in the aspects of politics, society and economy to the inhabitants of the malay world, albeit the latter arrogant and ignorant of india's large collection of different polities and nations.","arrogant and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"arrogant and ignorant","arrogant",NA,NA,0

She had a degree, but it was in education and she hadn't been in a classroom in that long and didn't have any current licenses or endorsements, so all she could have done with it was part-time subbing.

Ok so let me give you a lesson on management. A short, crash course.

When large software bugs are preventing a program from performing up to expectations, the relevant teams meet up, discuss the problems one by one and give them priorities. That doesn't mean they shut out everything else. Bug report continues and compiling these problems means new ones can pop up that supersede the ones that were initially categorized or depending on the difficulty to fix them and progress on other tasks, an specific individual or individuals are put to work on that.

In short, whatever you're trying to say, and trust me; it's really cute that you try, it's wrong and not how any serious software development team operates.

&gt;	I‚Äôd like to see your data that suggests that people using dead names is a myth. Even the paper you linked says that voter fraud happens, even though it‚Äôs not common. 

[Here‚Äôs an article on the subject.](https://ballotpedia.org/Votes_cast_in_the_names_of_deceased_people)

&gt;	And I agree with that, but as long as even one vote in the entire election is fraudulent, the process is flawed.

The problem with this idea is that it disenfranchises far more legitimate voters than it does prevent illegitimate votes.

&gt;	We need to get that number down to zero and the only way possible is if people have to prove they are who they say they are. 

We don‚Äôt really need to, our elections aren‚Äôt close enough to be concerned with that small a number, and in the rare case it can come into play, recounts handle this problem.

&gt;	I dont know what crazy world you think poor, urban, minorities live in where in 3 years they cant make their way to the dmv to get an ID, but it‚Äôs not reality. 

It‚Äôs entirely reality. You‚Äôre just making a straw man argument. Nobody said that it‚Äôs impossible. But as an anecdote, I live in Florida. 3 years ago I would not have qualified to get a driver‚Äôs license in Florida‚Äôs current requirements. 

But more importantly, the problem here isn‚Äôt impossibility, it‚Äôs about adding difficulty to cut down votes. This is a real thing backed up by real data, and ignored by you because it doesn‚Äôt conform to the opinion assigned to you.

&gt;	I challenge you to find a statistic of minority US citizens who dont have a license. 

I don‚Äôt care what you challenge me to do. I don‚Äôt do the monkey dance for dishonest fucks who can‚Äôt even acknowledge basic data, let alone admit they were wrong. But hey, here‚Äôs an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html) summarizing the difficulties as a consolation prize.

There‚Äôs no shortage of articles explaining why this is a problem and no shortage of data explaining that your concern isn‚Äôt a real problem. You simply ignore all of it because you would rather ignore the ‚Äúopposing‚Äù side than be a rational person. You let partisan conspiracy theories dictate your judgement. 

The simple fact is that voter ID laws literally cause more damage than they prevent, and the data I provided backs this up. 

&gt;	Why dont you try going to one of these urban areas and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt get an ID‚Äù to their face. Do you think it would go well?

Oh boy. Please tell me what you think would happen if I said that. This smells of blatant racism, so please prove my concerns unfounded. 

Assessment time:

Of course you‚Äôre just going to ignore everything I‚Äôve said and all the data. You don‚Äôt care about fact vs fiction, all that matters is that you get the policies you were told to want, with no regard for the cause or necessity. You shrugged off the data I provided because you aren‚Äôt concerned with facts. You‚Äôre an idealist through and through, with a good dose of ignorance of the problems outside your narrow circle. No data will convince you because your position is 100% emotional. 

In the end you know that I‚Äôm right and this isn‚Äôt a worthy cause, but you want the vote suppressed because you want that marginally further right wing nut job leading the country, because you‚Äôre too ignorant of politics to realize you‚Äôve been whipped into a frenzy over a virtually nonexistent difference in politics.

"gw7hema","&gt; I think you are really close with this. First, we have to understand that male and female have different value systems. And this affects everything in our lives.

Words typically spoken by those ignorant of cultures different from their own and ignorant of the individual.

Whatever correlative differences may or may not exist between genders, it pales in comparison to the difference that exists between different cultures.

This strip is Japanese; Japan is known to a particularly polite and conflict-avoiding culture. I am not Japanese, I am Dutch; the Netherlands is known to be a particularly rude and conflict-welcoming culture. ‚Äî this difference alone, of course acknowledging the individual variance in this regard between the individual Japanman and Dutchman, is far greater than anything sexes can ever hope to explain.

&gt; In her mind, she is justified to the things she did because he hurt her a lot. Whether she did it intentionally with En's circle to get back at him is debatable. Females are emotional beings. She probably questioned herself as a woman and tried it with the other guys. One thing let to the other due to still being in an emotional state or maybe not.

Whatever emotional nature females may or may not have yet again pales in comparison to different cultures.

In particular, Japan is generally a culture that frowns upon showing too much passion and emotion. ‚Äî the Japanman, male or female, is socially typically expected to remain calm far more than in many other cultures. Females in particular in Japanese cultures are socially expected to show even less emotion than the males.

&gt; This would go back to the different value system. Yumi, and most female would see this as justified. Not sure how En feels, if there is resentment, then he would be like most guys, unjustified.

I would find this ridiculous.

Yumi is an attention seeker with psychological problems and the story portrays it as such. Almost no one of any sex would find Yumi's reaction to be proportionate, at least from how Miyu narrates it, which is obviously En's experience of the story.

I am unconvinced by your attempt to paint some kind of gendered perception. ‚Äî almost anyone from how it is narrated from En's perspective would agree that Yumi went far too far over a rather simple remark, but the point is that this is only En's side of the story, and if Yumi's side were shown it would perhaps put things in a different light. It could include the following details that were omitted from En's side:

- Yumi was flirty with the entire group and slept with all of them already before En. En merely convinced himself that he was special when he wasn't.
- En had prior been making sexual advances to Yumi, thus indicating that Yumi felt it was appropriate to unbare and that En would be more receptive.
- From Yumi's perspective, En's face as he sees it is more visible, showing a clear face of disgust that isn't visible.
- They had a rather nasty argument afterwards where En was dis-proportionally mad.

All of such things are the kinds of things in a conflict that could be revealed if the other side of the story be heard, rather than only one, and none of them directly contradict any of the events show, but it would illustrate how one often leaves out such self-culpatory information when telling one's own side of the story.",1619637533,"words typically spoken by those ignorant of cultures different from their own and ignorant of the individual.","own and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"own and ignorant","own",NA,NA,0

"gvz2unw","I‚Äôve thought a lot about how to respond to your woefully ignorant and frankly offensive perspective.

To compare a woman being prevented from having an abortion to a man being prevented from raping someone is utterly vile.

Your assertion that in general, women are not harmed by being denied an abortion is uneducated and ignorant of reality.

If you acknowledge the risks and harms of pregnancy (wanted and unwanted) and childbirth but take a position that you don‚Äôt think it justifies an abortion then fair enough. I don‚Äôt agree but fair enough.

To deny that those harms exist, refuse to educate yourself on that topic and advocate to strip access to abortion makes you a coward.

Virtually every pregnancy and childbirth harms a woman‚Äôs body. While the numbers who die might be relatively small, the number who experience severe adverse near death situations is much higher. 

In Australia, that‚Äôs 1 in every 80 deliveries. That makes nearly being killed common. And most of those women will be left with injuries and permanent challenges - many of which makes future pregnancy much more dangerous.

This of course, does not include a huge variety of non-life threatening conditions and injuries, some of which will leave women with disabilities, reduced quality of life and additional complications.

The vast range of ways in which women with an unwanted pregnancy is huge.  You have no right to dismiss them.

Of course you don‚Äôt need to know me and I certainly don‚Äôt want to know you, but definitely you should know someone before judging them and making such rude and insulting remarks to them. Unless you‚Äôre just an asshole, at which point you wouldn‚Äôt care about any formalities like knowing what you‚Äôre talking about before dragging someone.

&gt;You are painting all police with a broad brush and say things like ""They aren't doing their jobs!!!"" and then stating what you think their job should be. 

I literally agreed with you on what the job of police should be.

&gt;You even contradict this point at times with the SCOTUS ruling and try to use ""Protect and Serve"" as their job when in fact they are not slaves so do not really serve on you hand and foot and the law itself prevents them from taking action in many cases. 

I‚Äôm not the one that says police should ‚ÄúProtect &amp; Serve,‚Äù that‚Äôs what THEY claim they are there to do. I didn‚Äôt come up with that slogan‚Äîthe police did. And lots of people were foolish enough to take them at their word, only to find out that the law doesn‚Äôt agree with their own slogan. None of that has anything to do with me.

See: mappingpoliceviolence.org

&gt;I see in a very small minority of police interactions what you are trying to paint all police with but they are usually prosecuted for this.

No, they‚Äôre not. Not at all. Chauvin being convicted is an anomaly.

&gt;Just because rich people currently benefit from police, as do people of all economic status, does not mean that they were CREATED to protect the wealthy which was your claim. 
&gt;Actually I know that asking you to back up one of your claims is unfair because you seem to not be able to do that.
&gt;Remember when the trans Atlantic slave trade police were not the ones selling, buying, transporting and exploiting slaves. In some cases they may have been part of the recovery process but in many cases they were not and the people doing the recovering were not always the most discerning when coming across people to bring back.

There, I just killed 3 of your stupid birds with one stone.

What exactly have I been dishonest about? Disagreeing with somebody doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre lying. You‚Äôre ridiculous. Do you know the difference between someone giving their opinion and giving a fact? Or are you a Fox News viewer?

&gt;The reason I can provide these links so easily is because what I am speaking about is true and I know what is going on.

I can provide links too all day long. Sometimes I just expect somebody to do a little goddamn research of their own, especially someone with as big a mouth as you have.

&gt;OH, that is right you have many excuses for not wanting to make easy money and help the community. LOL

I mean, wtf are you even talking about?

&gt;Police have not changed though and I am not expecting much to come out of the BLM movement except for police to be reigned back for lesser crimes which will hurt poor and minority communities more.

Well you‚Äôre wrong again, 4 more Black people have already been shot by police in just a few days since the verdict‚Äî3 unarmed, 3 died. Nothing has changed.

&gt;Neighborhood thugs preying on the elderly and weak.

Which, again, police do nothing to prevent.

&gt;It is none of your business you small minded bigot.

Ohohohoho, sheesh did I hit a nerve there?? Of course it‚Äôs none of my business, and I really don‚Äôt give two shits about knowing anything about you, however I was being polite and attempting to engage in an informed discourse, but obviously you‚Äôre not interested in anything but calling me dumb, naive, ignorant, and young‚Äîeven though I‚Äôm far from any of those things.

Actually, no because I‚Äôve answered your questions with no problem, you just don‚Äôt like the answers and so are trying to tear me down personally because you have no real defense or justification for the truth. Typical right-wing MO, so I‚Äôm sure I already know who you voted for.

&gt;But I am willing to bet you voted for Kamala Harris who as a prosecutor and district attorney was part of the system and supported the system or more likely were too young to vote. Hypocrite.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of your business you small minded bigot. LOL‚Äù But seriously, I don‚Äôt see how anyone could have voted for Kamala Harris, considering that VP candidates are automatically included on the ticket with the Presidential candidate. Did you even vote?

&gt;LOL, I doubt you get out your mom's basement much.

Wrong. But my mom actually lived in *my* basement for a while when I bought my first house 21 years ago. Then she married an old millionaire who died like 7 months after they got married, so now she‚Äôs got her own house(s).

&gt;Security jobs are legal 

I never said they weren‚Äôt. You missed my entire point that you claim that police in the US are paid so much better than police in other countries, so they are less likely to be corrupt. But so many of them do have 2nd and 3rd jobs, and are just as prone to corruption as police in other countries.

&gt;and the rest are just accusations from a child that watches too much TV, does not know the issue I am talking about and is trying to deflect because it is out of its league.

I don‚Äôt watch tv. I‚Äôm very familiar with the issue. I‚Äôm no where near being out of my league. I literally come from a family full of cops. I was raised by a cop surrounded by all his cop friends. All the males in my family are or were cops. My sister‚Äôs husband was a cop who was fired for refusing to fall in line with the corruption that is rampant in police departments everywhere. I have witnessed first-hand the corruption, cover ups, racial profiling, abuse, brutality, and murder that cops are capable of‚Äîand they got away with all of it. Don‚Äôt tell me I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. Fuck you.

&gt;Are you saying that there are LESS prisoners in the US than what is reported?

No.

&gt;I have never seen anyone say this in real life and the military budget is discusses A LOT.

Well, I guess because you‚Äôve never experienced it, it must not exist.

&gt;I never really have talked to anyone in real life about the police budgets nor does it get much news in the places I have lived?

Of course not. You‚Äôve already said you live in an ‚Äúaffluent neighborhood,‚Äù why would they care about police budgets as long as y‚Äôall are being protected like you expect?

&gt;But people do talk about the militarization of police which I think is a fair argument but it is a totally different argument.

It‚Äôs part of the same argument.

&gt;It is not just ""Da Republicans"" slashing school budgets.

Yes it is.

&gt;This is why I do not like talking politics 

No, you don‚Äôt like talking politics because like all conservatives, you can‚Äôt defend your positions.

&gt;small minded people like you are not actually interested in resolving the actual problem, just pointing at the other guy not resolving the problem‚Ä¶Your blaming other people does not resolve the problem just makes you feel better about yourself when in fact you do not care about the problem or resolving it.

I am very much interested in resolving problems. The problem is nearly half the people in this country can‚Äôt admit that THEY are the problem, and admitting the problem is the first step to changing it. 

&gt;This is just a deflection. If you were intelligent we could have an intelligent conversation. IF.

My intelligence isn‚Äôt the problem here.

&gt;Again you cannot support your made up statements. Mom's basement must be such a sheltered place.

Again, fuck you.

&gt;This is your opinion and the opinion. You are like a Qanon idiot that thinks they know how the world works because you surround yourself with other idiots and feed off of yourselves.

Sorry, your party is the one that bred the Q idiots.

&gt;But can you tell me what that has to do with the point you were addressing? It does not refute my point or even address it, it is just an attempt at a deflection?

I suggest you look up the definition of ‚Äúdeflect.‚Äù You keep using it a lot, but don‚Äôt seem to understand what it means. Proving you wrong isn‚Äôt a deflection.

&gt;I actually stopped watching the news because it is all negative and partisan. I like to read BBC.

Great way to get news about what‚Äôs going on in your country‚Äîread the news from another country! Sounds smart.

&gt;How do you know what most cops believe?

"gvoeq1i","This is a true and very glaring inconsistency amongst leftists and yes even some of the more statist minded republicans who just dont get what the whole point of MAGA is (if not Trump himself. I personally believe he was used and that they actually allowed him to win to forment a deep distrust against the movement. Hence constant pop culture and media coverage blaming him for everything especially covid.) 

Leftist and democrats made up a significantly large demographic in the conspiracy theory circuit for a very long time and to this day its part of their characteristic. ""Russia rigged the elections. Trump is going to start a nuclear war. North korea can destroy our country. Reagan created aids. Republicans dont want black people to vote"" 

Leftists have tons of conspiracy theories regarding aliens and the middle east and as i recall the 9/11 conspiracy stuff and the occupy stuff was all started by the left leaning grassroots. Individuals and whole movements evolved but leftists are the conspiracists and they blame republicans for everything but I remember when Alex Jones was talking like a leftie back in the day. He hated george bush lmfao we all did. 

THEN they started worshipping Obama and Hillary Clinton who succeeded in brainwashing the youth into being loyal statists. 

Now suddenly democrats are the PC party (which was once championed by guys like George HW Bush) they are the statist party, the taxation party, the big government party. And they are proud. If u ask democrats what a good citizen does theyll mention paying taxes early and voting early at least once. 

They talk about the sins of our government as if the government had nothing to do with it. Instead they put the blame on working class people and people who own small businesses. They attack US!!!! JP morgan and the people of Beverly Hills werent the ones boarding up their windows and closing early this week right? JP morgan is an ally now. And so is walmart and mcdonalds and GM and virtually every other major corporation. 

And now democrats are actively hating on small businesses. They call THEM priveleged. They threaten to literally kill landlords. They threaten cops openly on social media. Their heroes are attempted murderers and drug addicts who never turned their lives around. But then theyll bash Mike Lindell and Jordan Peterson for conquering their addictions. They call peaceful people like Rand Paul ""violent thugs"" i mean these people are insane. Theres no logic and the corporations and the state love it. They are clearly using them. They are directing this misplaced rage away from them and straight at us, the law abiding citizens who question the government and want accountability. 

These guys dont even blame the government when pll get shot. And ill give it to them some of these cases some of them SOME are legit examples of extrajudicial or even non judicial violence. I dont think Chauvin had the right to kill Lloyd but I dont think it was done on purpose. I think it was manslaughter because Floyd had breathing problems due to being a meth addict and having caught covid. But regardless of.Floyds past cops dont need to kneel on knecks. Arrest the guy but you have tasers and pepper spray, at least then u can make an argument its the equipments fault if u make a mistake. And yeah theres that stupid chick who pulled a taser instead of a gun. Best case scenario these ppl are still bad cops. Who is to.blame.for that? 

Big government! Statism! Those crooked individuals and the ppl who hired them and never looked into their past infractions. Not the police in and of itself. The police DO get away with more. If i made equivelent mistakes at my job id be fired or written up. Itd be some serious shit. 

When cops make mistake the system covers for them. That is a product of BIG GOVT. 

So i fail to understand the whole anti cop thing when democrats are the ones who push for policies and the kind of culture that worships govt workers and the govt itself and politicians. 

These bad cops come from liberal blue cities!!!!! Often from blue states! They are NOT running their police the right way and when shit blows up the state is deciding to throw the individuals under the bus only cuz the cameras are rolling. 

That being said, these ppl will.make violent killers their hero. There are actual innocent people who got shot by police that u can use as a symbol for ur movement. But they wana use george floyd. Why? Because Duncan Lemp and James Boyd arent black. The black teacher who got paralyzed wasnt anti cop and was protecting a white student. 

They want division. They dont care about actually solving these problems. These problems to them, are just an opportunity to force what they want. And they can direct rage at the middle class to justify the govt kowtowing even tho theyd do it anyway. Its awful. 

No one cares if I get killed during a robbery. No one cares if I get stabbed. 

That black girl was the hero of the story not the cop who saved the life of a man. Everyone wants u to say HER impossible name but no one wants to say the name of the person who almost died. 
They have redfined.everything. the media actually reported she was unarmed. 

The media and the state outlawed knives for self defense a LONG time ago. Theyre saying this girl was.defending herself from an unarmed person with a knife much longer than her palm which is illegal to carry around outside let alone to use for self defense unless its to get away from a life of death split second situation. This was not that. 
The cop did right. He is not Derek Chauvin he is a good cop who did a good thing. The verdict happenning at the same time is irrelevent. He probably didnt even know as he was on duty dealing with this BS. 

U can only blame society for not teaching kids that u cant run around outside with a kitchen knife and stab people who are having a simple argument that has nothing to do with u. She got scared and she acted in an ignorant and emotional way. That is partially her fault.partially the fault of the state who raised her. Shes an orphan. She is a product OF the government who didnt teach her their OWN laws. 

She grabbed a kitchen knife. Not a baseball bat, not a pole, not a shovel, her idea was not to block an attack or disarm someone, her idea was to STAB. She got scared and her initial reaction was to STAB and end a life rather than to get away, lock the door, she had an aggressive impulse. 

What part of that screams victim let alone ""heroine""???? 

How brainwashed and ignorant of the way the world works do u gotta be to actually believe this cop was just running around looking to kill a black person? 

Then they keep saying shes 16 as if 16 is 9. Its 16. Im a former gangbanger and a recovered addict. When i was 16 i was having sex, fighting, packing heat, slinging, i never hurt anyone innocent. But i know damn well what a 16 year old is capable of. The law defines what an adult is. That doesent mean that an arbitrary law gets to decide that 16 year olds arent young adults. 

U cant tell if someone is 16. This is why the law also tends to say that 16 is the age of consent and the point at which once can be tried as an adult. They just cant vote. Ur still a young adult. 

Shes not some innocent small 9 year old. She was a BIG and rather bulky young women armed with a large and very sharp kitchen knife. She inserted herself into someone elses argument. Yes she called the cops but she called them in a hysterical way and had no idea HOW to properly report a crime. She was just freaking out and escalating things because no one ever taught this young woman how to use her WORDS and how to remove herself or stay out of a situation. 

Let me say this again. It was the government who failed her. The government who ultimately had to kill her. 

But the people who the leftists blame and want to attack are working class white people. Especially working class white people who belong to a movement that distrusts that SAME government because of this exact same SHIT. 

These ppl cant see that because they dont THINK. They only feel. They only react. They come from a place they have dubbed as being politically ""correct"". They are right and we are the ""traitors"" which is a common insult ive been hearing since january. 

Suddenly theyre soooo patriotic.  But not in the values. In mere landmass. In the mere idea of abritrarily being a part of something. And to make it even more bizarre citizenship means jack to them. So long as u come and echo their views and hate who they tell u to hate then ur good. 

All sane democrats have left by now. The very few ppl who we love who are still democrats cannot be saved. They are brainwashed. We all have that relative or perhaps our whole family. We love them but they think we are the crazy ones. 

Its ironically an appeal to authority. Lol

"gvlhoxt","I deeply disagree with the second amendment, primarily because the writing of it and role it plays mean it serves no purpose in actually determining law, rather what is legal is determined in a highly partisan way. But then in a country even with an apolitical constitutional court, it would still be highly subject to interpretation (i.e. what constitutes an infringement of the 'right' to bear arms?). Guns are better regulated by specific laws in a system following the doctrine of implied repeal, in my opinion.

On the issue of guns themselves I'm rather conflicted. I'm under no illusions that a civilian populace could mount a successful resistance over a modern military fighting on its home turf. Arguing that military grade weaponry must be available for the resistance of tyranny is, in my opinion, deeply flawed and ignorant of the arguably greater power of peaceful protest. It's my opinion that violent attempts to resist a violent or fascist state would only end with egregious violence against the resistors, and greater repression against everyone else.

The proposition that criminals will always be able to obtain firearms is quite flawed in my opinion, where the case study in question is actually capable and willing to control it's borders, criminals would find it exceedingly difficult to obtain firearms and only those associated with organised crime would be capable of doing so on any kind of scale or with ease. It's also good to bear in mind that in somewhere with lax firearms laws, the difference between being an honest citizen and a criminal is a light squeeze of the trigger in a potentially emotionally charged situation, in somewhere with stringent regulations, the difference between an honest citizen and a criminal is buying the weapon, or evading the proper methods. The line is in a different place and is more obstructive to criminality because the situation is fat more rational.

As to preventing mass shootings, yes, a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun, but better that no-one has a gun in the first place, no? 

There are only two reasons which I entirely agree with for owning a firearm.

1. Target shooting 
2. Hunting

In light of these I come down heavily in favour of a UK-style gun control system. We have more lax restrictions on shotguns and other arms including historical arms, but much stricter restrictions on rifles and handguns. I especially approve of the nigh-ban on handguns we have, they are the most readily concealed firearm, and thus the most dangerous to the public.
Now there are some ways in which I might dial back restrictions, mostly revolving around caliber restrictions, most others I would keep.

If one tries to add self defence to that list, it suddenly becomes hard to enforce a UK-style system, to own a rifle for target shooting you first need to prove your interest, you must be a member of a shooting club or range. This is a problem sort of recognised in UK law, where it's illegal to carry a knife for the purpose of self defence. Self defence is effectively indistinguishable from hostile action, and unlike the other interests is usually unprovable. An interest to self defense would end up being presumed and there'd be no point in determining legitimate interest. The system would need to be turned upside down.

If I were designing this system I would remove the legitimate interest enquiry and replace it with mandatory and military training in the use of one's chosen firearm before purchasing. Furthermore I would use a pseudo-castle doctrine, allowing people to use their weapon for self defence in the home, but forbidding carrying of weapons for such purposes outside the home, you would need to have a provable interest.",1619203230,"arguing that military grade weaponry must be available for the resistance of tyranny is, in my opinion, deeply flawed and ignorant of the arguably greater power of peaceful protest.","flawed and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"deeply flawed and ignorant","flawed",NA,"deeply",0

I hate to break it to you but there are far more non-Ashkenazi Jews than not in Israel, so your claim that this is ""white supremacy"" makes zero sense demographically and is baseless in every other way. Whiteness in Israel is not a construct like it is in the US. It sounds like you are trying to apply a narrow lens of American politics where it does not apply. In fact, trying to lump Jews in with actual Nazis is a very popular form of vilification on the far-left that is wildly and overtly antisemitic. These comments are disgraceful not just to Israelis but to survivors of the Shoah. Moreover, reducing my ethnic identity to ""white"" simply for your rhetorical delegitimization erases my identity and culture, which is far more like white supremacy than anything happening in Israel.

You seem to have memorized a handful of the horrible things Israel has done in the past in an attempt to draw a through line to the present and disparage the Zionist movement by connecting it with a small contingent of degenerates and the actions of a select few in the government. Treating Israel as a monolith and saying Zionists want solely to eradicate Palestinians is absurd and ignorant of the politics within Israel. It is an insult to your own intelligence to paint a very complex entity in simplistic and villainous terms. Would you call the Palestinian liberation movement a terrorist movement because of the actions of Hamas? Do you even know what Hamas is?

Like many far-left Americans you only can think in terms of a handful of buzz words that you toss around interchangeably.  You talk about Jewish refugees as ""colonizers"" and weaponize the term ""pogroms"" against them, which is a very specific form of ethnic cleansing associated with Jews. Do you realize how degusting it is to accuse Jews fleeing porgroms of committing them? Do you care? The irony that you consider this colonialism in a region of the world that is majority Arab as a result of Arab supremacy and colonialism is almost laughable if it weren't so troubling. Only with regard to the I/P conflict is it acceptable to take an ethnic minority indigenous to an area of the world and call them colonizers and white supremacists.

This post is not a discussion, it is you dictating and accusing.

Could does not mean it is realistically possible. And for Canada it was not. Our society has norms that would not allow a strict government mandate to take place like we see in other countries. We cannot even make it through the current restrictions.

If it was so simple we would have done it. It's not.

My daughter (18) smokes weed, and i don't necessarily like it but she 18. I can't tell her not to smoke it at all, but i can tell her not to do it in my house. In the past i caught her smoking it in my house before, and I've given her warnings about it. Yesterday when i came home i could smell all through out the place. When i went into the living room she was smoking it with her boyfriend right beside my two sons (12, 8). She was supposed to be babysitting them, so the fact that she is doing it in my house right beside my 2 young son's pissed me off. I told her boyfriend to get out and told my sons to go to the basement (there's a game/play room down there). I told her that she was being disrespectful, and ignorant of what I told her. I said that this was my last warning to stop smoking in my house, and the next time she does it I'm kicking her out. She told me that i couldn't tell her what to do because she was an adult. I said "" your right your an adult, but it's not yout house it's mine, and if i told you not to do something in my house then either you don't do it or you can get out of MY HOUSE"".

You are wrong to attribute income gaps to IQ, that is proven false, particularly in places like the US where there are massive socio-economic divisions that date back to 400 years of chattel slavery Jim Crow policies, with deeply ingrained racism that denies equal opportunities in almost all areas of life in our highly segregated society. IQ tests are racist tests created out of the eugenics movement, and they ignore the socio economic factors and how they play into mental development and education.

Black patients are statistically more likely to have their pain discounted than white patients, and are more frequently turned away and have their problems ignored as exaggerations than white patients and have higher rates of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. They used to teach that Black people had higher pain thresholds and therefore were given less anesthetic or none at all and were subject to harsher procedures. There is a mountain of evidence for this and historical literature in medicine espousing these views.

Would that be a lesser atrocity?

His ideology is toxic and hateful and ignorant of history and stupid. I don't think he means that Hitler was right to kill Jews (but I don't disagree that that's a side effect), but I don't think he should *need* to be talking about Jews for us to recognise the problem here.

He should have lost his position years ago. It shouldn't take Jews complaining and playing the victim card for him to be fired. I he could say what he said about White people, he should be allowed to say it about Jews (even though it's wrong and he shouldn't).

What's worse is that Riot has Seraphine ignore the voice and not explore why these crystals are talking. I can undertand it's because they want Seraphine to be more focused on the Piltover/Zaun conflict, but having the story gloss over the fact that someone knows the crystals that power the city are alive and conscious doesn't give Seraphine a good image. To be clear this a criticism for the story and not the character

Now that Seraphine can't really hear the Brakern, she can focus on being a unifier for the two cities without having the controversy of ignoring the Brakern. However this leads to another criticism. We all know this: Seraphine's goal is to unite the two cities by singing songs that can help people ""find their voice,"" in other words she wants to make people feel good via songs that resonate with them. It's great that someone is trying to prevent a civil war between the cities but I find her methods very naive and ignorant of the real issues of class disparity and systematic exploitation of the working class, which is a valid reason to dislike the character but not the story.

"gtp2iqi","&gt;That's passage is helpful for determining an appropriate approach to unbelievers in evangelism.

I would submit that *every relationship is evangelism for the Christian*\--to the believer (Heb 10:24) and unbeliever (1 Pet 2:9-).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But does it really help us answer the original question about friendship with unbelievers?  I don't see how it does, other than the need to be humble and gracious when speaking about the gospel to them.

Then you didn't pay close enough attention to u/ktvietnam's original reply. u/ktvietnam has a non-Christian friend who's behavior has convinced u/ktvietnam that this friend is *not an enemy of God.* You rightly challenged that conclusion, but you didn't deal with the apparent contradiction that u/ktvietnam is struggling with: How can we call non-believers enemies of God when so many of them know we are his followers, and they still accept us as friends? 

The reason is because these non-Christians have been ""suppressing the truth"" (Rom 1:18) their whole lives, and so they grow up blind and ignorant of their sins (Rom 1:21-22). Some do so actively (like the Pharisees) because they hate the truth they see in God's law, and other passively (like the Athenians) because they grew up without the Scriptures; but ultimately both are enemies because they do not glorify God as they know they ought to (Rom 1:19-20).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But how to speak to them is a very different matter than whether or not unbelieving Athenians can be our close friends.

When considering friendships, it helps to understand that even the most well-meaning non-believer is blind, and following their example will end in destruction (Luke 6:39). At the same time, Jesus took pity on the blind and lost, and shared the gospel with them rather than simply destroying them as enemies. 

I believe this is the stance we are to take take towards friendships with non-believers: We must guard ourselves against following their example and practices, but when God gives us non-Christian family or neighbors, we are to share the light of the gospel through our lives and words. We should not automatically treat them as enemies (how could we keep ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" if we did?), but strive to live at peace while avoiding any bond (marriage, partnerships, etc.) that would  be likely to bond us in sin.",1617808346,"the reason is because these non-christians have been ""suppressing the truth"" (rom 1:18) their whole lives, and so they grow up blind and ignorant of their sins (rom 1:21-22).","blind and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"blind and ignorant","blind",NA,NA,0

"gtfjtze","&gt;some laborers actually prefer to have regularity of payments in the present in the form of wages or salaries

Some do, but most don't have that choice in the first place. And in practice most of the risks are transferred to the workers because of limited liability and corporate welfare, while most of the rewards are reaped by the capital owners.

It's also the result of over a century of propaganda and of various systems designed to force workers into wage labor. When wage labor was first introduced, most people saw it as the oppressive and unfair system that it is. It took a lot of effort for the ruling class to change that state of mind. One of the main reasons people ""choose"" *relative* security is because the increase in the cost of living has them locked in debt. The overwhelming majority of people cannot own a home without going into decades-long debt. At which point it becomes prohibitively risky for them to quit the wage labor system.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Actually yes and the fact that you don't recognize effective control and only emphasize formal control is a shortcoming of the entire communist  worldview. Capital owners cannot force purchase of the product of that  capital. There is good reason that an adage of market economists is that  ""the consumer is king."" 

I'm not a communist. Explain to me *exactly* how a person with no capital has any effective control in a free market system. Capital owners can force people into purchases when they have a monopoly or an oligopoly, and can manipulate people into purchases even when they don't have that. And ""*Serve the people !*"" is the motto of the Chinese communist party, that's not an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Capital owners aren't the bosses. Consumers are the bosses.

You are quite delusional and ignorant of history if you actually believe that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Besides, millions of average Americans invest all of the time.

About 84% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% in the US. Over half of it is owned by the top 1%. And the majority of the people on the planet don't have any stake whatsoever in the stock market. Insignificant stakes are also nothing but placebo. Owning 1 share of Apple does not give you any meaningful control, nor does it constitute any meaningful income or wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No amount of capital accumulation will make a venture profitable if consumers just simply aren't buying what is being sold.

The vast majority of the wealth on earth is directly or indirectly derived from land. Land is a finite, and currently shrinking, resource. Land is needed to live. It is impossible to survive on your own without land. This allows capital owners to extract rent, and forces everyone else to submit to them. You don't need to be efficient at all when what you own is inherently valuable and people cannot live without it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The median income in the US is quite high and the size of the middle and  upper classes is growing and is larger than the bottom income brackets  that delineate poverty. 

The median income in the US isn't even half of the average income. The size of the middle class is completely meaningless because the definition is arbitrary. Looking at income is also intentionally deceptive. Wealth is the far better metric, but income is always used because the numbers are not as bad and are more easily manipulated. Half of the US owns less than 2% of the wealth. The same amount owned by the richest 50 Americans. When looking at the entire world, the top 0.6% of humanity owns significantly more wealth than the bottom 95%.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They do not choose between ""food or no food"", but specific units of food now versus specific units of something else as an alternative now.

If you acknowledge that people don't choose to eat food, how can you fail to understand that it means food consumption isn't a choice ? Having a choice of different brands of food doesn't mean that eating food is a choice. People are forced into food consumption by biological imperatives. They -have- to buy from the food industry. If the entire industry used bad practices, people wouldn't be able to boycott it. They couldn't choose to stop eating food. Demand for food is inelastic, which opens the door for monopolies and oligopolies. And in practice it's exactly what happens, the ""choice of brand"" often means a choice between 2 different products ultimately owned by the same entity or a very small group of entities. The very fact that millions starve to death when food production exceeds global demand by over 30% is proof that the food industry does not follow market laws. Such a massive production surplus should make food affordable to even the poorest individuals. It doesn't because the price of food doesn't follow theoretical market laws, because food consumption isn't a luxury.

&gt;  
&gt;Not if you understand economics. 

How can I answer such strong logical arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Besides, even if we accept your misunderstood cartoon version of  libertarianism, when communists start talking about ""the common good"",  what they mean is ""the thing I want for me and my friends."" 

Once again, not a communist. What I meant was the common good as defined by utilitarianism. I was pretty unambiguous about it.

 

&gt;The failure to internalize externalities is a failure of the state to enforce rules against harm. A libertarian environmental legal code would arguably be far more restrictive than the current one.  
&gt;  
&gt;Externalities also aren't limited to market systems, so using them as a criticism of markets is just disingenuous.

States have successfully addressed externalities to a far greater degree than any market ever has. That's why people in countries with strong environmental regulations enjoy much cleaner air, water, and food than people living in countries without strong environmental regulations. Markets had 70+ years to fix the poisoning of the air by leaded fuels. They didn't. Governments stopped it. The market answer to externalities was tobacco companies producing fake medical studies denying the health impact of their products, despite knowing about it for decades, or oil companies producing propaganda denying man-made climate change. 

Externalities aren't limited to market systems, but market systems don't have any way to deal with them, whereas other systems do, which is a legitimate criticism.

That's how game theory disproves market theories. Individual entities acting in their own self-interest does not necessarily lead to the best outcome, even just for those entities without accounting for externalities. It's objective proof that some form of central coordination is needed to reach the most optimal outcome.",1617608993,"you are quite delusional and ignorant of history if you actually believe that.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt;besides, millions of average americans invest all of the time.","delusional and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"quite delusional and ignorant","delusional",NA,"quite",0

"gtceugm","BTW - if you want to hear an ear-splitting silence out of Morris (with its amp on eleven) - just ask him: 

Whatever happened to his celebrated involvement with Stamets' ""I'm Innocent And Had Nothing To Do With Pollock's Murder"" story, pointing fingers of suspicion at patsy voices on that certain hokey audio cassette tape.

Specifically as of that caper's immediate post-\*Harpers\* article stage (2013) where Morris announced to fandom his impending book all about it?  Complete with a publication contract (a 'funny' publisher for 'such a deal' MacSweeny's).  And photographs of the 'book deal' contract that he displayed on his social media.

Case in point, one inquirer here at reddit - given the 'ignore it and maybe it will go away' routine - OP u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019):

\*Morris wrote an... article ""Blood Spore"", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of ""mushroom doctor"" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: [https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/](https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/) \[In\] Podcast appearances he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning \[it\] into a book, as documented by his tweet: [https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856](https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856)  What happened to the book?\*

Book schmook - what happened to Morris' reply to that little question?

Oh wait - my mistake.  There never has been any reply. Not a peep out of Morris about it.  Look high, look low no matter where you go, all dead silence.

So there's just another Morris X-File, to go with yours. One of conspicuously glaring appearance.  

Especially in view of how suspicious Stamets' entire theater of drama is that it revolves around - all up into ""It Wuz Cops Who Killed Pollock.""  Staged with 'evidence' (that idiotic audio cassette tape) so apparently fabricated, so transparently faked (by all indications top to bottom) it makes the conjuring of the infamous Roswell 'briefing documents' - by a package with no return address (containing photos of the 'smoking  gun' papers) mysteriously mailed to gullible (if not complicit) 'UFO researcher' Jamie Shandera - look like the mastermind forgery of the century by comparison. 

At least there's a familiar modus operandi, tried and true as tested and applied in previous Scooby Do capers. A clear pattern the entire thing matches. But only to the tee.

[http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html)  &lt; Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI‚Ä¶ crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers‚Ä¶ 162 victims &gt;

As Schlessinger said, in an episode of UP AND VANISHED podcast - and compare with Stamets in Morris' ""Blood Spore"" profile as a Person of Interest (and Morris either a gullibly 'useful idiot' or knowing willing accomplice):

&gt;most victims who get killed know the offender‚Ä¶ the vast majority of murders \[involve\] people closely connected‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim‚Ä¶ Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they‚Äôre smarter than law enforcement‚Ä¶ when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said ‚ÄúI know not, I‚Äôm not my brother‚Äôs keeper.‚Äù That‚Äôs the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who‚Äôs more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous \[example\], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. \[Until\] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader‚Äôs narcissism‚Ä¶ &gt;

As in real life, so in 'true crime' fiction - it's a well worn storyline:

The Beug/Stamets ""Evergreen State Kollege"" partnership has a record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics. Even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Case in point the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;*the student* \[never mind his name btw\] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended ‚ÄúThe Hollywood Bandit,‚Äù a notorious Western Bank Robber ‚Äì and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 [https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM\_HistoryFutureLR.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf) \[Psst - in fact &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound.

To get Morris explaining whatever happened to his MacSweeny's BLOOD SPORE book deal - the contract all signed, sealed and delivered as shown off by Morris 8 years ago on his twitter page - only to UP AND VANISH without a trace - would take a subpoena.

You have, in multiple points, said that an argument has been provided.

I have never said that no claims have been made. In fact, my very specific problem is that the claims raised are not argued for.

&gt; stified their claim that objective morality is definitionally impossible with logical argumentation 

I asked for their argument. Why haven't you provided it here?

It seems like the easiest way to defeat my position here would be to directly quote their comment that has argumentation. And I made that point and asked you to do it.

If you can't, it looks like I'm right.

&gt;previous comment

Keep reading.

I say two important things about this afterwards:

1. There are people who disagree with you whose arguments I'm sympathetic to. This matters because it now means we cannot accept this premise as universally held or universally intuitive. You must provide reasons!
2. I talk about how I am a Motivational Internalist. This means I think that moral propositions are necessarily linked to a desire/motivate to actualise them. **This does not mean that I think moral claims are value judgements.** 

We've been through both of these before, and recently. In our second conversation, you had trouble remembering any details from the first. Part of why interacting with you is not something that is rewarding or stimulating is because you seem unable to understand the points you bring up *even after* you've been told what they mean.

In the last comment I wrote:

&gt; The answer is, right now, a loud ""no"". Why think that Goodness and Badness *require* value judgements? What is morality? What are value judgements? What kind of qualities to value judgements have? What kind of taxonomy are we fitting these into? You also have to justify your answer to these questions. 

You've tried to answer one of these by misinterpreting what I've said after clarification then making the outstanding - **and unjustified claim** \- that ""It's also plainly obvious to anyone with a shred of honesty."" This is a claim that comes about for two reasons:

1. You're not careful with your words
2. You haven't done any fucking work and so have no clue what anyone in the field is saying

Let's examine it a little more closely:

1. X is better than Y
2. X is a moral good, and moral goods are better than Y since Y is a moral bad.
3. X is a personal good, and while Y is a moral good ""X is better than Y."" 
4. X is a moral obligation, but following it leads to suffering. Y is not a moral obligation but it increases happiness. ""X is better than Y if and only if we value X over Y."" 

These all contain radically different meanings. I think the second is what we're talking about, but it also doesn't really look like it contains a value judgement analogous to aesthetical value: It looks closer to saying ""5 is higher than 4."" It has more ""moral value"" which doesn't look like ""personal value."" 

**But you shouldn't reply to this because you didn't give a good reason to think your belief is true. Making a psychological claim about the honesty of people's views is always going to be rough but you one-upped that: you made that claim about** ***everyone's views when you haven't read anyone!***

And notice how little of the quote we got through. I just want to repeat what you've done is bad argumentation, but it also just isn't sufficient.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we can construct another argument here:

1. Someone who makes claims (X,Y) is necessarily arrogant.
2. You have made claims (X,Y).
3. You are necessarily arrogant.
4. Someone who makes claims (P,Q) is necessarily ignorant of the topic.
5. You have made claims (P,Q).
6. You are necessarily ignorant of the topic. 
7. Engaging with someone who is arrogant and ignorant of the topic is not something I should do.
8. I should not engage with you.

&amp;#x200B;

We've gone through one and two already. The claims that I think you've made that are arrogant is that you've proposed that you can add good insight into the topic when you have done no work on the topic. I also think the claims you've made about the honesty of those in the field are arrogant: it is arrogant to claim that these positions are widely held when you haven't done a survey or even had a cursory look.

Three follows from one and two.

You've kinda confessed to 4 and 5. You've said you haven't done any research. You routinely show a misunderstanding of terms, and how these terms are used. You don't seem to know any arguments, and more than once you've had your view named and described back to you. I think I've even given you some anti-realist arguments before. Of course, these don't come forward now. Instead, we get bizarre claims about the psychology of all ethicists.

Six follows from 4 and 5.

There are a few routes to justifying 7. I take it to be related to the argument in my previous comment, though: I think that if I value my time and sanity I should better pick who I argue with.

8 follows from the rest of the argument.

The point was that my opposition to him just drives us apart, so I see him less, therefore I get less of a chance to counter him, all the while he gets more stubborn, close minded and conservative.

I could work my ass trying to covert someone like him but he's in his bubble and will hear so many more voices reinforcing his views rather than opposing them, I have very little chance to make a difference with him.

I'm not saying it's like this all the time, but it's a common real world problem, and I'm not claiming to have a solution either. It is worth trying, but opposition does not always work, and can be even more polarising and distancing.

I don't think the other movements you mentioned went smooth, I did not say that either. But they weren't necessarily won by convincing people's dads were they? Not necessarily even close friends. Much of the progress was achieved in public, in front of TV cameras, with like minded people protesting and lobbying. The civil rights movement wasn't exactly won by having stern words with our mates.

"gt7p2p7","For me, it was a mix of things over the past year or two. I was raised Catholic but throughout high school came to denounce it amidst my depression and anxiety. Last February sparked a bunch of bad things for me, relating to depression and whatnot. Honestly the pandemic didn‚Äôt worsen it, but other things related to that made it worse. It was to the point where it was basically pointless.

During the months and months of quarantine, I got really into history, some philosophy, reading some books, etc etc. 

I realized that essentially (and I admit this relates specifically to Christianity or religion in general)
1.) I had this idea that all past eras/generations were dumber than us, and assumed that their faith and religion was just them being dumb and ignorant of the ‚Äútrue carelessness‚Äù of the world. Learning more of history and philosophy and theology made me realize that all my atheistic arguments were pretty answerable or the lack of answers was explainable by theology and such.

2. those people of the past were not dumb at all, and these arguments I had have basically been explained away since the first few centuries AD.

3. The Bible is Literature, and not every detail should be taken literally, and the writers of both the Old and New Testament knew that some of the things they were writing were contradictory/easily proved wrong. Likewise, the Gospels dont all line up, but thats not cuz the writers made a mistake, its cuz they knew there were inconsistencies and had reasons for making them. 

That was the first part. So after kinda getting thru the personal ignorance and misunderstanding parts, I realized that my depression was almost born out of some of the fundamental themes of religion: Beauty and Love. Knowing that one of the most fundamental and indisputable messages of the Bible is ‚ÄúLove thy neighbor‚Äù showed me that the Bible is not about hate and is really, fundamentally, about treating the world well and loving everyone else on it. Evil exists, yes, and suffering exists, but even the Son of God himself was crucified. No one makes it out wonderfully. 

My older brother also helped me to realize that all this beauty, emotion, and love is something so.... divine and beautiful that it cannot be fully explained. And he taught me how science and religion are NEVER in conflict; nothing from science has proved the Bible wrong, and being Christian does not mean you have to denounce science, including evolution, vaccines, etc.

Another problem I had with Christianity was like, the anti-LGBTQ+ messages and accepting slavery and other ideas that went against treating all people fairly and equally. But I came to realize that there are arguments based in history that show why these things are in the Bible.. Essentially, God does not want to just make us all good and perfect, he wants us to choose that; In order to willingly get people to follow and accept him in history, part of that meant conforming only some of their ways of life. God never speaks of slavery and being against LGBTQ+ as the right way, but the Bible‚Äôs hints of it are products of it being a historical piece of Literature. Slavery was a custom for civilization when the Old Testament was written, so it would not have been questioned back then. Not everything from the Bible should necessarily be taken as Gods word. Like yes, it all is holy but that doesn‚Äôt mean the specifics apply today. If they did, then slavery would be allowed, clothes made out of more than one material would be sinful, and we should be making more regular animal sacrifices. But we don‚Äôt, and the Vatican isn‚Äôt saying we SHOULD. Again, I bring it all down to Jesus‚Äôs fundamental lesson to being a good Christian: ‚ÄúLove thy neighbor.‚Äù and by loving everyone around you, you also show your love for God. Just be nice and love everyone. Expel hate.

Finally, I took a theology class and read some CS Lewis books that cemented all this and closed off any final gaps in reason. The theology class explained Genesis, the customs of the church, and tied up the loose ends. One of these was the fact that the Church itself isn‚Äôt sinful, but that‚Äôs cuz the Church is essentially the connection to God, while everyone, including the pope, priests, and all the regular people, are just members of the church. The members of the church are sinful and can easily be evil. Many priests have committed horrible acts, including pedophiliac acts amongst other things.   The church is separate from its sinful members. All the people who are hating LGBTQ+, believe in hate and hating other religions, saying Islam is dangerous‚Äîthey are not following that fundamental lesson of Loving thy neighbor. The history of the Church is one of sin and hate‚Äî countless persecutions, murders, etc. But that does not mean these people were doing the right thing. Any act of hate is an act against the Bible. Jesus taught Love, and any act‚Äî whether it be hating one political group, a race, a sexuality, another religion, etc. is against the Bible. There is no excuse. Forgiveness and Love are the idea. Even the most evil people are to be treated with love and kindness and forgiveness. Learning about certain personal stories taught me this‚Äî people who forgave murderers of loved ones; people who showed love and changed them; people who were reformed by love, etc. When you break it all down, its about unrelenting and unconditional Love for all humans, and with that comes all beauty and glory of life; This revelation is what came to me to believe in God and become a faithful person, even though I may not agree with the actions of many people in the same church as I am.",1617422252,"i had this idea that all past eras/generations were dumber than us, and assumed that their faith and religion was just them being dumb and ignorant of the ‚Äútrue carelessness‚Äù of the world.","dumb and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"dumb and ignorant","dumb",NA,NA,0

&gt;not communism because people already tried that and it didn't turn out so well. Or will it be different this time?

Why did it fail? Certainly the USSR and China turning into autocratic one party states is an indictment against Leninsim and Maoism. But against communism or even socialism? There are numerous other ideologies under these umbrellas with completely different track records and to lump them all in as communism and then say communism is what failed is just incorrect and ignorant of the whole picture.

None of these are utopian but all offer great advice about what is and isn't possible. Some are still around. Some aren't. Some are on a small scale. Some worked for millions of people. You could say that Spain failed because they were crushed by international coalition (involving the US and USSR). But did it fail because of its ideology? Because life improved for the people there under many metrics even during wartime until it was destroyed. George Orwell (writer of 1984/animal farm) went to fight in this conflict and wrote a book about his experiences and was a lifelong socialist afterwords. Saying we tried communism and it failed is such a black-and-white and completely nuance-lacking way of addressing questions regarding its legitimacy and no historian, political scientist, or philosopher would ever say something so silly. You can point to specific reasons for their failure: sanctions, war, corruption of leninist vanguard etc. But to pretend like all forms of communism or socialism failed so we shouldn't try them is to pretend to care about the scientific method and empiricism while discarding the rhetorical scalpel and replacing it with the hammer.


You saying that you would rather be on the side that does the destroying is a bit worrying to me though because you are saying you care more about winning than being good.

I think what guys like Marx were missing was the other end of that equation. Living standards for the poor have gone up in ""Capitalist"" (a term I despise in its one dimensional simplicity) societies, not down. The labour theory of value doesn't take into account the synergy of production- the economy isn't a fixed pie. It is an ever expanding one under the right circumstances and arrangements. The rich are not rich at the expense of the poor *most* of the time.

The philosophy that Engels, Marx, Luise and Karl Kautsky, Luxemburg, and co. Developed is fundamentally ignorant, and poorly contrived. It views all social and economic arrangements in western society as being based off of a power struggle - with a vaguely defined oppressed class and a vaguely defined ruling class. I think it is just extraordinarily two dimensional, and ignorant of what we can observe in other sciences. 

Still,.from.epistemological point of view, I find Marxism interesting in that it was a social and political movement that did gain significant support in the early 20th century.

"gssthdj","**hot take:** Bec is being extremely reckless and inconsiderate for the position she's putting Melissa in. Every time Bec demands apologies, Melissa's thoughts, or tries to be ""honest"" in the public forum, Bryce sees that as another opportunity to exert power and win one up. We can see that this has gotten to the point where Melissa is isolated from the group by Bryce as he is that distrustful of the group.   


Rule #1 of DV is that you don't put the victim on the spot to air their grievances in front of the abuser - that's going to expose them to danger, and any time it won't go the way the abuser wants it, they're going to punish the victim. If you want to help them, you pull them aside confidentially and safely.   


Bec wants the circle jerk that she gets from humiliating Melissa in public, which is all the more why Bryce gets to paint the picture as Bec as the ""bully"", and not Bryce as the asshole who flirted with another woman at the gym.   


However, it's important that the entire group stood up to Bryce after he sexually assaulted Melissa, that was absolutely disgusting. The behaviour needed to be called out then and there.   


And we must remember that ultimately Bryce is responsible for everything here, not Bec or Melissa. Bryce is the dickhead who gets called out and flips it to paint himself as a saint and justify that ""it's you and me against the world"". I just think that knowing the power dynamic between Bryce and Mel, that Bec has been reckless and ignorant of how her *style* of approach could and had endangered Melissa.

"gr47w0c","He was known as Barra the kind. The man who sacrificed himself for the village. But one day, he showed up to my dark dungeon, bruised and cut, screaming, ""Where are you, great Demon? Come on out. Come burn this damned village down. Turn it into ashes, make it disappear from the face of Earth.""

It took me a moment to gather my wits. The man who had, for the past five years, agreed to take a hundred lashings every month to save the village from doom, asking to burn it down to a crisp. How bizarre. The kindest man in the world with such barbaric thoughts.

""Do you know, what you're asking of me, Barra? Do you have your wits about you?""

""I sure have my wits about me, Demon. I have my wits about me. Only now do I feel they have returned. Why did I ever take those lashings? All that for such horrid people. Listen, burn them. Burn me with them if you like.""

I could only laugh. ""Burn you? You're the kindest person I have ever had the honor of lashing. I could never burn you. But I am curious, what on Earth changed you so Barra?""

""What do I say, Demon. What can I say? Those vile creatures for whom I took these lashings on my body. I want to tear this skin that suffered for that lot.""

His demonic spirit made me smile, ""Out with it, Barra. That is my condition. Tell me why, and I'll do as you please.""

""Why, you ask, why, you should've asked why not. Those people, they said I killed the boy with yellow fever when I nursed him in his illness. They said I was vile, and the Demon had made me a carrier of curses and diseases. They rejected my kindness, those fools. They rejected it out of their own vileness. Tell me, Demon, do such people have any right to live?""

""No. Not at all. Nor does the rest of the human race. It's all the same everywhere, you know.""

""I believe you, I believe you now. Should all of the race be wicked, then we should eliminate all!""

I nodded my head and got up from the throne. ""Come with me, Barra. I want to show you carnage, the destruction of those who refuse your supreme kindness.""

With Barra resting on my shoulder, we walked over to the village, where I crouched for Barra to get down on the ground.

The villagers watched us with curious expressions as if they didn't know what they'd done, but Barra, his face was contorted with rage.

""Die! Die, you villagers! Insolent and ignorant of greatness among you. Die, vile humans!"" Barra shouted at the top of his voice.

Right on cue, I drew a deep breath and exhaled giant flames, which caught on the thatched roofs of the village huts, and soon the whole village was in flames. I hunted every villager that escaped and burned them to crisp.

The manic eyes of Barra, the flames shining in them, told me that my intuition was correct. He was indeed the kindest man I had ever seen.

"gqwoomy","That it's perfectly okay, but it won't be easy. For women, we're judged by procreation, and that does not change for the entirety of your life. People automatically assume that you're broken, not complete, can't be compassionate, or are sad and depressed when none of the above is true. We're judged even harsher if we state that we chose not to have kids. Then we're bitches, selfish, rude, and ignorant of how the world works. If we're single and sleep with a guy just for sex, we're a slut, we should settle down and have babies. 

Men are judged by the women they're with. If they sleep around, they're just 'having a little fun', but once they marry, they're expected to do their duty. If they don't, they're judged or badgered about sperm count or asked what's wrong with their wife.

For both sexes, the 'you don't have kids - you can work the long weekend' mentality kicks in.

You'll constantly be bombarded by people telling you what to do in your own bedroom, with your dick or ovaries, and judge you accordingly. You'll have to tell people repeatedly to shut up about it, but then you're considered defensive. 

When you get older to grandchild age like I am, you'll be judged as lonely, a spinster, a lifelong bachelor. You'll be suspected of being gay, even if you're not. You'll be judged on why you didn't do IVF or surrogacy or adopt. You'll have realised by this point that people see you as miserable, can't make friends, super lonely and they'll ask you if you regret your choice.

And the biggest thing to know about all of the above? Not one drop of it matters. Not a damned bit. I'm PROUD to be CF. I'm happy and well adjusted. I'm single, live alone, and have for many years. Pre-Covid, I was super busy in my community, and quite capable of handling people and their dumb questions.

The friends I do have know me and respect my choices, as I respect theirs. I have friends with kids, but they're distant. My best friends are those without kids. And I don't judge on age. My best friend is 14 years younger than I am. My best couple friends are in their very early 20s and they see me not only as a friend but a mentor. They don't want kids either and are wicked D&amp;D players.

The worst years were in my late 20s, when I was married for about 7 years. The pressure was intense, especially from his side of the family. Didn't cause our divorce but was a part of it, and I won't marry again - and that's okay. 

That's the biggest takeaway I wish someone had told me: It's okay. It's going to be okay, and it will be okay. You'll survive the constant bingoing of your 20s, the loss of friends in your 30s as they have kids and fall away, and the comments about grandkids later. It really is okay.

1) Technically men already have a finite number of sperm they can release-ditto for woman and eggs-before they die, even if they wank it every day, as death would ultimately put an end to any and all sperm production.

I‚Äôm assuming the same still happens in this hypothetical, just on a faster timeline for sperm producers versus egg producers. So then it becomes the issue of viable sperm that no longer gets produced, As in sperm that is healthy enough to create the end result of a healthy fetus that gets carried to term successfully. Maybe after a hard set age or amount of ‚Äúuse‚Äù the sperm gets too damage so it never results in a pregnancy, our sped up sperm longevity time line, so Basically after a certain age or use amount you‚Äôd be guaranteed to ‚Äúshoot blanks‚Äù.

If you can be taken advantage of, it is someone's right to take advantage of it. While Canada expects the world to follow rules of law and justness in good faith, that side of world is ruled by predetory relationship b/w powerful and powerless. Small fish will get eaten by big and morality has no place in this eat or get eaten world. 

They think Canadians and naive and ignorant of this competition to not just survive but to be the all winning player, no matter the destruction left behind. Thats the only way they can understand Canadian 'niceness', an inherent weakness to be exploited. Chinese can push forward Chinese(or CCP) causes even at cost of Chinese populace, show me where Canada has such fervent dedication to any of their causes. We have diluted our collective identity in favour of individual freedoms and identities. Over there its still China first for every citizen, wheather they like it or not. We are fighting the CCP monster with 1.5+ billion pieces to move, manipulate and sacrifice against a paltry 35 million people with varied idealogies, allegiences and similarily shaped leaders with varied policies and plans. Theres no match, especially when we have already let them in our economy, business, politics and society with no checks and bounds. What measures do we have to check against an ex CCP loyalist coming over and following his/her instructions spread over 20 years.

Theres no one group to be blamed for this situation. Consumers, corporations, politicians, they all looked out for personal interests while being played like a toy at the hands of CCP. Democratic governments change here every few here and so changes their plans and aspirations. CCP does not have that discontinuity, its contant and ever improving organism. What is Canada's continously living and evolving external idealogy, that we work on regardless of party in power? Wait and see what happens in arctic North once the ice clears but more.

Conflict does not ensue because simply one person has an issue. Nor does war break out because two tribes exist. Two tribes must exist, but one must have a problem with the other, and neither be willing to compromise or listen for the betterment and safety of it's people. 

The problem, and I do agree, a civil war is seemingly inevitable. And your example is just, and valid. 

But you are just as much a part of the problem as the ones you claim to be preparing against. 

Pointing fingers and waiting to claim ""They started it."" You, and anyone else to takes to name calling, and placing blame, will be just as much to blame when all the dust settles.

Peace is created by listening, compromising, and diplomacy. Generosity, and love. Making a stand on the important issues, and creating a resolution on the ground which can be shared. 

This is as much a war cry as Conservatives make. Constant name calling and degradation tactics to prove ""I'm right, you're wrong."" And if blood sheds, it will dry equally on both sides of the knife which cut the skin. Blood and skin, that no matter which color, identity, or ideology, all bleeds red.

"gql0dlo","What do you mean by ""born as a biological male""? I have provided you studies that trans women don't seem to be the typical biological male to begin with. Additionally, ""born as biological male"" does not per se provide you performance advantages. Compare cis boys and girls. There is virtually no strength difference between them. The differences come with puberty. The evidence does seem to point out that advantages trans women might have because of puberty seem to vanish if they go through HRT through a substantial time (usually 2 years).

There is also the problem that losing the advantages of male puberty can put you into a serious disadvantage. If trans women have a bigger skeleton you need more muscles to move them around. If you lose those muscles, then you need more energy to move your body around (also calles ""big car, slow engine""). If hemoglobin levels drop due to HRT then you VO2max drops as well. So even if trans women have larger lungs than cis women they cannot use them appropriately. If trans women go through SRS then their testosterone levels drop far below cis womens standards, because trans women then only have one source of androgene production (adrenal glands) while cis women produce androgenes additionally through their ovaries.

I'm wondering, though, when you mention that... what were people expecting to find?

We didn't develop cislunar flight to support the enthusiasts and scientists, but rather the geopolitical types. We already knew Luna was a wilderness (well, definitely after the Surveyor landings in the late '60s). Why should people have been surprised by that, and why would they consider it significant when the nature of Luna itself was never relevant to them?

No change is valid to you because you think I was trying to pull a fast one about Silkbinds.  I'd defend how the weapon is designed and the general incompetence of a lot of ""IG Mains"", and that would extend to you.  You're not engaging the game but the position you're defending is that ""Well Capcom doesn't know what they're doing"" because that is the logical extension of mopey IG takes.

Saying I did a false equivalent is like saying I tried to offer a Silkbind, no my criticism is way worse than that.

That kid is likely a sociopath, because first of all, a seven year old cannot lie well, they're too stupid and ignorant of the world, and give themselves away eventually or get obviously uncomfortable with serious grilling etc etc. Two, for a SEVEN YEAR OLD (that's grade 2, mind you), to come up with that, of course you'd believe it!!! Why wouldn't you? And of course your man would deny it (like if he's a piece of shit enough to cheat on you, then he's obviously gonna be a piece of shit enough to lie to you about it, so him denying it proves nothing). I honestly, honestly believe that this kid is a sociopath, to be able to not only pull that off, but go with it for so long with no remorse. Like, to not feel awful at how sad your mom's face must have looked when you told her, or all the nights your prob heard her crying, or all the fights you heard after you made up the lie, etc. That's just creepy. I once broke an old window in a barn at the back of our property when I was 6, and felt so guilty that by the end of day 2 I told my parents. I had a little kid I nannied come to me crying and she admitted that she made fun of me to her friends at school. Like, kids have disgusting amounts of empathy and compassion for others. Those that don't are the manipulative, generally sick-minded adults when they grow up.

Almost 8 years passed since Morris chirped about that without a word out of him since? 

&gt; (Dec 3, 2013): For those of you that liked [my] @Harpers article *Blood Spore*, I'm now expanding it into a book for @mcsweeneys
https://archive.is/jNxhw#selection-3021.0-3039.10 

Not like I'm the only one wondering. **What happened to Hamilton's book ""Blood Spore""...**  (OP) u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019) www.reddit.com/r/HamiltonMorris/comments/b8ywng/what_happened_to_hamiltons_book_blood_spore_from/  

&gt; Morris wrote an... article called ""Blood Spore"", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of ""mushroom doctor"" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/ [In] Podcast appearances ( ~4-5 years old) he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning [it] into a book, as documented by his tweet:
https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856
[ https://archive.is/jNxhw ] What happened to the book? Was Hamilton silenced... found out things he shouldn't?

&lt; Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City Univ of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI‚Ä¶ crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers‚Ä¶ 162 victims &gt;  http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

As Schlessinger said (in an episode of UP AND VANISHED):

&gt; most victims who get killed know the offender‚Ä¶ the vast majority of murders [involve] people closely connected‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim‚Ä¶ Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they‚Äôre smarter than law enforcement‚Ä¶  when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said ‚ÄúI know not, I‚Äôm not my brother‚Äôs keeper.‚Äù That‚Äôs the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who‚Äôs more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous [example], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. [Until] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader‚Äôs narcissism‚Ä¶ &gt; 

As in real life, so in 'true crime' fiction - it's a well worn storyline: 

&gt;  *The perp hires a detective* [or ""journalist""?] *to SoLvE tHe CrImE in order* **to throw suspicion off himself**... *strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it (same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police)... [it's] an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was* &gt; https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy

Amid a weird (let's not say 'suspicious') combination of sounds and silence, I could almost ponder, ‚ÄúIf I were a Hamilton Morris‚Äù (a harrowing premise):

Would I wanna be implicated in a homicide as accessory after the fact? By complicity with any unindicted suspect(s) availing of my story telling style (as a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù) to frame themselves innocent in a preemptive maneuver by diversionary scapegoating some Bad Cop - with me as mouthpiece?

Considering the Beug/Stamets partnership's record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Like the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;  *the student* [never mind his name btw] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended ‚ÄúThe Hollywood Bandit,‚Äù a notorious Western Bank Robber ‚Äì and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf  [Psst - &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound. The gunshot Sgt. Monta had heard was actually Scurlock shooting himself. &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Scurlock ]

Especially with nothing for an alibi but some hokey ‚Äòsmokey gun‚Äô audio cassette whose very authenticity Morris (according to his own unsworn testimony ""I, The Complicit"") can‚Äôt even account for, in his ‚Äòversion of events'?  On behalf of The Innocence Of Paul ""his fleece as white as snow"" (and just a crummy book deal in it for me)? 

As a frustrated Morris innocently explains:

&gt; I wanted to begin with a visit to Gary Davis‚Äôs house in Nixon (TX) to speak with him about the origin of the tape, BUT [nothin‚Äô doin'] he was *by his own admission* [decoded: alibi] preoccupied with having himself checked in to a mental institution ...

(Shades of Roswell mysteries. Like that &lt; mysterious envelope landed on ... Jaime Shandera‚Äôs doorstep, sent anonymously with no return address, postmarked Albuquerque, NM... [like] a huge hint to some that Richard Doty was behind this caper &gt; *Adam Gorightly Discusses 'Saucers, Spooks and Kooks'* by Jack Brewer, Feb 23, 2021)

Especially after the Big Dramatic intro Morris gives this whole 'smoking gun' audio cassette ('red herring' as known in cheap detective 'pulp fiction') in his Harper's fairy tale (absolving St Paul The Innocent):

&lt; July 2011, I received a fragile-looking Maxell compact cassette from a retired psychology professor and gerbil-aggression researcher named Gary Davis. 

&gt; I had been told... &gt; 

(By Stamets Who Apparently Found Out About (And Therefore Knew Of) This Tape - How Now Brown Cow - And In What Context Of His Telling Morris All About It, Praytell? Morris never does 'come clean' on these dirty details either...)

&lt; (that the tape) contained a recording of two police officers discussing their involvement in the robbery and murder of one Steven Pollock &gt; 

AND in acquiring the mystery tape from this ""Gary Davis"" it seems:

&gt; the transaction was further charged by a stern warning‚Ä¶ from Paul Stamets, who had told me about the tape but never actually heard it: ‚ÄúThis information should be treated with due caution. Some of these cops, if still living, could be very dangerous.‚Äù &gt;

Skipping past 'first things first' (how Morris first came to hear all about this tape from Stamets in the first place aka Where / When / Why) - Morris 'starts' from a different beginning of his story:

&gt; I first had the opportunity to question Stamets in person about the story of the tape. In a sold-out room with theatrically dimmed lights‚Ä¶ hesitant to bring up the subject of Pollock in public...

How discreet. And lo, when: 

&gt; I tell Stamets I have obtained the Pollock tape and think I can solve the murder, in response ‚Ä¶ his face changes. ‚ÄúYou know, Steve was assassinated by the police‚Äù &gt;

(Portions adapted/edited from www.reddit.com/r/Psychedelics_Society/comments/in45oc/suspected_cult_leader_and_enabler_of_child/ )

If I got myself caught up in a potentially incriminating felony web, by my fingerprints on some lame Harper's article (transparently contrived like whitewash) how might I disentangle myself, to get myself the hell out of criminal jeopardy as an accomplice? 

Hypothetically of course.

Considering the Beug/Stamets partnership's record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Like the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;  *the student* [never mind his name btw] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended ‚ÄúThe Hollywood Bandit,‚Äù a notorious Western Bank Robber ‚Äì and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf  [Psst - &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound.

As a frustrated Morris innocently explains:

&gt; I wanted to begin with a visit to Gary Davis‚Äôs house in Nixon (TX) to speak with him about the origin of the tape, BUT [nothin‚Äô doin'] he was *by his own admission* [decoded: alibi] preoccupied with having himself checked in to a mental institution ...

Especially after the Big Dramatic intro Morris gives this whole 'smoking gun' audio cassette ('red herring' as known in cheap detective 'pulp fiction') in his Harper's fairy tale (absolving St Paul The Innocent):

&lt; July 2011, I received a fragile-looking Maxell compact cassette from a retired psychology professor and gerbil-aggression researcher named Gary Davis. 

&gt; I had been told... &gt; 

(By Stamets Who Apparently Found Out About (And Therefore Knew Of) This Tape - How Now Brown Cow - And In What Context Of His Telling Morris All About It, Praytell? Morris never does 'come clean' on these dirty details either...)

&lt; (that the tape) contained a recording of two police officers discussing their involvement in the robbery and murder of one Steven Pollock &gt; 

AND in acquiring the mystery tape from this ""Gary Davis"" it seems:

&gt; the transaction was further charged by a stern warning‚Ä¶ from Paul Stamets, who had told me about the tape but never actually heard it: ‚ÄúThis information should be treated with due caution. Some of these cops, if still living, could be very dangerous.‚Äù &gt;

Skipping past 'first things first' (how Morris first came to hear all about this tape from Stamets in the first place aka Where / When / Why) - Morris 'starts' from a different beginning of his story:

&gt; I first had the opportunity to question Stamets in person about the story of the tape. In a sold-out room with theatrically dimmed lights‚Ä¶ hesitant to bring up the subject of Pollock in public...

How discreet. And lo, when: 

&gt; I tell Stamets I have obtained the Pollock tape and think I can solve the murder, in response ‚Ä¶ his face changes. ‚ÄúYou know, Steve was assassinated by the police‚Äù &gt;

If I got myself caught up in a potentially incriminating felony web, by my fingerprints on some lame Harper's article (transparently contrived like whitewash) how might I disentangle myself, to get myself the hell out of criminal jeopardy as an accomplice?

Almost 8 years passed since Morris chirped about that without a word out of him since? 

&gt; (Dec 3, 2013): For those of you that liked [my] @Harpers article *Blood Spore*, I'm now expanding it into a book for @mcsweeneys
https://archive.is/jNxhw#selection-3021.0-3039.10 

Not like I'm the only one wondering. **What happened to Hamilton's book ""Blood Spore""...**  (OP) u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019) www.reddit.com/r/HamiltonMorris/comments/b8ywng/what_happened_to_hamiltons_book_blood_spore_from/  

&gt; Morris wrote an... article called ""Blood Spore"", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of ""mushroom doctor"" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/ [In] Podcast appearances ( ~4-5 years old) he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning [it] into a book, as documented by his tweet:
https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856
[ https://archive.is/jNxhw ] What happened to the book? Was Hamilton silenced... found out things he shouldn't?

Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City Univ of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI‚Ä¶ crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers‚Ä¶ 162 victims &gt;  http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

As Schlessinger said (in an episode of UP AND VANISHED):

&gt; most victims who get killed know the offender‚Ä¶ the vast majority of murders [involve] people closely connected‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim‚Ä¶ Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they‚Äôre smarter than law enforcement‚Ä¶  when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said ‚ÄúI know not, I‚Äôm not my brother‚Äôs keeper.‚Äù That‚Äôs the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who‚Äôs more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous [example], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. [Until] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader‚Äôs narcissism‚Ä¶ &gt;

Almost 8 years passed since Morris chirped about that without a word out of him since? 

&gt; (Dec 3, 2013): For those of you that liked [my] @Harpers article *Blood Spore*, I'm now expanding it into a book for @mcsweeneys
https://archive.is/jNxhw#selection-3021.0-3039.10 

Not like I'm the only one wondering. **What happened to Hamilton's book ""Blood Spore""...**  (OP) u/mushroom_noob142 (Apr 3, 2019) www.reddit.com/r/HamiltonMorris/comments/b8ywng/what_happened_to_hamiltons_book_blood_spore_from/  

&gt; Morris wrote an... article called ""Blood Spore"", in which he discusses the mysterious murder of ""mushroom doctor"" Steven Pollock. You can read it here: https://harpers.org/archive/2013/07/blood-spore/ [In] Podcast appearances ( ~4-5 years old) he talked a lot about the fact that he was turning [it] into a book, as documented by his tweet:
https://twitter.com/hamiltonmorris/status/407993288063737856
[ https://archive.is/jNxhw ] What happened to the book? Was Hamilton silenced... found out things he shouldn't?

Dr John Schlessinger professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City Univ of New York) has studied the minds of killers for decades. He recently completed a major research study with the FBI‚Ä¶ crime-scene behaviors of 37 serial sexual murderers‚Ä¶ 162 victims &gt;  http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064970,00.html

As Schlessinger said (in an episode of UP AND VANISHED):

&gt; most victims who get killed know the offender‚Ä¶ the vast majority of murders [involve] people closely connected‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a lot of emotionality in the connection between offender and victim‚Ä¶ Many times, an individual thinks they can control the investigation. They think they‚Äôre smarter than law enforcement‚Ä¶  when the killer is confronted with wrongdoing, he lies. God asked Cain where is your brother Abel. And he said ‚ÄúI know not, I‚Äôm not my brother‚Äôs keeper.‚Äù That‚Äôs the prototype of the vast majority of murders. The mentally disordered offender, the psychotic(s)‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow the investigation. They live in their own world. But somebody who‚Äôs more intact, more intelligent, very often does... Sometimes they inject themselves into the investigation, which often leads to their apprehension. The famous [example], Dennis Rader the BTK killer. The case was cold for 30 years. [Until] a citizen in Kansas wrote a book on the BTK killer. And that triggered Dennis Rader‚Äôs narcissism‚Ä¶ &gt; 

As in real life so in 'true crime' fiction - it's a well worn storyline: 

&gt;  *The perp hires a detective* [or ""journalist""?] *to SoLvE tHe CrImE in order* **to throw suspicion off himself**... *strengthen their claim they're innocent and ignorant of it (same logic that sometimes leads criminals to report their own crimes to the police)... [is] an archetypal trope in detective fiction, as even Sherlock Holmes was* &gt; https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectivePatsy

Amid a weird (let's not say 'suspicious') combination of sounds and silence, I could almost ponder, ‚ÄúIf I were a Hamilton Morris‚Äù (a harrowing premise):

Would I wanna be implicated in a homicide as accessory after the fact? By complicity with any unindicted suspect(s) availing of my story telling style (as a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù) to frame themselves innocent in a preemptive maneuver by diversionary scapegoating some Bad Cop - with me as mouthpiece?

Considering the Beug/Stamets partnership's record of smearing cops as villains in just such diversion tactics even in a case where the facts to the contrary are matters of record (not Unsolved Mysteries). Like the tragic fate of former Beug/Stamets friend poor Scott Scurlock:

&gt;  *the student* [never mind his name btw] *was killed by police* ... we found that my wife and I (he was also one of her students) had befriended ‚ÄúThe Hollywood Bandit,‚Äù a notorious Western Bank Robber ‚Äì and a modern Robin Hood &gt; page 39 https://web.archive.org/web/20160913172743/http://www.fungimag.com/summer-2011-articles/FungiSUM_HistoryFutureLR.pdf  [Psst - &lt; Police ... found Scurlock dead from a self-inflicted gun wound. The gunshot Sgt. Monta had heard was actually Scurlock shooting himself. &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Scurlock ]

Especially with nothing for an alibi but some hokey ‚Äòsmokey gun‚Äô audio cassette whose very authenticity Morris (according to his own unsworn testimony ""I, The Complicit"") can‚Äôt even account for, in his ‚Äòversion of events'?  On behalf of The Innocence Of Paul ""his fleece as white as snow"" (and just a crummy book deal in it for me)? 

As a frustrated Morris innocently explains:

&gt; I wanted to begin with a visit to Gary Davis‚Äôs house in Nixon (TX) to speak with him about the origin of the tape, BUT [nothin‚Äô doin'] he was *by his own admission* [decoded: alibi] preoccupied with having himself checked in to a mental institution ...

(Shades of Roswell mysteries. Like that &lt; mysterious envelope landed on ... Jaime Shandera‚Äôs doorstep, sent anonymously with no return address, postmarked Albuquerque, NM... [like] a huge hint to some that Richard Doty was behind this caper &gt; *Adam Gorightly Discusses 'Saucers, Spooks and Kooks'* by Jack Brewer, Feb 23, 2021)

Especially after the Big Dramatic intro Morris gives this whole 'smoking gun' audio cassette ('red herring' as known in cheap detective 'pulp fiction') in his Harper's fairy tale (absolving St Paul The Innocent):

&lt; July 2011, I received a fragile-looking Maxell compact cassette from a retired psychology professor and gerbil-aggression researcher named Gary Davis. 

&gt; I had been told... &gt; 

(By Stamets Who Apparently Found Out About (And Therefore Knew Of) This Tape - How Now Brown Cow - And In What Context Of His Telling Morris All About It, Praytell? Morris never does 'come clean' on these dirty details either...)

&lt; (that the tape) contained a recording of two police officers discussing their involvement in the robbery and murder of one Steven Pollock &gt; 

AND in acquiring the mystery tape from this ""Gary Davis"" it seems:

&gt; the transaction was further charged by a stern warning‚Ä¶ from Paul Stamets, who had told me about the tape but never actually heard it: ‚ÄúThis information should be treated with due caution. Some of these cops, if still living, could be very dangerous.‚Äù &gt;

Skipping past 'first things first' (how Morris first came to hear all about this tape from Stamets in the first place aka Where / When / Why) - Morris 'starts' from a different beginning of his story:

&gt; I first had the opportunity to question Stamets in person about the story of the tape. In a sold-out room with theatrically dimmed lights‚Ä¶ hesitant to bring up the subject of Pollock in public...

How discreet. And lo, when: 

&gt; I tell Stamets I have obtained the Pollock tape and think I can solve the murder, in response ‚Ä¶ his face changes. ‚ÄúYou know, Steve was assassinated by the police‚Äù &gt;

(Portions adapted/edited from www.reddit.com/r/Psychedelics_Society/comments/in45oc/suspected_cult_leader_and_enabler_of_child/ )

If I got myself caught up in a potentially incriminating felony web, by my fingerprints on some lame Harper's article (transparently contrived like whitewash) how might I disentangle myself, to get myself the hell out of criminal jeopardy as an accomplice? 

Hypothetically of course.
****
****
So lemme get this straight.  

With such inneresting questions overhanging his pencil-thick neck like a sword of Damocles, all Morris chatters away about (""for about two hours""!) in this 'really interesting podcast"" is: 

&gt;  DMT vs. 5-MeO-DMT, ayahuasca vs. ""pharmahuasca"" and how Hamilton likes to take oral DMT, as well as Hamilton's favorite moments from his show and the struggles making it

"gq3n6tl","Yes, it's okay to be who you are. God didn't make bugs he made features. What steps you'll take as you walk with God are ultimately between you and God. 

Some people will try to tell you what God means for you. If you listen to them, they might destroy you even if they are trying to help answer your questions. The Bible warns us of this. Like any writing, the Bible can be misunderstood, indeed some authors can be twisted very easily. Scripture admits this (see 2 Peter 3:16). This presents situations where believers will disagree about a 'rule'. Romans 14 implies even the Apostles left many things mysterious and disputable... which means Christ likely did too, where one believer might decide one way and another might decide another way as far as their obedience to God. God leaves some things to individuals' consciences with the holy Spirit, for a good reason. It is an opportunity for us to apply Christ's dogma to our own lives to experience God personally. Subjectively. Through the holy Spirit. Not objectively from a rule in a book or a preachers mouth. It is the opportunity to become one with God in our heart instead of just thinking we are one with God in our own mind because someone told us the implied meaning of some line of code in a book of rules.

Everything God created is good *when received with prayer and thanksgiving.* The choice of whether, when, how to receive anything God made is our's alone ultimately. My Bible and many others' doesn't say homosexuality is evil unless I cherry pick a translation.  So it is a disputable issue. 

The Bible has a specific treatment for issues that are perhaps implied in one passage, read one way, but not said explicitly, or for issues where one translation says one thing and another says something different. *‚ÄúAs for the man who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not for disputes over opinions... Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Master is able to make him stand. One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike. Let every one be fully convinced in his own mind...‚Äù - Romans 14*

There are those who claim this is not disputable issue, and say that you would ""clearly"" be sinning, ""clearly"" unnatural, ""clearly"" vile if you practiced your sexuality ever, even in a context with self-control, faithfulness, gentleness, patience, joy, and love. They would come to this judgement and control the rest of your life based on their ability to rip one verse out of context if you would let them. The people who argue this way typically rely on 1 passage by the Apostle Paul, ripped out of context in Romans 1, the Apostle Paul... the author that the Bible says is easy to misunderstand and destroy ourselves with (*2 Peter 3:16*).

If only the reader will read the whole chapter of Romans 1, in context, we can see Paul condemns homosexuality ""because of"" idolatry as unnatural and vile. Those who can't obey God and mind their own business ignore the context to assume their conclusion. Back then, in Paul's day, the temple prostitutes Paul was writing about would be like like if J.D. Greear, though a straight man, dressed up in drag and convinced people to pay him for pleasure and blessings from a god... knowing full well that God is God.

Yes, their affections were vile. If all of us can just assume our conclusions irrationally like the pharisaical dogmatist, then anyone can take a microscope to the chapter and say that 1/8th of a passage necessarily means all affections are necessarily and certainly, clearly vile. It would be dumb and ignorant of me to ignore the context of the rest of the Bible and interpret this one phrase ""vile affections"" to mean all affection is vile though.

I'm not gay so I can't share your struggle, I'm sorry, though I cannot in good conscience ignore the context of the rest of Romans 1 and interpret one line (where people of the same sex had vile affections) and then just assume the conclusion that all same sex affection is vile because my daddy in the pulpit with fire in his eyes told me so. I'm not calling anyone who does read Paul differently dumb nor ignorant; I'm the dumbest and most ignorant person I know. This is merely my POV while I read the passage... and it is obvious from just a common sense reading of the passage, if only read in context, in the entirety of the chapter, that it isn't certainly explicit that it means attractions are vile nor that homosexuality itself is 'clearly' vile. A reader merely needs to open both eyes and read the context.

Wherever God leads you, keep your head up. You don't necessarily have any less of the holy Spirit than anyone else in the entire world. God made you well. Don't listen to the people that pretend to know what the most disputable passages in the Bible mean. The holy Spirit is a higher authority than a translation of a copy of a translation of a copy that differs from someone elses'. The reason those passages they tell you to read are disputable is because they've always been disputable (not all the passages... just coincidentally the ones they shame you with of course). Rabbis argued and debated this nonsensical busybodiness thousands of years ago too, about the precise meaning of this or that world thousands of years older than them, and everything else having to do with anything anyone would trust them on back then too. They'd tell you to read more scripture also, same type of person. Nothing has changed... except Christ defeated death, rose, fulfilled the law, and gave his holy Spirit to us. So I say pray. ""Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of truth, present everywhere, who fills all things, treasury of good things, come and dwell in us and cleanse us from all our impurities, and cleanse me first.""

Many in the West look at themselves as already justified and at everyone else in the world as those who are not justified yet. They see as unjust every other person that doesn't believe exactly as they do about Jesus, hell, people who live with their significant other, gay people, interracial couples, people who have sex during pregnancy, and whatever other rules the ""Christian"" version of the Pharisee makes up for everyone else. They are sorely mistaken, and one day they will reap what they've sown. The true path toward justification is quite the opposite of their approach. The true path to justification is to assume our mistakes to be the main problem, not the sins of the 'other.' *See the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector in Luke 18:9-14*. The true path to justification is to treat ourselves as the 'other,' not because we believe the people who call themselves the righteous ones and call us sinners, not because we think they have any sense at all nor are speaking truthfully, but rather because the moment we think we are good enough, that's as good as we will ever become. And we may have to be better yet. 

Some might treat you like the ""other,"" like the ""sinner,"" on account of your personal decisions about your body with your girl. The true path to justification is to treat ourselves as the 'other,' not because we believe the people who call themselves the righteous ones and call us sinners, not because we think they have any sense at all nor are speaking truthfully, but rather because the moment we think we are good enough, that's as good as we will ever become. And we may have to be better yet. We certainly have to be better than those who twist disputable passages to accuse us. 

The Bible says those who would condemn the innocent are an abomination before God. They'd even accuse God and did. If they can't shame you because you've adjusted all your behaviors to match their rules, then they will start trying to convince you to shame someone else. Shame is a hell of a motivator. Shame can fill pews and then fill the people in those pews with pride (as they shame others) and eventually fill a pocket of a pastor willing to play politics with other peoples disputable issues. It has always been this way. These people hated Jesus too. 

If you could go back in time and talk to the ""Christians"" 50 years ago that convinced themselves with twists on ancient Pauline passages that interracial marriage is a sin, and if you tried to explain to them that they were just twisting the meaning of ancient Pauline passages from the Bible into weapons of shame and self-righteousness, then you'd know how it feels to try to explain to a pharisaical theist in similar churches today that the historical context of Romans 1 (and even the immediate context) doesn't necessarily mean being in a self-controlled, faithful, kind, gentle, patient, peaceful, joyful, loving gay relationship is necessarily evil, and 1 Corinthians 6:9 is mistranslated in many Bibles that were translated for and then marketed to their grandparents. 

The Word of God walked among us and said the only command that is like ‚Äúlove God,‚Äù and that all commands also hang on, is ""Love your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù That is the dogma, the interpretation so to speak, that Christ has said all the law falls under.",1615128739,"it would be dumb and ignorant of me to ignore the context of the rest of the bible and interpret this one phrase ""vile affections"" to mean all affection is vile though.","dumb and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"dumb and ignorant","dumb",NA,NA,0

"gppibft","It just show how ignorant you are and how hard it is for sexual assaults to make it through court. Look at Brock the Rapist Turner, who raped a woman who was unconscious and was even fought off by a third party witness. He got 6 months. You're telling me, even with that woman being blamed by Brock the Rapist Turner and his family (starring Father of the Year: ""His life is over for his 15 minutes of action""), and being dragged through the courts somehow... it would be easier for Seth as a black man? David outright stated they targeted Seth because he was black, while implying it would then be easier to silence him on it because of the stigma it would bring in his personal circle. 

You seem wildly apathetic and ignorant of how sexual assault impacts people and the just gross attitude of law enforcement and courts would treat this.

1: There is a significant gap between between laws and today's modern/online stream. Revenge porn laws are still not able to keep up, but David is still profiting off Seth's pain... and you still want to somehow blame the victims still. 

Most importantly:

**2: David can't apologize, legally, cause it can seen as he is admitting guilt**. ESPECIALLY as a Dreamer, as he could face immediate deportation if linked to a sexual crime in the US. His legal team is probably telling him to ignore it, not to do any apology, and allow his supporters to go after the victims. I mean, you're literally doing his lawyer's job for free here in the subreddit. It's very by the book DARVO tactics. Your romance partner should be wary.

3: It takes a lot for a man to stand up and say he was sexual assaulted. David goes into great details admitting his crime, but both sides have spun it. This is common for victims to try to rationalize what has happened to them to cope. People can link old interviews, but again: It's hard to be honest on what's going on in one's life when our society loves to victim blame. Especially men who are abused or sexually exploited. Terry Crews has spoken about it and we are still trying to justify disgusting behavior by famous pedophiles. 

4: Going to court takes time and money, also COVID has delayed a lot of legal proceedings in court right now. This is also related to number 1, but hopefully they do consult a lawyer.

The rebellion was initially a non-extremist grassroots movement with mass army defections but was later hijacked by jihadis. It's common knowledge that the majority Syrian Sunni population felt disenfranchised by Assad's policies, which resulted in a grassroots uprising with mass defections from the military.

&gt; Who could have ever seen this coming 

Hindsight is 20/20. 

&gt; Yes and Osama bin Laden was a freedom fighter 

False equivalency. OBL is a salafi jihadi. Distinctions are your friend.

&gt; Where did I say I don't blame  the Syrian regime? They emptied their prisons full of jihadists 

Fair point. 

&gt; Saudi Arabia and Qatar would not do anything significant without the  (even tacit) consent of the US. 

They've done *many* things without tacit consent of the US. Spreading Wabahism/Salafism has been their modus operandi for 30+ years. Do you think the US gave tacit consent on this policy??

&gt;Also, where do SA and Qatar get their  weapons from? Ah the US ? 

The US is the #1 global arms exporter...what about it?

&gt; I'm sure the CIA never envisioned the possibility of such weapons  falling in the hands of extremists, the CIA would never arm or support  extremist groups fighting against their enemy.  

Again, hindsight is 20/20. It was clearly a situation which spiraled out of control very quickly and the program was mothballed when it became apparent that the jihadis were overruning the moderate, grassroots uprising. Also consider the fact that the US at least had the decency to mop up the ISIS mess it indirectly helped to create.

&gt; How can you possibly be so naive and ignorant of the past (and present)? 

No need to make this personal - I'm not in charge of US foreign policy. Just trying to add some perspective to The SCW, which many people on this sub lack. It is so often chalked up to a misleading and oversimplistic narrative where the US intentionally armed bloodthirsty jihadis in an attempt to dethrone the benevolent Assad regime.

Yes and Osama bin Laden was a freedom fighter

&gt;If we're going to use this logic as an argument for the US arming jihadis, then we must also blame the Syrian regime and its backers whose battlefield arms were taken over by these same jihadis

Where did I say I don't blame  the Syrian regime? They emptied their prisons full of jihadists 

&gt;And let's not forget that Saudi Arabia and Qatar continued to arm the opposition well after the emergence of ISIS.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar would not do anything significant without the (even tacit) consent of the US. Also, where do SA and Qatar get their weapons from? Ah the US ?

&gt;So there is certainly a distinction here between direct intent to arm extremist jihadis and arms indirectly falling into their possession.

"gom6yvc","This is a massively privileged and uninformed take on the issue.

The issue at hand is not girl spaces or boy spaces.  The issue is that the GS is in no way equivalent to the BSA, and their is no way to make it so.  

The BSA is bigger, older, better funded, wider reaching, more prestigious (at least in part because of historic sexism) has many more/bigger/better camps and is part of a worldwide organization (which is already mostly coed and has been for years). The GS is none of those things, and acting like they can just ""fix it"" is totally ignorant of the reality. 

 It has literally taken a century and a worldwide movement to make scouting what it is, even if the GS wanted to achieve the same thing (they don't, they have different goals) and if they had a plan to make it so (again, they don't) it would take at minimum 50 years to achieve something even remotely comparable.  Meanwhile millions of young women (like my daughter)  would miss out on life-changing opportunities that you and I were privileged to enjoy because of something we had no control over.  

I'm sorry that the idea of women having the same opportunities you did makes you sad and uncomfortable, but that's life.  The truth is that the presence of women would not have diminished the value of the male role models you had in scouting.  You're going to encounter women in every part of your life for as long as you live (they are, in fact, half of all people you will meet)  and trying to prepare a young man for leadership while actively excluding women is doing him a massive disservice.  The exclusion is harmful to BOTH sexes.

*USTR is now too difficult*

The solution to USTR wasn‚Äôt to just make it extremely hard for the playerbase as well as nerfing all rewards, literally no one asked for this.

"go5fmco","Well I still do think that procreation is a selfish act because you were fulfilling your own desire when trying to bring about a new sentient being. I don't think the selfishness argument is good, but I don't think all the premises are wrong. The sentient being themselves never desired to be born prior, because they didn't exist. In your second paragraph, I think this is often a critique of consequentialism and utilitarianism in particular which seems to be a bit misguided. Consequentialists care about the expected consequences, not the actual ones. The expected consequence of giving a suprise present such as a dog isn't that they'd bite the owner, and so we'd multiply the probability of the event with the amount of utility lost, and now much less utility has been subtracted. This is under classical utilitarianism anyway. My view isn't exactly the same, but I think it can still account for situations like these. Another thing is that the person who gave the gift would be at fault for not taking the necessary precautions. Also, if the person keeps on giving these dangerous gifts despite them having good intentions, we would ask them to stop giving gifts and hold them at fault despite them not intending for any of the bad things to happen.

Another thing to take into account is that if someone procreates with good intentions in bad circumstances such as in personal economic trouble, we hold those people accountable despite them having good intentions. Why? Because they were negligent and ignorant of the expected consequences. So at what point is the chance for a positive outcome high enough and at what point is it low enough? It seems somewhat arbitrary. For the button thought experiment, could I press it when there's a 49% chance of it failing? 40%? 35%? I think extreme suffering is also a tad bit higher than the five percent in the original thought experiment.

We should hold people accountable, and while we can blame people for intent, it's not that the intent is inherently bad, it's because people with bad intentions can cause more suffering.",1613850605,"because they were negligent and ignorant of the expected consequences.","negligent and ignorant","ignorant","and",FALSE,"negligent and ignorant","negligent",NA,NA,0

"gnzyp1a","One, blaming ethnic cleansings on the ""capitalist status quo"" is a major cap in it itself. I'm guessing the Khmer Rouge was part of that hmm?

I'm not quite sure which ethnic cleansings or mass murders you refer to but by my recollection of history, it was probably in Africa or within the Vietnam War? I would agree that Vietnam should've never happened, at least not to the extent it actually did. Frankly, the US should've compelled the Southern Vietnamese to actually hold democratic elections and take care of their people in exchange for support and maybe it wouldn't have gotten so messy. As for Truman Doctrine, are you going to claim its application, especially in areas such as Korea, was not justified? Or was the unprovoked attack by the DPRK reasonable under the circumstances.

Domino theory was the only way to contain communism. I wish it also came with the stipulation that the countries that were being protected had to hold free and fair elections, but it appears the US didn't have the balls, or the political power, for that reality. 

Regardless, painting the Soviets as some sort of victim in this endeavor is laughable and ignorant of history. The Soviets were politically dominating the Eastern side of Europe. They also provoked conflict on a similar scale as the US and their NATO allies. They attempted to force the hand of the allies at every turn. The Berlin Airlift, the Korean War (by proxy), the Chinese Civil war (By Proxy again), and all throughout Southeast Asia. This game was mutual. The announcement of the Truman Doctrine wasn't the kickoff for the Cold War and saying so paints the entire thing squarely as a fault of the West. 

Stalin was a brutal man and an even more brutal politician. Truman Doctrine was only declared as a result of the Soviet's strengthening position throughout the world. The West used containment and economic means to ensure that a tragedy the size of the Second World War never befell the world again.

To visualize just how many lives Truman Doctrine, the West's form of combatting communism through economic and (mostly, I don't know every conflict and I'm sure some idiot started some at some point) means, here is a video that drastically helps visualize the whole thing:

https://youtu.be/DwKPFT-RioU

Take note of the large body count within the 50's and remember the Chinese civil war was still taking place. The spike in interstate conflicts spikes during the Vietnam war. Yet still, it pales in comparison to the death tole found within World War 2. Had the world been plunged into a operation unthinkable situation, the casualties would have been most likely higher than even that.

Are you his accountant?

Most public entertainers don't regularly do things for their audience for free - let alone do things for free that cost THEMSELVES money - and it's even less likely that such a person would suddenly decide to do so after getting multiple sponsorships, partnerships, Youtube monetization, products to advertise, merch sales, and hundreds of thousands of free dollars from his fans. Yes, we're all speculating what kind of money James might happen to make, but it's ludicrous and ignorant of the available evidence to suggest that he's somehow financially struggling. The man didn't even pay for his kid's surgery, the low-income assistance Shriners' hospital did - even after he'd made a movie, bought a new house, still had his monetized channel, and apparently already made his deal with Screenwave.

You can still enjoy James and his content and want to root for him. That's fine, it's your right and no one can make you stop. That's your own decision. You can also wish that people didn't mock James, or that we were less ""delusional"" (an ironic statement) and more ""civilized"". That's your prerogative. But the fact is, a lot of people don't like James and are deeply disappointed with him - the more they learn, they more disappointed with him they become. That's what happens when people are let down by the negative and / or questionable behavior of someone they used to like, someone whose entire lifestyle they helped to pay for.

Or make your own posts asking legitimate questions about why they dislike James or why you feel they prevent you from having more civilized discussions. I don't really know why you're here if you think that the negativity towards James is unfounded, but not everyone here hates him like you seem to think we do.

... You twisted my words like your mom twisted on your neighbor dick. No comments...


&gt;Liberalization is a catastrophe for those suffering under it as their services are privatized for pennies and become unavailable for large swaths of people that are then left to suffer. As I already mentioned, this happened repeatedly in Warsaw Pact countries after color revolutions, not just when the USSR dissolved.

It takes at least decades for a few economic numbers to recover, though these still do not include basic information like access and price of housing, healthcare, homelessness, etc.



This is fault of governments of countries in which ""LibIlArIzatIoan"" took part. his is a mistake of the authorities of those countries where liberalization took place.  Well, yes, you can't put water in a pan with holes.  Conditions absolutely not suitable.  And fuck liberalization is not war

The aforementioned US civil war is another where Christians fought and died to end slavery. Where yes a majority of Christians were literally giving up their lives so that slavery would end. The entire economic and technological power of the north was used to end slavery. Lincoln was a Christian and used every tactic he could to end slavery.

Here's a religious song specifically written to advocate for the noble cause of giving up your life to end slavery. And the most popular song of the civil war.

&gt;There's quite a big change when a character becomes a suffering marshal, or a magistrate (more so if it's the adept kind), or a mortigue.

Not really.

The characters generally aren't entirely stupid and ignorant of what their jobs involve, and the main IC difference is external expectations on their duties while working. Characters do usually ply a regular job of some capacity in DH1e. It's not all inquisitorial stipends.

Mortiurges are assigned to the role, or they're recognised killers. Either way, the change is that they shift focus from law enforcement to on-site execution.

Suffering Marshals' most common means of entry is through the Inquisition. Promotion is temporary, a target is assigned, and their worth is measured in how well they capture said target.

Magistrates ... 'Requirements: Literacy Skill and either Common Lore: Administratum or Scholastic Lore: Judgement'. You had to start learning for this somehow. Books, tutors, other magistrates. Whatever it was, good enough; you're a magistrate now.

&gt;The latter makes it feel like you lose something.

You don't actually need the game mechanics to observe precisely when the character is informed of their promotion in lockstep chronological order. Just have things happen before the next rank.

Even so, there's nothing wrong with suggesting characters learn a little from the CRB entry for taking elite advances before they enter anything non-standard - justify why it makes sense, explain what you've been doing to support it, and haggle details until a compromise is reached.

Also given that there are a few songs on the album about predatory/abusive male relationship behaviors, which is very socially prominent currently.

He gets more excited but not too angrily when first confrotned during, ""Am I gonna to get up? Am I gonna get up? No never!"" And the first chorus is stern but not overly aggressive, and ""lazy in the evening boy"" comes off as if he believes he's just the ""work hard, rest hard"" type. It continues to build in intensity and noise, and jumps straight to the second bridge which ends aggressively with, ""Never! Never! Never!"" as the instruments fade off. The second chorus is heavier with bass and Alex sings more adamantly.

"gmzfqn0","First off, I strongly disagree with the author of the article.As mentioned, there is the option of using LNG Terminals but possible suppliers of LNG gas aren't many and of those, most have a rather questionable human rights record as well (don't get me wrong, I do believe that russia could do way better in terms of human rights :))

By amount exported:

1. Qatar: ...
2. Australia: transporting gas around the world in heavy crude oil spilling vessels doesn't sound green to me (+ Australia tends to be on the denying side of climate change)
3. USA: fraking gas and sending it over the ocean, an option, but far from green and ignorant of the longterm destruction on nature
4. Russia: ...

In the end, Norway is the main European supplier but can't handle the needs of all of Europe.I just do not think there would be any sense in stopping such a project at this point in time. If you want to put pressure on russia, build the pipeline and don't buy gas, but stopping a nearly completed pipeline because of daily changing political alliances does not seem practical at all (and we germans favour practicality ;)).

Looking at the ""Energiewende"", I do hope that we might be able to proceed faster than expected and are able to stop using gas as soon as possible, but after an interesting discussion with an electrical engineer friend of mine, I think this will take some time and we will need an reliable partner with gas. Russia kept there promises concerning gas and the only times they didn't were because of a bunch of corrupt Ukrainians, who stole more than expected and that's more of a pro for NS2.

To conclude: I do hope for a democratic change in russia (partly because a democracy needs new leaders every now and than, but who am I as a German to judge, Mutti Merkel...)  hopefully done by more pro European people but that's their intern affairs. As a trade partner and reliable gas supplier, russia is and will be essential in the near future and I personally think of it rather as a chance for us, to share our culture und worldview with them to assist the democratic process, than a threat. They need buyers and we need suppliers, the promise of the European Union is peace through trade... we should try to keep it.

Most victims of rape are male? Though I acknowledge rape of males likely is vastly under reported it is not the case that males are disproportionate victims of rape. That is not [true.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender) Why would you even bring up something so easily disproven? Even the whole notion of bringing rape into the discourse is nonsensical.

I am all for shutting down the economy, when necessary, during a pandemic. Damn right I am which any reasonable person would be when arguing from an informed position. A position which also includes compensation for workers and owners of the means of production when society, aka the state, forcefully dictate hibernation of private business'. Simple common sense.

I feel for you if you think the absence of consent makes rape and shutdowns comparable to any great length. If any. Through such a position any situation directly involving any enforcement of a law, rule or regulation you do not explicitly consent to as infringement on your opinions, positions and on occasion rights. You are essentially arguing a zero position of the Hobbesian state of nature.

Further it can be argued you hold the position, by inference, that any aspect of the social contract derived before your age of competence, typically at the age of eighteen, is enforced upon you as you had no say, typically elections, in its introduction and implementation. That would of course include vast tranches of law up to and including the Constitution. The position in the above two paragraphs are unrealistically untenable in good old reality.

 To argue for government shutdown within the non-aggression principle since you see consent as a pillar of inter-people and people to societal interaction is not all that challenging. 

Business' directly or indirectly place workers on the one hand in a credible risk to life and liberty when they have to work in a pandemic. If the state does not provide economic relief it is easy to argue and imagine that there are workers, owners of means of production as well, at their place of work under duress. Reality forces you to the table and walking away is not a credible option.

Similar arguments would be easy to make when leaving the abomination that people are rational actors. Humans are not consistent rational beings and thus can willfully or ignorantly, directly and indirectly, place others in harm. In other words they break the NAP and an impartial mechanism, or set of mechanisms, such as a law becomes a necessity. This argument is again simple to make for rational implementations of policy on the issue of shutdowns during extraordinary times of a pandemic.

It would be easy to find examples of both wilful and ignorant, of their covid-19 status, individuals getting themselves in situations where they either cause harm or is s serious risk of causing a third party harm. How do you as a business owner negate that credible threat to your charges, workers, customers and other third parties present on premises, and ensure a risk averse environment? You cannot self regulate, even if we assumed you act rationally as a risk averse, in the cause no harm sense, actor as you credibly cannot address the imperfect information position you hold.

You put words in my mouth. Where have I made the claim nobody is able or entitied, to the extent that is possible, to hatred? I have not at all made such claims. You made the claim so find the proof in my posts; you cannot because it is not there. I made the justified claim too many use strong words such as hate when other less strong words such as dislike etc. likely reflect their view better. That is a second count of misrepresentation.

Bootlicker? I have made no claims to being libertarian, never have never will for obvious political philosophical reasons, so stop making shit up. You look the fool; consistently so if I may add. That was the third misrepresentation.

The fourth is that you are incapable of understanding the role of a quote. It is a good but harsh comment on the role of the individual in a polity's plight. Your business is unfortunate for you, workers etc. but for society it is an insignificant statistic; one among the many. Harsh but no less true.

To bring up Stalin as if invoking the only thing people are likely to be able to quote him for makes one a Stalinist/Communist would be hilarious if it was not so sad.

"gmudwec","Subaru is a character with very obvious flaws and weaknesses. A trait that makes characters actually believable and realistic. Rather than just having a character that is either extremely overpowered, extremely smart, supremely gifted, etc. Subaru has absolutely nothing, aside from a curse that can or cannot be considered good for him. He didn't change at all when making the transition from his world to Luginica. All it really did was make him excited because like you said, he had given up on his world. His personality was the exact same as before and that was made very clear. The only difference was that he was naive and ignorant of his situation.

And in regards to his character growth. There is hardly a better progression anywhere than with Subaru. It's slow and realistic, he starts out weak and unknowing. Selfish, needy, and clings to ideologies that test his very being. The problems he faces in his series are all tests of virtues. The first testing Pride vs Humility, where he goes with the latter and gets help from others (Reinhard) to solve his problem. A latter being Wrath vs Patience. He chooses to kill himself by backflipping of a cliff, because he wants to figure out what went wrong and how to save his friends. When he was completely in the right, innocent, and should of run away.

He constantly overcomes these situations, and steadily progresses into a person actually worth respect. His desires are replaced with purpose, his skills are honed and he obtains new abilities. He learns from his mistakes and doesn't just waste his lives like he used to. People that went from absolutely hating him before, admire him because of his accomplishments and actions.

Basically, he is a breath of fresh air for an isekai protagonist. At least if you don't mind the cringe along the way. It's like watching your child grow up into an adult basically.

But I do know what I am talking about. Reality. 

You are talking about your perception of ideal government/society. Taxes, no matter what they go to, are a theft on the working class. The fact that taxes dont go to their designated ""cause"" further illustrates the fallibility of ever increasing government intervention. 

People are barely responsible with their own finances (see your large loan debt). How responsible do you think your neighbor will be with YOUR money??? What about me? Do you think I'll care if YOU go bankrupt because I spend your money? This IS our current tax situation. Legislating our grandchildren into unpayable debt because [insert altruistic cause here]... 

But judging by your claims of ""dumping all our money into the military"", I can guess you dont really understand how the federal government budgets and allocates funding or what the bulk of that funding goes to (tricare, infrastructure, training, food, energy, emergancy management capabilities etc as opposed to weapons and ammunition). 

Yes, the elite have advantages in this crony-corporate world... but guess who empowers them??? That's right, big government that would need to be much much bigger (with a bigger army) to implement and enforce the ""humanitarian"" socialist nation many claim as ""supeior"" to capitalism or their misrepresentations thereof.

"glvmd62","&gt;Many of these decentralized nations were not rich or sophisticated relative to those colonizing at all. Those with no contact to empires of Europe or Asia had no basis for an economy other than local bartering. Nothing near the level of the state-sponsored merchants of Europe.

The way Europe did things is not the definition of sophistication or complexity. Do some reading of actual history and archaeology of the Americas, not just trashy pop history Guns and Steel nonsense.

&gt;And why I argue about their innocence is because it portrays them as the victim; that purportedly such civilized societies were conquered and exploited, and ultimately ruined. Often that view is not so accurate given modern developments in these regions.

And here we have it, blatant colonialist apologia

Yes, actually, these societies were conquered and exploited and ruined. Not right from the get go! In North America especially there was a long period of mutually beneficial trade for some time.

"gloi2b0","I would say with the US, it might in part be tactical. Film and television, American made games, all soft power. I was talking about this with my Filipino friend, he notices it a lot more over there. Ireland I am really concerned about, because growing up we had very few actual Irish shows, other than the amazingly Irish Morbegs. Do you know of the Morbegs? Show it to Americans you often get ""Wtf."" Television, film, books and video games are amazing ways to influence young minds, and I wouldn't put it past the US to have an agenda. I know with the UK, it's mostly just a proximity thing, Ireland gets a lot of the channels from there, and because we are right here, Sky obviously sees us as a viable market for their Internet and digital television. Sometimes though I think something happened after the pro-treaty side of the Irish Civil War were backed by the UK, and won with British help. I know the tiny island of Singapore got the ""will never make it alone"" gaslighting, they somehow did much better than Ireland, got help developing their own independent military too. 

I don't always say what I really think at risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist and idiots either call me a Communist or a Fascist without knowing what these things mean, but I do know Ireland is close bosom buddies with the British intelligence services, while Ireland has been criticised as lacking with our own, that's like counter terrorism stuff and espionage in other countries. We are always lacking. Always. Military laughed at as a joke, even here, people convinced to be anti-military and ignorant of our own Defence Forces, very little opportunity to join even the Reserves. Even our achievements like making amazing chocolate and animation made here(Song of the Sea) seem to be hidden gems. 

I don't know for sure what the cause of all the lacking, buried achievements and the plan for Varadkar and his ilk to celebrate the black&amp;tans British state terrorist forces in Ireland is all about. I don't know why Irish Republican dissidents are shamed for even breathing, while British loyalists here tend to avoid media attention. But something is off in Ireland, something is rotten. I don't think we are as independent as we claim. Psyops and other things must have been used to warp my people from the start because Britain didn't want a strong country right next to them...I mean it's plausible. We have often been attacked based on our being right there, right there next to Britain, a potential security risk. I mean, if I were leading a country and I saw opportunities to keep a neighbour with a history of rebellions and bad relations weaker, I would, so why wouldn't the people behind the curtain in Britain do the same to Ireland? If I were leading Ireland, and we previously dominated Britain, I would want measures taken to sabotage the development of Britain as an independent state, would bribe or blackmail politicians there to make all the wrong decisions knowing that humans are weak, and I would even be ""nice"" enough to defend our common airspace and downplay the need for them to develop their own proper airforce. Idk. Maybe I'm reading too much into things and Britain has never seriously infiltrated Irish politics, life, national psyche. Did you know British forces helped the pro-treaty forces destroy the anti-treaty forces though?

 A Canadian Scot once mocked Ireland as having buckled, but that was in reference to the end of the Provos campaign, and of course our Irish brand mediocrity and smol identity is mocked, openly, maliciously. That's both because people worship strength, and because they know on some level that Ireland was played. I am not an IRA member, mostly because I think their tactics won't work right now and I know long term the war is one of hearts and minds as the UK breaks apart, so war in the streets with bombs and guns is pathetic(though I sometimes wonder if the IRA groups that currently exist are actually British Psyops.) I also think the war of hearts and minds is a lost cause and we are just going to be an international hub that serves Capitalist interests under the wing of the EU for a long time to come, so my idea of creating a Gaelic identity with people living in parts of the world where the Gaelic languages have been spoken, well it's nothing more than a desperate pipe dream to keep some ember of hope lit, as we all become the globalist ass puppets of Neoliberal Capitalists. And that's all this globalism thing is about, the pro-migration stuff: it's so people can be torn from their local cultures and become part of the corrupt Capitalist system, shifted around as resources to work and make a profit. Marx thinks this is a necessary step towards the establishment of a global Communist way of life, but I think he was wrong and we are headed more in the cyberpunk selling our own bodies back to us dystopia direction and that the divide between rich and poor will only keep growing. If that makes me sound like a commie, well I hate labels but if it quacks like a duck maybe it is one. Point is I think we're all fucked together, I don't think the nations of Britain will escape, England won't escape, and I know the EU is just part of the problem which is why the far left opposed the EU despite lies that it's only the racist far right. I don't attack immigrants because I know we are in the same boat, most of us as people are chumps, and it's not the fault of individual immigrants, the problem is the root cause and the few who control this cartel of a global order. That's why I oppose Anglo-American media and propaganda, in case it seemed like I wasn't gonna finish with a point. Anglo-American media is not exactly full of support for minority cultures and anti-capitalists. 

I mean people can say: ""bUt cUlTuRe dEvEloPs rEtArd"", that it simply changes. Then I remember people in Hawaii sickened they are seen more as a tourist spot, that people don't know there was foul play when they ""voted"" to join the US and continue getting ""whited out"" as one American jingoist said. Bred them out he also said. Bred. I remember Puerto Rico, how the population there mostly wants to be a US State, despite how badly the US treats them, how the US pisses Anglo-American culture on them and they open their mouths. I remember what rebels there told me about not wanting to become Hawaii 2.0, how gringos and tourists are disrespectful, how the poor and destitute are offered low wages to work in Alaska. At what cost is this sometimes positive Anglo-American culture? We need ways to keep it at bay, or did need ways, it's most likely too late. A racist once told me they ""gave those savages toilets and electricity"", my people were called savages too, Voltaire who wrote a favourite novella of mine, Candide, called the Irish savages. I was disappointed to learn that, but his writing is good, imo, nonetheless. Just in case anyone here thinks they are talking to an idiot, I understand things change, the problem is that Ireland is this way because of mostly negative circumstances, being attacked and judged by many as savages. And we are still insulted, and laughed at by many. 

The situation here is bad, Ireland has been called a suicide box. Emigration is the norm, and then there's immigration: we apparently need to bring in more foreign people because of Britain letting Ireland starve and calling it the work of God. I don't blame the immigrants, I blame the British, and the Royal family that let it happen. I am not the type to scream at a black person or Muslim, I have seen too many Irish scumbags to judge a foreigner here for work and to survive. I will never forget what happened, and I am getting sick of Anglo-American culture though I grew up with it. I am not the only one who thinks something is wrong with the world, look up what experts say about civilization collapsing, apparently it just may be soon. Maybe that's why some rich assholes want to flee to Mars after getting random assholes to build habitats there as ""pioneers.""

"gli71w7","So, my response comes from a place of having been through all the games, a few times (ergo, ample spoilers!!!)...

I believe that when Solas says ‚Äúour people,‚Äù whether or not he actually IS a hypocrite, he does not see his usage of the phrase as hypocritical. This is because, when elves refer to ‚Äúour people,‚Äù they are referencing the Dalish, whereas, when Solas refers to ‚Äúour people,‚Äù he speaks of the Elvhen (spelling?)- the race of elves as they once used to be, whose differences to modern elves are so vast that he considers them to be another race entirely. In his mind, the modern Dalish are but a tainted shadow of what they once were, utterly broken and ignorant of what they used to be. Thus he refuses to be allied with modern elves, but has no problem collectively referring to himself as part of the Elvhen. Why he does not simply work to help them rediscover who they once were is another matter open for debate (and frustrates the crap outta me), but I suspect it has to do with his wounded pride at being hurt by so many elves in the past (recall the ugliness of the past war and ‚Äúold gods‚Äù that led to the formation of the Fade in the first place). So- ‚Äúthey hurt me, screw them‚Äù is his present elvish mantra. 

As for the uses of Da‚ÄôLen/Hahren, regardless of what the elves believe or think they know- Solas really is REALLY OLD. LOL So, yes, technically the terms fit, even if he isn‚Äôt much ‚Äòrespectable,‚Äô imo, his age still earns him the right to the respectful title. (It‚Äôs linguistics- you see it in other languages as well.)

If an individual member wore Holocaust denial shirt that‚Äôs bad but it in no way makes the whole group a white supremacy movement. You‚Äôre just one of those people that call everything you don‚Äôt like white supremacy out of total ignorance. You probably think Candace Owens is a white supremacist too don‚Äôt you? Just like Trump said about Charlottesville there were some very bad people there, the white supremacists and new nazis should be condemned fully, but there were good people on both sides of that fight. There were bad people on both sides of that fight. Just because there were some people that were for the statue being removed that protested it, that doesn‚Äôt make them Antifa terrorists. By that same logic just because there were white supremacist there it doesn‚Äôt make them Proud boys. If you knew anything about the proud boys instead of being ignorant and believing propaganda forced upon you by a very biased media. ( that does for both sides whether it be Fox Breitbart daily wire OANN NY post and Newsmax or CNN MSNBC ABC CNBC NBC Young Turks occupy democrats huff post Washington post NY times etc. ) they were started by Gavin McGinnis a right wing provocateur developed into a bigger movement.

No one is going around committing prove-able crimes and getting away with it because it was on an Reservation or any other privately owned land.  I agree it‚Äôs an issue that people can‚Äôt be arrested or detained when they commit a crime but when we allow fake cops on reservations to arrest people we also allow fake cops at Walmart or any other private business to do the same. 
I never said racism only exists against white people that‚Äôs beyond ignorant. It speaks to your underdeveloped brain to even think that. Are you a racist or are you just a kid who‚Äôs cognitive abilities haven‚Äôt fully developed? Affirmative actions effects everyone. When applying to college it disproportionately affects Asians, Indians and Jews, before whites, but the part most people especially those that have never looked into the issue (that‚Äôs you) is that no one is told whether they were allowed in due to affirmative action, so a black student who has worked their ass off to get to where they are at Harvard will never have the same since of accomplishment as that Indian student never knowing if they truly made it on their own merits or were let in based on a racist law. Furthermore for an Asian to get into medical school requires a 3.8 GPA Indians need a 3.7 whites a 3.6 Hispanics need a 3.3 and black student need only a 2.8 this puts  some black students Hispanics and whites in a class they‚Äôre not qualified to be in causing failing rates higher than that of the Indians Jews and Asians. When they fail out they‚Äôre stuck with a massive debt that can not be repaid without that high paying doctor job which pushed a cycle of poverty on them. 
Critical race theory is pure hatred it‚Äôs literally propaganda of learned hatred. Despite what group is singles out as evil or better than everyone else it causes nothing but hate and forced people to see each other as their race instead as their fellow Americans.

---

I want to preface by saying that I 100% agree that the US is behind the times with social reform. Universal healthcare, free education, poverty assistance, there is A LOT that can be reformed within our government and we have numerous countries whose history and wisdom we can rely on to enact those changes. But I still feel there are a lot of people on reddit who would belittle America genuinely, for not being current on social policies that the rest of the world has caught up on.

Personally I feel this is just a disingenuous attitude. America is still relatively young compared to most other first world countries. There is a lot of work that needs to be done legally, and a lot of legal precedence that we just don't have for lawmakers to refer to. It just feels unfair to judge America (and Americans) for being behind the times when we don't have this legal precedent or history we can rely on like many first world countries. England has existed in some form or another far longer than the US, and their system of government has remained relatively consistent. Hell, English Parliament was established in 1215. So England has had far more time to work out the kinks of their governing system, and have had longer than 2 centuries to establish legal precedent for the laws they make today, yet they only passed universal healthcare 73 years ago. The US is only about 250 years old, we certainly have history (and not always good history) but not the kind of history that many other nations on Earth have, yet it seems America is subject of mockery because we haven't yet worked out all of the kinks of our governing body, or established law that prevents people like Trump from gaining power. For my best comparison it's like a king dying and leaving the succession to his 9 year old son, and then the people shit talk the son when he doesn't know the intricacies of running a kingdom and everything goes to shit.

That being said, there is a fuck ton I don't know about the world, and I am more than happy to learn and adjust this opinion as I learn more. If anybody has information on any topics I talked about I would love to get it.

"gl12f08","&gt;The difference is women have decent options in men they overlook fir the shallowest of reasons. 

No, see, you just think that for *all women*. That's the problem. Rather than painting with a broad brush, I'm telling you, from firsthand talking to many, that a sizeable portion of women do not have decent options available to them‚Äîor, rather, the indecent ones *perfectly* blend in with the decent ones and make it impossible to tell the difference. They are regularly used for sex, under-valued, lied to, or completely ignored by otherwise \*seemingly\* good dudes. And it makes for a very difficult to feel like you have any options when time after time after time after time you meet someone who ""might be different and decent this time"" but ends up treating the same goddamn way. 

In the same way your invisibility is an illusion, so is ""everyone wants to use me."" It's confirmation bias. My point is that *both* are lies people tell themselves. And stupidly enough, they make it a pity-party where they feel the *other* side is being silly and ignorant of the ""real^(TM)"" struggle. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt know a single guy who would reject a woman because she is two inches taller than he typically likes or her breasts are a size smaller.

NAWALT. And don't confuse real attraction from picky bullshit. Some men only want to date ultra hot women because they see it as a status symbol (there's your ""opposite of invisibility vs. her being used"" right there). But some just find them attractive. Similarly, some (a minority I'd say) women are, for whatever reason, deeply attracted to height or whatever else. 

&gt;Women reject shorter men all the time because they feel entitled to someone from literally the top 15% of all men.

Nah, I'm only 172cm and do just fine. 

&gt;But when I‚Äôm fit, making $150,000 a year, with retirement sorted, the fat single mom I‚Äôm expected to date doesn‚Äôt compare to the average guy the average woman is expected to date.

You sound entitled as fuck, dude. And this is also just bullshit. Nobody is telling you to date anyone you aren't attracted to. *That's the whole fucking point.* I guarantee you most women are not doing this weird over-filtering you're imagining. Are you only dating online or something??

&gt;Men are expected to settle way more than women and pretending our struggles are comparable is ludicrous

Don't preach, make arguments. Preaching doesn't work for me.

&gt;No one demands the average woman settle for a fat neckbeard, just a guy that may not look like he walked off the pages of GQ. It seems even that is a stretch in 2021.

"gl0az1g","&gt; Additionally, it didn‚Äôt seem to matter before because people were making the best product possible, and ignorant of social issues or not, didn‚Äôt make that the priority.

Eh, I just think I fundamentally disagree there. There have always been bad shows with bad writing, and I think the push for more diversity highlights a different kind of bad writing, where hamfisted ""wokeness"" starts to interfere with characterization/storytelling, but that doesn't mean that those shows would be great if they didn't have the diversity. That bad writing would manifest elsewhere, just like it used to in the countless bad shows from the early 2000s and earlier that we've collectively forgotten about.

On the flip side, there are *great* movies/shows that are extremely social issue/diversity-minded and make it a priority, but the quality is still there. I just don't think there's really a strong correlation between the two concepts. A focus on social issues and diversity or not, some things will be good, some things will be bad. The world spins round.

And either way, personally, I'm willing to forgive some bad or forgettable content that doesn't handle diversity well because on a broad scale I think the trend towards more inclusive casting and storytelling is a good thing for the industry and a good thing for our culture. I'd prefer that over having almost all content ‚Äì good and bad ‚Äì be about straight white people.

&gt;If Lost was created now, I personally don‚Äôt think it would be a fraction as good, because a huge priority would be placed on diversifying the cast before anything else, especially on a large ensemble piece.

See it's funny, because I think if Lost came out today ‚Äì and it was the exact same show with the exact same cast and the exact same writing ‚Äì people would criticize the diversity as being ""forced"" and ""too woke"", because that's the hot button topic of the day. A Middle Eastern character who faces racist abuse from a southern American 3 years after 9/11 is just as on-the-nose as most of the shit people complain about these days! But because it was made in a different time, and people have nostalgia for it now, it's remembered well.

"gl00fck","Interesting take. I‚Äôd go back to my original point, however, that people are more divided now than they were 10 years ago.

If influencing culture using entertainment has always been a goal, then at least before, it was more subtle. Now it‚Äôs obvious enough that many people have noticed, and actively reject and mock this type of media based on its on-the-nose messaging.

Additionally, it didn‚Äôt seem to matter before because people were making the best product possible, and ignorant of social issues or not, didn‚Äôt make that the priority. The only real issue I have with any of this is when the entertainment I consume is eye-rollingly compromised by shallow attempts at diversity.

"gkzaal7","My normal play has been large group pvp, heroic dungeons and LFR raids as a healer.  At that level it dosnt matter what the big boys are doing on YouTube.  Any of the classes will preform their duty regardless of the word on the streets about them.  So if you love a character‚Äôs play style you can do those things without worry.

So there‚Äôs some BUTS on both sides about playing non-meta characters.  If you want to do mythics where you must form your own groups you are essentially doing it how we did it in classic.  We‚Äôd stand in front of a dungeon and pick people.  If you had a mage and a shadow priest you‚Äôd pick the mage and too often shadow was told to go respec to holy and stop the nonsense.  Boomkins were simply too meme for the masses to take and warriors were chosen over paly or bears then too.  The same picking goes on for mythics too.  You apply to a group and they can take or reject you. It‚Äôs not infront of you like it was and maybe that‚Äôs easier but it still feels bad not getting picked.  

I‚Äôd argue that non-meta classes can still do low keys but that won‚Äôt matter when your sitting there not getting picked because the masses watched the championships and demon hunters were the tanks.  People can see their mobility and massive dps and that‚Äôs what they think they need.  They are unimaginative and ignorant of what other tanks can bring to the table.  So if you and a similar DH apply they will take the DH because it feels safe based on what they watched.  It‚Äôs their key so it‚Äôs their choice.  If you want to do prot and mythics you‚Äôll get less groups right now.  If you use your own key though you‚Äôll get people for sure as there‚Äôs so many dps looking for groups that you‚Äôll really only need a healer to not care.

As a final note this has been my experience: I picked Mistweaver for this expansion as it was the only healer I didn‚Äôt have.  Turns out it‚Äôs in the dumpster like prot is.  I did try Mythic+4s with it but I was able to see its problems emerging that people online were highlighting. MWs easily run outa mana and do not have some very helpful tools in their kits that some healers do.  I just pulled my Druid out this week and started gearing them.  I was at ilvl 200 on my monk and I feel my Druid has a similar feeling for healing at ilvl 170. I am doing less healing HPS when I run the numbers but my heals feel good and I have some solid utility in my kit.  

So my advice is that what the reviews are saying are mostly on the money about specs, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they are unplayable.  You might have it easier at a lower ilvl on a meta character.  My suggestion is put some time into your warrior and plan to overgear them for the content your aiming at.  Do be realistic about the tools you have and don‚Äôt have as those can‚Äôt not be changed.  DKs get a battle Rez for instance and that‚Äôs an amazing tool for a tank to stand a healer back up for instance.

"gk58txp","""For every rule in biology, there are exceptions. This is due to information that we have not discovered yet. But it doesn't mean that a truth doesn't exist."" Well actually, it does. What you view as truth is very different from reality. What colour your eyes perceive isn't the same as mine, which in turn isn't the same as the way a dog perceives colour. Then you have creatures such as snakes, that can visually see the infrared spectrum that we can't perceive. Or pigeons that can see the electromagnetic spectrum. If you're trying to find a perfect truth then you're in pursuit of something unobtainable. The actual truth is that every being is unique. You cannot define a living thing into a category without there been exceptions, even within the same species. This is core to biology because it‚Äôs why we are not all clones of one another. You're trying to categorise them based on a strict set of criteria which is insanity. These beings don't even have the same criteria they did half an hour ago. Living things fluctuate and change. If you define a creature anatomically, the creature will lose a limb. If you define them hormonally, their hormone fluctuates naturally over time. You cannot define sex because ""sex"" isn't a definition. It's a category born from several other factors - Physiological, hormonal, genetic and several other less impactful ones. Even genetically, a binary model cannot cover that we observe several distinct variations in our karyotypes. If XY is one category and XX is another, shouldn't XXY, XXXY, XXX, XXXX, XXYY, XXXXX, XXXXY, XYY be their own categories? How do you define which karyotype belongs to male or female?

""But that definition is beyond the scope of my knowledge and so I cannot define it for you."" This isn't based on knowledge, that's the whole point. It's based on the lack of a natural dividing line between a dog and a wolf. A general (but loose) definition of a species is that it becomes a distinct species when they can no longer interbreed, but many dogs and wolves can. So, we instead say that dogs are two generations from wolves (a problematic definition). This is a different rule to what we use to govern other creatures. This is an example of how your dividing lines don't work. Nature doesn't have categories. We humans try to impose a dividing line to simplify things but they are arbitrary. What even qualifies as a single organism? Does the bacteria in our gut count as human? Or part of a human? A human cannot exist without it. Is it a symbiotic relationship or an infection? What happens when it's your own bodies cells as in the case of cancer? What defines cancer? How does a foetus differ from a cancer? These may seem very simple on the face of it, but they are anything but simple. A cancer is a malign growth of your own cells. A foetus could actually qualify as a cancer by certain definitions. Of course, we use a mature approach to the subject, rather than sticking to this naive view that the definitions are fact because they are not.

""The reason that the binary model is the best current definition of sex is because it is based on simple and precise fact. There are only 2 reproductive roles."" Ok, so which role does a male with functioning breast tissue fill? Male, female or both? Science says that a male with functioning breast tissue is still a male but has a trait that is female. Your definition instantly breaks because you're saying that there is a clear dividing line which simply isn't the case. This male could fill a ""male sexual role"" as you put it, but could also fill part of the females role. Is uterus that has never functioned still a uterus? Does this still qualify them as a woman in your eyes? This may seem like a simple question but it's really not. How do you define a uterus from cancer? They are the same cells. You can take this to something far simpler and still not get a decisive result. Is a broken car still a car or scrap metal? It doesn't fill the role of a car. Maybe it never did. It may not even look like a car anymore. At what defining point does a car become a piece of metal? Science says it was always a piece of metal that was also a car. You're saying that there is a defining line between the two. See below for the absurdity of your hammer analogy. 

""these circumstances do not classify a third sex because these are not separate distinct sexual roles."" But a lot of people don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsexual role‚Äù and you‚Äôve yet to provide an actual definition. You‚Äôve chopped and changed it based on new circumstances and disregarded reality. A woman who cannot give birth, under your first definition wasn‚Äôt a woman. Then you said that they are because they still have the reproductive parts, but the parts may never have been reproductive. So how do you define that? A woman is a person who may or may not have reproductive parts? I‚Äôm asking this because I know you can‚Äôt answer it. I‚Äôm hoping you realise that what you‚Äôre trying to do here is an exercise in futility. 

""Your argument is that because our binary model is not perfect in classifying people that it must be wrong and therefore the definition of sex is completely wrong."" That isn't my argument. My argument is that you're trying to put an arbitrary dividing line into a complex system that doesn't have such distinctions and you‚Äôre doing so in spite of evidence to the contrary. You cannot define male or female in a human as any set of criteria or characteristics. It's too simple and ignorant of the reality and lived experience of the person and our species overall. My view is the same as sciences. We try to define it, but we admit that there are exceptions. You're not doing this. You're saying there are no exceptions, only a lack of knowledge. That everyone falls into one of two categories. This is demonstrably false. Why? Give me a definition for the ""strict sexual roles"" that I cannot break or find an exception to and you will have an argument, but that is not, and will never be the case, regardless of how much knowledge we have. So ultimately, this idea is a non-starter.

""We know that there do exist intersex people and infertile people, but based on the definition of sex, these circumstances do not classify a third sex because these are not separate distinct sexual roles."" They don't have a sexual role, so they fit neither category under your definition. So instantly you have to invoke a third category anyway. ""Other"" or ""non-functioning"" or whatever. So there goes the binary...You did that. Instantly...

""Hammers are a specifically designed tool for a certain purpose. Many hammers will look different but they all serve the same purpose. Let's say you're using a hammer and the head falls off rendering it useless. The item does not cease to be a hammer."" Is a spanner a hammer? It can be used as one, so by your definition, it is one. It looks different from the other hammers but that's fine according to your definition. So all spanners are hammers. I've also used screwdriver handles so they class as hammers too. This is going to make DIY very confusing the time I visit IKEA...Its too simplistic‚Ä¶

""It simply A majority of infertile people can be sufficiently classified into either male or female. A minority of intersex people are entirely ambiguous, and for these cases I would say they are sufficiently male and female."" Well no they can't because you already said they can't. They don't fill a sexual role. That was your criteria. You can‚Äôt rely on a ‚Äústrict sexual role‚Äù and then disregard it when it suits your argument. The only reason you‚Äôre even able to do this is because you‚Äôre so vague in what a ‚Äúsexual role‚Äù even is. Your first definition described it, but was full of flaws. Instead of updating it when confronted with post-menopausal women, you clarified that they still have previously reproductive parts. So in the case of non-fertile people, they may never have had reproductive parts. So we‚Äôre back to the beginning of what qualifies as a reproductive part in these ‚ÄúSexual roles‚Äù? What is your definition of sex? What you‚Äôve done is use circular reasoning and that is a logical fallacy. You‚Äôre forcing reality into your boxes which isn‚Äôt science. You‚Äôre starting at the conclusion and working backwards. 

To summarize, your view is that everyone is male or female but you cannot define the characteristics that qualify a male or a female. This ""sexual role"" is vague and many humans fall into neither category (instantly invoking a third category anyway). You need to clarify this because your whole argument is based upon it. Whether you do or don‚Äôt, this model is filled with flaws and loopholes and doesn‚Äôt describe the reality we live in, which is the entire point of science! Your model doesn‚Äôt even qualify as scientific hypothesis because you‚Äôre starting with a conclusion. You have made no attempt to change the categories based on observation so at this point it‚Äôs a belief system. No different from the greek gods, flat earth or brain leeching alien slugs. Until you have something that disproves the current model then I‚Äôm afraid you have got nothing. Binary isn‚Äôt the current model and hasn‚Äôt been since the 1950‚Äôs. You‚Äôre 70 years out of date. People have been born, lived their lives and died since then. When you mentioned a lack of knowledge earlier, it isn‚Äôt a collective lack of knowledge. It‚Äôs your own lack of knowledge on this subject. I‚Äôve attached a few articles from scientific publications below. They reference their sources and studies (not as clear as I would have liked but they‚Äôre there) but they‚Äôre a far easier to read and understand than the studies themselves.

It wasn‚Äôt easy, as they learned that not all humans sleep during the night as they thought, but they managed to get it done. Zenxar wanted to see if humans were as divisive and judgmental as everyone claimed they are, so he gave the humans dots to see if the claims were correct.

Zenxar, walked in to the bridge and greeted his crew mates. ‚ÄúHow have the humans adapted to these dots?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúWell sir‚Äù one of his lieutenants replied ‚Äúit seems like it‚Äôs been a mixed reception all around. As we initially predicted, many of the more reasonable ones went about their lives as if nothing had changed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear.‚Äù Zenxar stated.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more. A bunch of theories have begun to pop up as to what they mean. Some say they were caused by extraterrestrials‚Äù Zenxar almost chuckled at the sound of that. ‚ÄúWhile others have claimed that certain dots mean that someone belongs to certain hate groups.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? Is that true?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir, our studies have shown that all groups have a variety of different colored dots. While some have more of one color than the others, it‚Äôs not enough to draw that kind of a conclusion.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds terrible!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt gets worse I‚Äôm afraid.

‚ÄúSir! Sir!‚Äù Another crewmen interrupted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrible! A significant portion of the humans have resorted to bodily harm!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Zenxar replied in shock.

Zenxar hung his head in sorrow. These false claims had driven many to commit harm upon themselves. It was a terrible thought to think. As much as he hated to admit it, his experiment was a success.

Conservative beliefs: 

- I believe that the United States must continue to be the militarily, economically, culturally, and politically strongest and most powerful nation on the planet where no one will challenge our strength. If I had my way, the United States will continue to the the global superpower until the end of days or whenever the sun burns itself out and wipes our entire planet out of existence. 

- I believe in possessing the strongest and most powerful military in the world and I‚Äôm not opposed to our global military presence. Because of our military strength and international presence, we‚Äôve been able to fight for our interests in far-away places, defend our allies, keep maritime trade routes open and free, stand up to countries like China, as well as help people all over the world by providing humanitarian assistance (whenever a large and catastrophic natural disaster hits, we‚Äôre usually the first and/or the largest force to respond). If I had my way, the US military will be the most powerful force in all human history until a massive meteorite wipes our planet out or whatever. 

-  If I had my way, every single law-abiding American who is mentally fit and capable would be encouraged to have guns of any kind. You want an AR-15? No problem. You thinking about getting that AK-75? Have at it. You want a fully functional M61 Vulcan autocannon? You got it. I also think that some gun laws (e.g. limited magazine sizes) are incredibly stupid and ignorant of reality and were only passed to appease those who don‚Äôt have a clue about guns or the dangers of the real world. Shit, I wish that I could buy an M777 along with all of the projectiles that come with it without having to pay a ton of money just for the paperwork alone. 

- I have no problems with patriotism. I am a very proud and extremely patriotic American and I love my country along with the Constitution. I believe that we‚Äôre one of the greatest nations on the planet and despite our flaws, we will always come out strong. 

- Identity politics and a lot of the other actions of SJWs are stupid and serve little purpose. I also hate how everything is now made about race and in some circles, I‚Äôm suppose to have a particular view or feeling towards something just because of the fact that I‚Äôm Asian. 

- I support the police. Call me a bootlicker if you want (oh no an overused insult that‚Äôs only used when you can‚Äôt come up with a good argument wow you did a great job hurting my fragile feelings üôÑ) but I support the police due to the fact that they have a thankless job and will get shitted on by people no matter what they do or don‚Äôt do. And they will continue to keep doing their job despite all of the hate. Props to them for being able to go through all of the hatred and insult while still maintaining their bearing. 

- Capitalism is a great system of economics/socio-economics since it (ideally) gives the common man the power and ability to become wealthy if they work hard enough and have discipline, dedication, and can hustle in order to get what they want. 

Liberal views: 

- I‚Äôm not totally sure that I‚Äôm completely sold on the idea of universal healthcare but I do believe that healthcare should be more accessible to the public. I understand the logic as to why hospital bills are pretty expensive at times but I still think that medical care shouldn‚Äôt be as expensive as it is right now. 

- I think that the minimum wage should be raised in order to accommodate things like where people live. 

- I strongly believe in education and I think that having an educated society that can critically think will do wonders for our country and our progress as a nation. 

- Not a big fan of religion being somewhat prevalent within some conservative circles. 

- I‚Äôm pro-choice. I can understand the reasoning behind being pro-life but I think that the woman has the ultimate say in her choice since it‚Äôs her body that‚Äôs cooking up a baby. Why should anyone get a say in how she wants to handle herself, especially if she‚Äôs mentally capable to make her own decisions? 

- While I support the police and think that shit like ACAB is stupid, we have to face reality and accept that like every single other profession out there, shitty assholes slip through the cracks and become cops.

"gjmfp96","&gt; Hell, I could use it in an effective way to prove that someone like Floyd, who was born in institutionalized poverty and racially charged conditions which removed many opportunities from his life at a young age had very little choice but becoming a petty delinquent.

It's almost like... stay with me now... if he was mentored and rehabilitated when he first started acting like a delinquent maybe he would be better off?  That maybe living in a society where we are all about consequences and punishment lead to him using counterfeit money that caused his murder in the first place?

&gt; If you are right, and the reason she tbehaves that way is because her parents failed to raise her properly, protecting her from deserved circumstances as she comes out of age is not going to do her any favors later in life. At one point the coddling needs to stop and she needs to learn to behave in society.

I mean shit seems like you would have been all about Biden's '94 crime bill I mean as you said ""Consequences to your actions and choices are important, regardless of your age."" With that logic all those black teens who ended up in juvie for pretty drug crimes deserved to have their futures ruined.

&gt;Besides, it's not as though she's entirely innocent and ignorant of the vileness of her behavior. She several times acknowledges that other people are not going to like what she has to say and belligerently dismisses their concern. 

A teenager saying something that might piss off other people say it ain't so!  Stop acting like that isn't something the majority of teenagers do at some point.  She just said something 1000s of backwards ass adults have said to no consequence, but people want to hold her accountable for it for a bit of freudenschade.

&gt;You cannot possibly have kids if you believe that allowing a challenge accompanying misbehavior is going to result in anything else but a learned belief that you can be walked over.

Actually I do have a kid, but unlike my father did to me, I don't beat his ass when he makes a mistake or does something wrong I actually talk to him about it and try to figure out the root to why he did what he did and work on it.  But hey I'm sure to you that's not enough consequences for a child.

&gt; Moreover, we are talking about a man whose LIFE was taken from him, and here you are clutching pearls over a white, privileged, entitled woman losing her first choice of university?

First I don't think clutching pearls means what you think it means and second we are talking about a CHILD not a woman.  Yes we are talking about a man's life but your acting as if somehow her words caused his death.  Also we are not just talking about losing her first choice but losing a scholarship.  But I can tell you you think her 'privalege' is going to make sure everything works out for her and that this isn't going to follow her for years or affect her getting into another college.


&gt; She will be fine, she can choose another and hopefully not be a braggart about it and go on living her life more quietly and maybe acquire a better understanding of consequences in life.

Again this shows you are only worried about punishment.  You don't care if she changes her views you just hope this keeps her from stating them in public.

"gjjmj0q","&gt;Just because there are more white people affected as an absolute number doesnt mean theyre affected the same as a proportion of the population.

You are missing the point. My point is that, without intent, you are describing a problem, but not racism. I have no particular interest to break down prison policy, but what you have presented is not racism because racism is inherently an intent based sin.

&gt;Also my example very very broadly lays out several systems that perpetuate those disproportionately bad outcomes,

""Disproportionally bad outcomes"" aren't racism unless they are caused by intentional mal action. If a system operates on two people who are otherwise the same other than race in the same manner, as the one you described does, we are not talking about race, but at best class. 

And there inlies the thing you aren't getting. 

Stop calling criticisms of systems you don't like systemic racism unless the driving cause of the divide is actually racism. One, because it makes your argument easier to dismantle by tying it to a horse that is far harder to prove. Tow, it's divisive on it's face, as you say, if it effects poor people generally, why make it a race issue in the first place?

&gt;Also just because white people aren't affected as much as a proportion of their population, wouldn't we want to help those people too?

Sure, but you saying this proves it isn't fucking racism, just a bad system for pragmatic reasons.

Racism can not exist absent of intent to cause harm on the basis of race. That is what racism is.

What you have described is a system that incidentally causes disproportionate outcomes based on race not as a driver, but as a consequence of extremely complex histories that create a preexistent class disparity. If everyone woke up tomorrow and was collored gray nothing would change, and thus the system isn't systemically racist. it's just a bad system.

&gt; (which are again not debated)

&gt; Claiming ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù when someone states that all violence is bad or that you‚Äôre a hypocrite if you support some violence but oppose it elsewhere - it‚Äôs intellectually lazy, extremely divisive, and ignorant of legitimate criticisms. 

This is all true, but what's more important is that this style of thinking (as well as that of the Trump ""insurrectionists"") is now what the very fabric of reality is composed of.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to get people to realize this, or understand it's importance.  It's a very slippery concept.  People think reality is what we see out the window, but that is only a small portion of reality, the materialistic portion.  The larger *and more important* part of reality is non-materialistic, and exists only within our mind: *our perception of reality*.  And it is this non-materialistic *perception of reality* that controls how *materialistic reality* unfolds.  

Some people may chuckle at such ideas, dismissing them as Metaphysical Masturbation or something of the sort.

So ordinarily (in my admittedly limited experience) if you were ever in a social situation with a person who uses different pronouns they would tell you that they preferred to be addressed by a different set of pronouns, or if not you might unintentionally address them by the wrong pronouns and they'd correct you; then you can both move on with whatever you were talking about. From my experience addressing someone by the wrong pronouns only becomes a problem when a person continually uses the wrong pronouns as a  deliberate attempt to undermine another person. How would you feel if someone kept addressing you by the wrong pronouns - it would get annoying quickly. 

""How tf can a gender be gay?????""

Ummm... What? I think you may have been misinformed on this one or I may have misunderstood what you were getting at. I'm not LGBTQ+ (well AFAIK) but I will try and explain it to you from my understanding: 

Sex = your biological make-up i.e. your chromosomes so there are: XY which is male, XX which is female, and there are very rare occurrences of those who are intersex XXY for example. Basically what genitals you had when you were born. 

Gender = whether you psychologically are/feel male, female, or another. Gender is not 1 or the other (non-binary, you may have heard that term before) it's a spectrum. Overwhelmingly most people psychologically align with the gender that they were assigned at birth (i.e based on their sex). For example, my sex is male,  and my gender is male as I feel psychologically that I am a man. 

Sexuality = Crudely who you wanna bang (if anyone). So your sexuality is linked to, but not the same as your sex or your gender. So for example if your gender identity is male and you are only attracted to other people who identify as male then you would be gay. If someone's sex and gender are different (for example if someone was assigned  female at birth, but identifies as male) and is attracted to other people who identified as male they would also be considered gay; as to the best of my understanding gender:gender determines your sexuality rather than what junk you've got. 

I used to be confused and ignorant of the gender/sex difference until it was explained to me. In my view why not let other people live their life as they see fit while you live yours as you see fit. If you're still confused I'd highly recommend reading [this](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender#sex) and maybe posting on r/explainlikeimfive or another question sub where you can have an open dialogue with people in the LGBTQ+ community. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Sex and  gender ARE NOT  the same and CANNOT be used interchangeably. Just let other people get on with their lives without worrying about whether their gender  and genitals match up, because it doesn't make a difference to your life!

It's not, and there are unironic deluded black supremacists out there; [look up Hoteps if you're not aware.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw5bYlTs9Wk) Sure, they're a minority and almost entirely harmless, but honestly, so are your real actual white supremacists.

There is a boatload of resentment (a massive understatement) between blacks and whites for obvious reasons, and while black people obviously have a real reason for that resentment, and white people do not, it is very clearly stoked to serve the interests of capital, which doesn't help build class solidarity.

&gt;You're going to bitch about how leftists who care abt """"identity politics"""" are """"""""SJWS"""""" who don't want to build class solidarity

I never said the word SJW, but thanks for putting words in my mouth. But no, I do believe that they want to build class solidarity. I just don't think they're going about it in an effective manner. 

&gt; unironically talking about ""South Asian supremacy"" as if it's a real thing???

Yes. The way I grew up, I was taught to see myself as better than the native white population because we were more educated and made more money. My interactions with them were always marked by some kind of classism, perhaps as a defense mechanism against racism I faced. Maybe you never experienced this, but I did, so I included it. As I grew up of course, I realized how dumb and  this is. I apologize if this is too anecdotal, I might've made the classic mistake of thinking my experiences can be mapped onto everyone else's. 

Also, I hope you're not trying to pretend that Hindu nationalism is not on the rise and a huge threat to every religious minority in India currently. Sure, it's not ""South Asian supremacy"" (bad wording on my part), but so many Indians support Modi because they're brainwashed as hell, most of my family unfortunately notwithstanding. Hatred and prejudice is not exclusive to Europeans, and thinking that that is the case is paradoxically incredibly racist and ignorant of a majority of recorded history, most of which has nothing to do with Europeans at all. Recorded history is primarily West African, East African, North African, South Asian, Southwest Asian, Chinese, Mesoamerican, South American, and finally, European.

&gt;If you dismiss the extent to which capitalist society uses identity as a means of further entrenching class inequality, and how one's identity as defined by a capitalist system dictates whose labour gets exploited and for what purpose, you are not building class solidarity. In fact, you're enabling existing hierarchies that contribute to the exploitation of other segments of the working class you claim unity with.

I am not dismissing this. All I am trying to say is that using left-wing identity politics to fight right-wing identity politics does not work. First of all, fixing class-based concerns will help EVERYONE. The low-income gay couple might feel socially ostracised, but they will be much better off having access to free healthcare and cheap housing. The homeless black and native people who live in tents in my city in the deep of winter might experience someone calling them racial slurs, but at least they will have homes, healthcare, and ability to fight back.

Most importantly, not appealing to identity politics means we can get the white majority on our side. Why is this important? Sheer population and electoral support. There is no possible change you can get in America without appealing to the white majority in some way or another. Sure, they're not a homogenous voting block, but as it turns out, telling people they're racist, sexist, etc. for their random socially ignorant opinions, which in my experience, nearly everyone older than 25 has, is not conducive to gaining support from them.

I say this as someone who before reading this thread thought it was just a bad date, and then took the time to review the original article and various opinions on it.

There are lots of instances that could be misconstrued as genuine consent, but you'd have to be pretty ignorant to think that (like I assume Aziz was in that moment).  For instance, after she says she needs a break and goes to the bathroom, she comes out and says, ""I don't want to feel forced because then I'll hate you, and I don't want to hate you."" Then Aziz affirms the sentiment that if she's not ok with it, it's not ok, and they should just chill on the couch.  Then when they're on the couch, he motioned  towards his penis indicating to her to go down on him (which she then reluctantly did).  While this isn't exactly wrong, it shows how sleazy and ignorant of the situation he was. If she just expressed discomfort and feelings of pressure, then you should be extra careful to make sure she doesn't feel that anymore. Clearly he made no attempts of doing that.

A bad date would be if the guy is shit at kissing, is not interesting, and/or doesn't know how to make conversation.  This is clearly worse than that.

There were other instances in the incident that appear to have lacked affirmative consent, which makes it even worse.  For example, he would repeatedly stick two fingers in her mouth and she would repeatedly try to get away but he would keep on following and do it.
