"hqnns56","God's and higher powers are a HUGE escalation for explaining things that humans don't know or understand.

And for the past 200,000 years if humans encountered *anything* they didn't understand well right away, they immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was the unknowable workings of some deity or other. But the truth was the humans just didn't have the tools to view the phenomenon they were experiencing *correctly.*

As soon as we invent a technology that allows us to see the phenomena more accurately, somehow the almighty will of the god that once controlled it can be subverted and manipulated at our pleasure.

How many other phenomena do we not yet understand simply because we haven't invented the technology to get a good look at what's going on? How much do we not yet know? 

Is it not premature -no matter how good our technology is, and no matter how much we think we know- to just assume the universe, existence, and consciousness have anything to do with some mysterious higher power?

Don't we have a LOT of work to do to understand what we can about such things before we start assuming (without direct evidence of such activity) that there is some higher power responsible for ALL the phenomena -both that which we are aware and unaware of?

Is it not a mistake to assume that there is such a small gap between the end of what humans now understand, and the unfathomable, infinite, eternal workings of and potential gods or higher powers?

"hqm0bjt","&gt; Jesus *had* to have been an illiterate peasant

Arguably one of the most annoying presumptions I come across in this field.

The canonical tradition has him reading in temple and arguing with rabbis in childhood. In his ministry he's depicted arguing with Pharisees on the nuances of the Law and networked with wealthy patrons. Apocrypha like *Thomas* have him being perceived as ""a wise philosopher.""

If he were an intellectually gifted and curious child as claimed, by the time he was in his 30s - growing up in an area with neighboring Greek towns - is he still illiterate and unaware of Greek philosophy so as to be confused as a philosopher or appeal to the learned?

Just because his preferred audience was the poor and uneducated masses, some of whom went on to continue his ministry, seems a sizable leap to assume he himself never had any curiosity or effort towards broadening his own knowledge before forming and deciding to pass on his original ideas.

It's an assumption with consequences too, as it arguably excessively narrows the scope of what influences may have been at play in the formation of a historical Jesus's thinking to only those from Judaism. While this would be supported with a historical Jesus only creating the *canonical* tradition which falls over itself (particularly in Matthew) in stressing it is solely out of and building on Judaism, it would be a historical Jesus entirely at odds with most of the non-canonical traditions, which draw on a broad swath of ideas ranging from the mysteries to multiple schools of philosophy.

For example, it's often overlooked that Simon Magus, the alleged first 'heretic' contemporary with Peter in Acts who had joined the early church before leaving, in his *Announcement* was talking about an ""indivisible point"" per Hippolytus's *Refutations* volume 6. Was this atomism a Simon Magus original? Because one volume earlier Hippolytus recorded the Naassenes using similar atomist language to describe the 'seeds' making up all things and as originating cause of the universe in their understanding of the mustard seed and sower parable.

That language of 'seeds' as the Epicurean *atomos* is straight out of *De Rerum Natura*, which itself described the origin of the world as being like the scattering of its seeds of things.

The Naassenes are the only group explicitly described as following *Thomas* with its philosopher-like Jesus, a work some scholars claim have versions of both the [mustard seed parable](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas20.html) and [sower parable](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas9.html) in earlier form than the canonical ones. Notably missing the secret explanation for the latter that poorly fits its surrounding context in both Luke and Mark and is at odds with the Johnanine understanding of Jesus as ""saying nothing in secret"" in John 18:20.

But the idea that a historical Jesus might have been engaging with one of the hotly debated arguments in philosophy at the time with language that perhaps went over the heads of some of his audience from whom he was regularly asking that there be people with good ears?

Nah, he was clearly an illiterate peasant, so that's not possible.

Between assuming Simon Magus's brilliance or a historical Jesus's, personally I'd rather assume (in part based on the former joining one of the latter's continued traditions before breaking out on his own) that the guy who ended up central to a multitude of fractal continuations may have had more to him than the average denizen of his given area at that time.",1640906471,"if he were an intellectually gifted and curious child as claimed, by the time he was in his 30s - growing up in an area with neighboring greek towns - is he still illiterate and unaware of greek philosophy so as to be confused as a philosopher or appeal to the learned?","illiterate and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"still illiterate and unaware","illiterate",NA,"still",0

My point is that there are so many resources that are unknown by those who could use them. I don’t believe that’s by coincidence either. As an example, I get people connected to accessibility modifications funded through Medicaid. While very specific, those eligible don’t know about my service because the state doesn’t widely advertise as they should given I operate through a Medicaid waiver. This prevents as many people applying to services therefore decreases expenditure. 

People on SS prior to 26 often times aren’t educated on ABLE accounts, in my opinion, because then they’d have the means to financial independence which would down the line defeat the need for certain services which exists to justify the state’s need for additional Medicaid funding.

"hqcv8gz","Ironically, most of the people who talk about the Dunning Kruger effect online are using it a little bit wrong and misunderstanding what the study actually showed.

The way it's usually described online is that people with no knowledge think they are experts in a subject, and as people gain knowledge in subject their self assessment drops (due to recognizing that they don't know a lot about a subject), and gradually rises as they become experts in said subject.

You see a lot of [graphs like this one] with cute names like ""Mount Stupid"", ""Slope of Enlightenment"" etc.

None of that is really what the initial study indicated, and those graphs do not represent what was found during the study.

Here's a link to the actual study:

- Kruger &amp; Dunning 2000 *[Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12688660_Unskilled_and_Unaware_of_It_How_Difficulties_in_Recognizing_One's_Own_Incompetence_Lead_to_Inflated_Self-Assessments)*.

And here's what the [actual graph shows](https://i2.wp.com/jerz.setonhill.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-2.09.56-PM.png).

In short, what the study found is that, when self assessment of knowledge and competence in a subject are compared with test results in a subject everyone tends to assume that they themselves are somewhere close to the ""average"" level of knowledge and competence.  People with less knowledge do assess themselves lower than experts, but they place themselves much closer to the average than their skill level justifies.  Similarly, experts do rank their own knowledge higher than average, but they also tend to underestimate their own level of knowledge and place themselves closer to the ""average"".

The difference between self assessment and actual competence is greatest in those with little knowledge of a subject, and is easiest for others to see, but in Dunning &amp; Kruger's results it those people didn't place themselves above experts in their self assessment.

Part of the misunderstanding of the results is due to how the authors framed the conclusions:

&gt;In sum, we present this article as an exploration into why people tend to hold overly optimistic and miscalibrated views about themselves. We propose that those with limited knowledge in a domain suffer a dual burden: Not only do they reach mistaken conclusions and make regrettable errors, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it.

"hq0lhy3","Don't overthink these things is my advice - seems like there is pressure to last a long time but that shouldn't be your one and only goal in sex, it is very narrow minded.

During my first sexual experiences I'd usually come very quickly, especially with penetrative sex but this was back in the 90's before internet porn and I was quite innocent and unaware of the ""necessity"" to last a long time and didn't think that way. In fact I had no idea how long sex was ""supposed"" to last.

I clearly remember one of my first sexual experiences - I was just about to put it in but once the tip neared the target, I was so overcome with excitement I blew my load straight away. I didn't feel the need to apologise, I said something along the lines of ""you are so sexy you've made me cum already"".

My girlfriend wasn't disappointed either, she felt good about how she'd made me so turned on. And it wasn't game over at that point, put myself inside her and carried on. It wasn't long before I was cumming again. 

We had some of the best sex I've ever experienced, we just worked with each other to make it great, I'd often start with a good licking and fingering session to get her close and then when I did penetrate, she would would play with her clit to bring herself to orgasm quickly which often resulted in us coming at exactly the same time which felt very special.

It wasn't just me that came quickly, sometimes my girlfriend would orgasm the second I put myself inside after a sexy foot and leg massage.

Only as I got older did I start to read and watch media that suggested sex should be more than just the 2-3 minutes of penetration I'd become accustomed to, but by that time the overexcitement of my youth was starting to wear off and I was lasting longer anyway,

"hq0ifep","Well you should understand this basic concept by now with how much it is discussed on reddit.. but since you appear confused and unaware of this I'll explain: the vaccine reduces the danger of the virus and improves the likelihood of someone not getting nearly as sick as if they were unvaccinated.  It does not prevent people from getting or spreading covid.  In fact, most covid measures are still to protect the unvaccinated more then not.  There is a small percentage for whom the vaccine is less effective and may still get quite sick as well.  

Overall the percentage of patients in hospital has shifted to largely the unvaccinated now.  There is still some vaccinated in hospitals but you are selecting from 81% of the population (the vaccinated percentage of canada) so *some* will be those unlucky few where the vaccine is less effective.

The thing is, while omicron is less dangerous it spreads about 10x faster and to a wider reach.  Current data suggests on average every person who gets omicron will share it with 3 more people.  Consider that only a small percentage of the vaccinated would get covid previously.. and of them only a small percentage would be the  unlucky people where the vaccine was less effective.  Now with omicron a much much larger percentage of people who are vaccinated are getting sick.  This will equally raise of the number of people whom the vaccine is less effective for who will end up in the hospital.",1640515637,"well you should understand this basic concept by now with how much it is discussed on reddit.. but since you appear confused and unaware of this i'll explain: the vaccine reduces the danger of the virus and improves the likelihood of someone not getting nearly as sick as if they were unvaccinated.","confused and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"confused and unaware","confused",NA,NA,0

I’m sure there will be no shortage of these this week but here goes. This morning when my husband and I were opening presents I was so excited to give him his gift (wireless headphones for his two hobbies - running and drumming). He was excited about his gift and I tried not to mind that he printed mine off this morning and put it in the bag of a gift from some friends we had opened yesterday. It was an idea I had given him - a gift card to my local yoga place. He then excitedly put another box in my lap and told me to “open this one next! It’s from my mom!” 

I opened it and immediately said, “oh I think you gave me the wrong box, this must be for you.” Inside was a recipe book of gluten free cooking. Here’s the thing - I am not gluten free. He is. I looked at him confused and he, still happy and unaware of the shit storm of emotions about to rain upon him, told me he that he suggested this gift to his mom. I was incredulous, and let him know that this was a gift for him, not for me. This is basically like giving a mom a vacuum for Christmas - here’s a gift so that you can serve me! 

I promptly burst into tears and we had a fight about this gift and then Christmas in general. We’ve both been miffed all day, and he thinks I should see that “it’s a gift for both of us” because I like to cook and bake. AITA?

"hpwkstk","&gt; What I am arguing, is an exploration of the circumstances of how harems can work out, and what needs to be done to make it work out, which does not work out in real life.

Your way of arguing is deeply flawed. You are arguing from your desired conclusion backwards, which lacks substantiation on your part. You have to work your way up to your conclusion.

You basically say ""well it just works, cuz it's fiction"".  No, it doesn't ""just work"", otherwise its completely pointless argument. It works cuz author says it works and its all perfect and fine, but it's not. There are clear contradictions.   

No it's not possible even in fiction , unless he splits himself in equal number of selves like Dr. Manhattan.

Youre just saying  ""well it's compensated"" , NO IT'S NOT. You are just willing to easily believe that it can be compensated with completely different things, material values, by being strong or whatnot. You cant compensate romantic relationship with that, you can only equalize it with an equivalent thing.   

Your compensation is equivalent to money, making the girl similar to glorified whore. Just because buying a whore is mutual agreement, doesn't mean there is any balance.  These are incomparable things, equivalent exchange is impossible.

It is only fair and balanced in your mind under your own unfair rules, that are different for women, because of your fantasy, not even the author's fantasy, but yours and how you have interpreted it and accepted how author has framed it.  

&gt; they will backstab each other. Make each others' children hate each other. Push responsibilities between each other to make more time to spend with the guy. Gossip about each other and make each other look bad in front of the guy.

And you just accept that it's just never gonna happen in your fantasy, because you dont want to, whitewashing the human nature, dehumanizing and infantilizing the women of fantasy harem.

You might aswell make them sex robots in your fantasy.

You can't assume ""it will be fair cuz it's fiction"", because what is fair is what i decide as a reader , and what happens is decided by the author and i can say ""that's not actually fair, and author subconsciously favoured and treated Roxy much better"" . 

&gt;The power keg does not rest with the guy, it rests with the girls now, and they can just move that relationship if they want to. 

that's wrong and untrue, again just your fantasy. Because that would be contradiction to harem premises. Girls are so devoted that they'll take any chance to have more time with the guy. And since guy's attention is split, they'll do anything not to upset the guy or let him lose interest.  

You also INCORRECTLY and unjustifiably just treat girls as group, as if they are expected to form organization. Complete fabrication of your mind, that's not even how the authors see them.    

They are all individuals, that all have less rights and power than the man, they have less of pretty much everything.


&gt; how is it a benefit when you have to do so for multiple people? Which is where I pointed out, it tilts in the favour of the women

This is disingenuous , because in reality men enjoy harems, it's a popular sexual wishfulfilment fantasy. So it's in guy's favour always, it's what he wants, what the audience wants. Youre just making up something to misrepresent the whole point of the harem in fiction, it's a contradiction.   

If harem was an undesirable burden, the author wouldnt write that kind of fantasy, and the genre wouldnt exist.  

&gt;Rudeus would have to make sure they do have their romantic needs met

Youre not critically thinking about this. Your whole premise is unfairly stacked for the man, youre assuming that woman's romantic needs ARE LESSER than mans. If romantic needs of women was equal to Rudy's, then they'd be getting 1/3rd of what Rudy gets, therefore their needs wouldnt be fully met at all.  

Or their needs would have to be lesser, lesser sex drive, lesser desire. Can you not see all these contradictions? But if their needs are lesser, then why would they be so into the guy that they'd go for a harem?  It's dumb and illogical.  

&gt;and if Rudeus were not to have made sure it is at least a fair one (which is difficult), the harem would not have formed.

You just continue to argue from your conclusions. It's logically fallacious to say ""it's fair because harem would not have formed if it was unfair"" , it's not at all established.  

The harems form in all harem stories in any way author wants, they are all unfair by default.   

So my counter argument that is equally valid, but much better substantiated is that  - It's unfair, because it is harem. If relationship was fair, it wouldnt be a harem at all . 

&gt;tilt towards the women

Any women that desires what the man gets, in the amount of romantic interaction and sexual relationship and intimacy, would want to find another guy and be able to have multiple partners.  

THE ONLY way a guy can give as much as he receives is if he splits himself like Dr. Manhattan. That's how you can do it in fiction. So it's impossible even in fiction for harem protag to meet needs of someone who has same needs as him, if he needs to split his attention, time etc.   

You're arguing something completely illogical and unaware of contradictions.

Everything about this is unfair, distorted and imbalanced and nothing can compensate it.

So yeah, if you want to think about how harems ""could"" work in fiction, your fiction needs to make girls much lesser people in almost every aspect than the guy, with lesser needs and demands, more easily satisfied, infantilized and aspects of normal human element removed (lobotomized).     
But then you have to realize that such a setup, and such conditions are by themselves extremely unfair and against women, as the women aren't allowed the human traits and behaviours that the guy can have, they can therefore also never be equal to the guy , not even close.    

Such women are no better than pokemon, reduced to mere animals or robots, trophies.   
I'd argue that fiction should aim for the relationships to be between complete humans, but in your scenario the women aren't and only the protag is allowed to be complete human.

"hptlb0o","You are free to think that, but there is ample evidence that God LOVES children.

&gt; 3 And he said: ""Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 18:3 NIV)

&gt; 13 Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. 14 Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, **for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these**."" (Matt. 19:13-14 NIV)

&gt; 37 ""Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."" (Mark 9:37 NIV)

There's more, but it's obvious that, as the song says, ""Jesus loves the little children...""

"hpqrf9m","To me the **worst** thing was the way they changed Goku's personality, he was made to be very stupid and unaware of things/ extremely naive like.

I mean goku was never ever stupid, in the beginning stages of the franchise, Goku was just a bit naive and lacked knowledge about the world simply because he grew up in the mountains and didn't interact with the outside world aside from his grandpa, his character developed overtime and in Z he became a serious grown up man, then suddenly in super he was made extremely over the top silly and naive. specially in the Zamasu/black arc. there are many moments that were so frustrating I was actually annoyed by his behavior because it's over the top unlike Z Goku. 

I don't know if the writer thought that would be amusing to see but it is definitely not.


My other issues was weak writings in some areas, or things that don't make sense. for example in the frieza return arc they implied that golden frieza was potentially stronger than SSB which should've never been the case, also Frieza should not be able to sense Goku's Ki when he is in blue or regular god. 4 months of training and hes stronger than blue? complete nonsense reasoning, either have a better background story or don't make up weak reasoning for things.

There are other issues like this but I don't think I need to mention them because most people are either aware or if this gets too long no one will read it anyway.

If a big box has to expand their footprint to have space for games in glass display cases, or Plexi sealed cases, they increase the departmental footprint during the next reset.  It doesn't cost them anything but space in another department.

If a small boutique retailer like GameStop has to do the same, they have to increase their overall store size for all of their nearly 5000 stores which means a considerable increase in their lease expenses.  That's to say nothing of the fact that each retailer you listed has dedicated on site loss prevention staff which GS does not.

Edison and all his buddies made a concerted effort to shit all over his work and discredit him so they could take his ideas and develop them into the energy industry we know today. Big bucks for them. Imagine what we could do if we didn't have energy bills? 
And also through that unification Tesla was chasing, service to others rather than service to self, it would make possibilities for humanity truely infinite.

Instead, those Edisons are still around today making sure we all stay dumb and unaware of possibility, maintain their profits and keep giving our hard earned money to them. 

I go commando these days so nothing surprises me lol but it's our planet, our species, Earth deserves better than what it's been given and same for the people. My death won't change that.

"hpankkh","Try to stick with data that has legit sources. There are a lot of areas where ""we don't know"" is more appropriate that any absolute known.

What are you trying to convey? There is so much to it, it's hard to focus on one thing. I would try to have a simplified approach, maybe three points, then build on each of those. Also a good idea to not get too extreme, an example being: rather than say masks are useless and ineffective, you say that there are not many scenarios where masks will prevent infection. They are only being recommended to prevent direct transmission of droplets [directly] from mouth or nose to another person's eyes, nose, mouth hands, clothing, etc. They have no other purpose. But.. If the wearer is not infected, it does nothing. If the wearer is infected, but asymptomatic and unaware of infection, this is the only use-case, and it only applies to direct transmission within 6 feet. If a person is aware of their infection, they are advised to stay home and isolate/quarantine, masks are no longer recommended. Viruses are much smaller than most masks can filter. Water vapor is aerosolized through the mask, and will also take the path of least resistance (i.e. *around* the mask or via gaps). Even when a mask is tightly fitted to one's face, a person can still fog up their glasses (water vapor) through the mask. This is an airborne virus, so the direct transmission via ""droplets"" prevention is not going to reduce spread by *much*.",1640009204,"if the wearer is infected, but asymptomatic and unaware of infection, this is the only use-case, and it only applies to direct transmission within 6 feet.","asymptomatic and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asymptomatic and unaware","asymptomatic",NA,NA,0

"hoy2bgc","&gt;This is not consistent. When you are telling a person they hold racist beliefs - which by the way is semantically equivalent to being called a racist - and that they have biases, you are attacking those people. It's ingrained in much of Western culture by now that being a racist makes you a bad person. You are calling them bad people. You might be saying it's not their fault that they are bad, or that everyone is bad, but you are still saying they are bad.
  

  
They are not being led to believe they are under attack, they believe they are under attack because they are under attack.

There's a significant distinction between being uncritical and unaware of a bias, and acting on a bias with the intention to cause harm. A bigot does the latter, but almost everyone has the former to some degree. That's what the theory of implicit bias is. 

Applying the label of *bad person* to literally everyone on earth who has ever believed something racist that their parents, school system or media has told them makes the distinction absolutely meaningless, which is why that's explicitly not what I'm saying someone is bad for just having biases. That applies equally to myself as it does anyone else here. I don't claim to be above it.

I'm just not attacking you when I say this, because it's not a statement about the individual, but about society and culture at large. Most people who hold progressive values aren't attacking you when they say this.

People's defensiveness about this issue is the direct product of lifetimes of being told they're under attack, that their character is being spit on, that they're going to be replaced, when the reality is fuck-all of that is happening. It's manufactured for the express purpose of getting more people on board with generating outrage against the mere *mention* of these topics, because even if 80% of the responses to these controversies aren't coming from outright bigots, a lot of the talking points are being crafted by them.

If nothing else you obviously have tremendous amounts of resolve. It's commendable that you still have the presence of mind to seek inner peace without losing sight of your long term goals. That's a really tough balancing act.

Honestly, you've got very little reason to trust anyone. It sounds like nobody has yet treated you well, except perhaps your husband. But even his needs are met before yours. And like your mother, he won't go for the treatment that he needs. That's got to be so difficult for you. 

Your statement, ""I just want to enjoy doing something in the company of a similar minded person"" really resonates with me. It's very well said actually. I too would be much more willing to socialize if I could find someone trustworthy with whom to share a few simple, common pleasures. Alas, that's not on the horizon. Unlike you though, I've got no excuses like that I've got too much else going on. 

I also have had similar issues with doctors, albeit not because I'm young or attractive, just unusual. One of my conditions is so rare, I'm always the first patient with it that new health care workers have met. Doctors in residency always say, ""Oh, we've only read about that in school!""

I get how your parents have failed you though. Not taking the time to explain things well enough for you to be able to let them sink in, putting too much emphasis on rather inconsequential issues and not on more important matters, abandonment, your mom choosing a relationship with her addiction over one with you, being told to shut up, shady friends, shady opinions of your friends, lack of guidance, lack of role modeling, lack of support, etc, these all take their toll. Damn heavy, as you said. One thing I think it would be wise to let go of are your expectations that they'll ever do right by you. Accepting that you are taking over the role of parent to your inner children can be a powerful step. It represents another level of maturity.

Guess i'm just built different"". That's just not how people work. You won't be aware you're wrong. Every human being thinks that's how they act. Socialists think their policy is evidence based. Fascists think they're evidence based. Everyone thinks they are evidence based. It seems to me more reliable to instead develop a way of thinking that minimizes your chance of being wrong, and maximizes the chance that when you're wrong and unaware of it, you'll be wrong in a forgivable way, and I take the view that using ""maximize as many people's power over their own destiny as possible"" as your compass is probably the best way to do that. What do I believe? I believe whatever will maximize the number of people and maximize the extent to which those people can control their own fate.

"hongmfl","I stayed for about three years after I realized it wasn’t going to work two months into the relationship.

I had no self esteem, she convinced me that no one would ever love me like she did, and that she was my last chance at love because I was too broken.

I thought she was “the one” for one and a half of the years we were together, and that’s part of why I forced myself to stay (“if she’s the one, then the reason I’m not enjoying this relationship is because there’s something wrong with me, not her”). In the last year and a bit I knew she wasn’t but I didn’t feel like I could get out for a laundry list of reasons. Primarily being afraid of never finding love again, that she threatened to kill herself if I left, sunk cost fallacy, thinking I was her only way out of an abusive family situation I later found out was a lie to keep me with her.

I was 14 when we met, 15 when we got together, and 19 when we split. She was 25 when we split up.

We broke up because I met someone else. I’m not proud of having an emotional affair while I was still dating her with a man who was in a similar situation with his girlfriend. It felt like we were the only people who understood what we were going through. It only lasted a few months before I left my ex- but he gave me the strength to realize that I was still lovable and that I deserved better. She threatened to kill me when she found out, but funnily that’s not why I left. I left because she started directing her anger and violence towards my best friend because she was mad at me, a woman who was completely uninvolved and unaware of the affair and was nothing but the perfect, sweetest best friend to us both. I knew she didn’t deserve that, and then the guy I was talking to who had left his girlfriend after I convinced him he deserved better asked me why I thought I deserved it if neither he or my best friend did?

So I left. I don’t miss her, I miss the four years of my life I gave her. She taught me to grow a backbone early, that people will manipulate you if given the opportunity, and how to identify potential manipulation early, that life’s too short to be in a relationship that doesn’t make you happy. It also taught me that abusive and bad relationships are like quicksand, you don’t realize how bad they are until you’re almost in over your head.

Richard: pro-calm and personable, con-authoritarian

Luke: pro-he cares a lot of Lorelai and Rory, con-doesn't take risks and bad communicator

Lane (love her): pro-funny and her relationship with Ms Kim is the best written relationship on the show in general in my opinion, con-she's kind of impulsive (such as getting drunk in Keg! Max! or running away from home to live with Rory in Yale)

Sookie: pro-she's a great friend and has an overall warm aura, con-she's unrealistic (I guess this is meant to be by ASP as she is supposed to be this ultra creative person but I feel like that's stereotyping by ASP bc it assumes you can't be rational and creative at the same time)

Paris (love her too): pro-witty and driven, con-kinda crude and extremely condescending sometimes

I think most of the rest of the characters are extremely one dimensional as I said about Madeline and Louise, but for example Dean is seen as this perfect boyfriend to Rory with absolutely no flaws in the first two seasons.

"hnt6ybm","Again, you’re assuming these people hid from law enforcement Bc that’s what the media told us. Did you watch their arraignment? Bc I did. Did you watch watch the Crumbley’s lawyers said. Bc I did. Their lawyers had called the prosecuted on this case and the status of the possible charges numerous times; they even text her. The prosecutor REFUSED to respond back to the lawyers and instead decided to publicly announce the charges at a press conference. The first time both the lawyers and the Crumbley’s were aware they needed to appear before a judge was at a press conference! Never have parents in a school shooting been charged for the horrific crime their child decided to act upon. Never. THIS case is the first case. In the press conference, the prosecutor literally states “I want to make an example out of these parents”. The entire case is already politically motivated on gun control. It’s clear as day. They didn’t make their case with Rittenhouse, so this is the next one to present itself. Don’t you see ? I think what makes the parents even more innocent and unaware of this whole thing and Ethan’s plan is the fact that they were at the school THAT morning. The school actually knew more information than the parents, as students had expressed and shared their concerns of a possible school shooting. Did the teachers tell the parents this tidbit? We have no idea. All we know is that Ethan’s parents were made aware of the note he made, which in the eyes of a parent, looks like a desperate cry for help against suicidal thoughts. A parent would not have looked at that note and thought “oh shit, my kid wants to shoot up the school”. No parent would ever think that their kid is capable of that! I don’t think there is a parent in the world who would ever think their kid would commit such a horrific massacre like a school shooting. I truly don’t. So in the timeline of events: you have a teacher seeing the note. The parents being called in to come to the school. Them meeting with Ethan in the office to discuss the meaning behind it and whether or not he should go home. The school believed Ethan when he said it was in reference to a video game. Ethan goes back to class rather than home. Shoots up the school an hour later. The shooting goes live on national television. Mr. Crumbley, having just been at the school Bc of Ethan’s disturbing behavior, goes to check his newly purchased gun. It’s not there. He calls the school. Ethan’s mom, having just seen that note earlier, texts her son “don’t do it” because she means “don’t kill yourself”. That’s what his mother meant. It’s beyond obvious. She’s his mom and that’s her little boy. Any mom would immediately think he was going to hurt himself after everything that occurred that morning. She was thinking about him. She prob had no idea the damage he had done and the lives he ruined. Idk. The school should have searched him.

"hnpluzq","&gt;Dr. Whaley told The Times that the data was collected between 2014 and 2019 but the pay gap is probably bigger now because of the pandemic as *more women had to look after children and stay at home.*

Had to? Or wanted to?

I don't doubt that there's women who's been ""forced"" or pressured to stay at home to look after the children, but why is that? 

I'd assume it has to do with the fact that mother's has chosen lower paid jobs than the father's, and so logically, to provide the most for the family, the best decision is for the mother to stay at home and the father to keep working.

So what can be done to prevent this?

*Women can choose to study and get into well paid work that can provide for a family just like a lot of men do.* That way, if the man in the relationship earns less, it would make sense that he'd stay at home to look after the children too, or if they both have high paying jobs, that they either split the SAHP role or pay for childcare.

All in all it comes down to the fact that women *choose* lower paid work, and then they *choose* to get pregnant or *choose* to stay pregnant and often *choose* to work less if given the opportunity, which obviously means they're indirectly choosing to earn less though they may not realize it before it's too late and they're stuck in the SAHM role complaining how they earn less and have to look after the children, when *their own choices* led to such consequences. 

Then they complain that the consequences are unfair, but no shit things aren't equal when you make different choices that lead to different outcomes. No shit.

And what troubles me is how little self awareness and self introspection and reflection a lot of feminists have, cause it is troubling for women collectively that they aren't told they're responsible for their own decisions. It is problematic that feminists infantilize women and make them look so weak, stupid, unintelligent and unaware of the consequences of their actions to the point where they shouldn't even be held accountable or responsible for them.

Now, what can we do to change this?

I guess telling women that if they want to earn a lot, they need to *choose well paid work*, and they need to work hard at ot. (Not choose lower paid work and work part time and complain they're less paid).

Also, we need to tell women that they either should 1. *Choose* partners who are willing and enthusiastic about being a SAHP. 2. *Choose* to be childfree, as not having children means women can choose to focus entirely on their career and earning well.

All in all it boils down to choice. If you don't like the consequences that certain choices come with, simply don't make the choice.

And yes, there's social influences that push us into different roles and directions, but we are ultimately still free to choose what role and direction we want to take in life.

That's my speech as a woman who got banned from that sub and can't speak my words there. I just think it's more empowering to preach that women have a choice and that they should make educated intelligent choices (like choosing work more based on pay and choose partners who wants to and agree to co parent equally), rather than preach that women need compensation for making poor choices that has consequences they don't like.",1638967323,"it is problematic that feminists infantilize women and make them look so weak, stupid, unintelligent and unaware of the consequences of their actions to the point where they shouldn't even be held accountable or responsible for them.","unintelligent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unintelligent and unaware","unintelligent",NA,NA,0
"hnp5fzc","My take, and I'm not saying this is right just how I saw it, the first guy that was killed by the reaper looking demon was killed in the same way as the wife at the end so I assumed it was her who had killed him.

After the final segment I took those two mens story to be that they were taking revenge for the guy who got stuck in the motel room's daughter being murdered.

Either by the husband or both the husband and the wife, the guy killed by the reaper demon in the beginning whispers something to the wife before he chokes her to death with the towel. That's a nasty way to kill someone and it suggested to me that both the husband and the wife were involved in the little girls murder.


I think that because the reaper demons didn't come after them until they had killed the couples daughter that she was innocent, that they were being punished for killing her not her parents.

Because of this and because they were murdered by the little girls father, his punishment was to be locked into the motel room with her but only see fleeting glimpses of her and never be able to catch up to her or hold her.
We can see how quickly that torment starts to effect him and how much pain it causes him.

I don't have any explanation about the loop on the highway that they can't escape, but the characters have no idea what's happening either, again my assumption is they have been living in that post apocalyptic world for a while but that was as new and fucked up to them as it was to anyone watching.

Uhhhh are you new here? Alien brand new off the mother ship? Or just that clueless? This has been the case for well over a century. 

Like I can't stress hard enough how grossly you're missing the point here. The point isn't how many still are queerphobic the point is how many *no longer are*.  

Republicans being Republicans is nothing new or noteworthy they've been doing that since before they became explicitly fascist and didn't stop progress much. 

Rowling and Dawkins likewise are pretty old news. Yes they're still bad and everything but they've been known quantities for quote some time now. 

Media reports have, once again, always done that, for a very very very long time. You are, once again, grossly missing the point which is how many *aren't* doing that anymore not who still is. 

Hate crimes rising is in tandem with rising far right fascism in the west. While LGBTQIA is a small part of that reactionary vitriol, general decay of material conditions unrelated to our existence are the actual starting catalyst.

I can't speak for Europe, but the other poster ought familiarize more with the demography of the States to add nuance to that claim. In the US the younger two generations are *extremely* progressive. And more resilient to the rising fascism that might have a better foothold in Europe due to diversity. Gen Z in the US is the first generation that's *not majority white* and where studies estimate anything from the midteens at worst to 1 in 3 are LGBTQIA. 

Needless to say, whole young fascists here do exist, they're all white a cishet, and are themselves a minority. 

The major concern for America is that the older 2 more fascist generations exit to the next world, there's still a little time for them potentially to pull the rug out. 2024 is their best bet for this and it is a very real risk, 2028 would be a total hail marry due to the deaths of older voters and coming of age of younger progressives. 

""Fun"" fact: the average age of extremists in the US (we only have right wing ones really) is 42. This is notable because everywhere else in the world, the average age of extremist groups is 20s to early 30s. Food for thought.

"hno8dwp","I want to sit down with Zimmer, Can Danztler, and Xavier Woods and just have a film session over that last play. Somebody is fucking lying and not owning up, because there’s no excuse for any combo of player and or coach after the middle school level to call a timeout, strategize about what the most obvious play(s) they’re about to see given the situation, and what to do versus what not to do. I get that Woods was technically supposed to crash down for the underneath route, but then WHY IN THE HELL was he positioned so deep and over? Every NFL team has NFL caliber athletes and that short route isn’t some long developing play. A super quick sprint and any receiver in the league will be right there at the line and all they need to do is simply catch the ball and they win. Woods was positioned as if the endzone started 5-6 yards deep within the actual endzone and was still in some prevent mode keeping things in front of him. Dantzler was 4 yards too deep and still started backpedaling off the snap with his body positioned in such a way that he made it almost impossible to redirect back in towards his man incase the guy ran anything but a fade into the back of the endzone. I played receiver in college and in the three years in which I started, any time a corner and safety were too deep within the redzone, we’d try to expose that almost 100% of the time. If the defense is playing on their heels and giving you the front 3 yards of the endzone, those short routes with a catch in stride get in there a lot. There’s no excuse for their depth of positioning, given what the Lions were presenting. 

I simply cannot believe that a NFL caliber DB and S were so damn clueless, slow, and unaware of one of the most basic situations in the game. They genuinely played as if Zimmer told them to do everything in their power to prevent Detroit from scoring in the back 2-3 yards of the endzone.",1638931817,"i simply cannot believe that a nfl caliber db and s were so damn clueless, slow, and unaware of one of the most basic situations in the game.","slow, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"slow , and unaware","slow",NA,NA,0

Replacing your income by monetizing your skillsets is not automatically the same thing as building a following you then direct to a funnel, as mentioned. Producing is a type of job, you can make money in any professional industry, if you are a professional. 

The fact you say you've been doing this so long and it's not hard to make a full time income with...I mean dude I'm sorry you seem to be very much so naïve and stuck and unaware of what you're saying.   


If you want to be a beat maker on youtube and direct to a website, all the power to you. I hope you get there. Seems like you're confident you will. If you want to make a full time income as a producer, in my opinion, you haven't even taken a single step in this direction.   


Ill Factor of Beat Academy has a wall of Gold records behind him. Not a single one of his 100k followers helped him do that, and there was not a single follower or fan that had anything to do with how many sales and streams he's responsible for.   


The people making the most money are nameless and not on social media. It's the difference between being Shaq, and the guy who writes Shaq's check. It's difference between being Adele, and producing for her alongside 12 other major artists. It's the difference between being Mary Lambert, and the person writing her hit songs, or producing them, or managing them, or marketing them.

"hnjk75b","Yeah that's quite a tricky situation if your mom's that nosy... Perhaps to ease the impact of the question, you can sugarcoat it by asking your dad if he feels comfortable enough seeing a therapist /with/ you, just to have a sort of "" mediator"" help you both work on your relationship and ask for advice on what you could both improve?  ( Finding ways to communicate better, how to avoid heated misunderstandings, what subjects to avoid, how to be more emotionally mature, practicing communicating how everyone feels, understanding the value of emotions/feelings and why it's important to consider them, etc.) So you both need someone else to meditate, help, and suggest you stuff, but a therapist is the only person who can help. 

And try to avoid having your mom involved for the time being yeah, that might be too many people and if your therapist isn't great, it can risk getting ugly if no one wants to listen to your perspective. You can try to pick the therapist of your preference, even online perhaps, if you can.  Some online therapies can pair you with therapists with similar values as you that you can pick. As for irl, some therapists sometimes write a bio which might help you get a feel for what the person might be like.
 
I'm not sure if it's narcissism or not since I'm no expert and covert narcissists are tricky to spot. But if it helps, from what I understand everyone is on a sort of scale when it comes to exhibiting some narcissistic traits; on one side most people show a healthy amount of egoism, and in some rare cases some have full blown NPD or other various personality disorders when the traits start being severe and destructive. Most of the time, except the extreme cases, the narcissistic traits can still be tinkered with. I'm hoping that he's just simply aloof and unaware of his total apathy towards other people's feelings and his own, since there might be a chance to still sort of have some level of communication with him that could hopefully improve with time. 
People with narcissistic personality disorder are usually impossible to get through to, since their real sense and understanding of themselves and others is shattered and replaced by one big angry defensive armor. If he's just alexithymic and confused, he might still be able to learn to understand the value of well, emotions, by practicing them. It could be wishful thinking, but it might be worth a try if he wants to put in the effort.
 If he refuses, then try to make it clear that you can't work this out alone by yourself, since neither of you have the ressources or are fit to take control of the situation since nothing that you've tried has worked so far. And because of that, you can't make any progress if you aren't on the same page, and someone can help with that.

"hniv5v7","The only reason i know anything about attachment theory is because my breakup from a DA was so disruptive for me. Unlike any other relationship or situation I have ever been in. I was really and truly happy before i met them, i was looking forward to sharing my happiness with a partner. I was dating on a regular all that year and thought i found a person i could settle into a long term with. 

I am secure, in my late 30's  


So here are the things i discovered and figured out. 

1. The relationship was fundamentally sound at the beginning, no drama no fights. This is because the DA is really just doing things they know to be expected of them in the early stages. I'm not sure if its that they are faking? Or is it just they are trying really hard to give normal relationship development a solid go.
2. If you are secure and unaware of attachment theory, everything about a DA that happens when they are triggered is utterly confusing and nonsensical in terms of how relationships and people normally handle situations. 
3. If you are able to solve the problems that avoidant brings to you, it won't matter. New problems will spring up and even if they are small.....it will be used as justification.
4. I have never dealt with someone so stubborn and against seeing things from the side of the other person. What tends to cause the deepest wounds is the lack of sympathy and understanding of the emotions the other person has. 
5. The abrupt ending, for no fault of your own that you can see, is devastating.  That produces the most unanswered questions. Did they ever like me? When i made love to them, did that even mean anything? How could you see me in love and let me walk right off that cliff, knowing you would never catch me. Did i fall in love with a ghost? A person who was really not who i thought they were. If they could fool me, can't anyone else? How could i be so silly to think they were developing feelings for me too?
6. The vilification from the idea of ""i'm good, you are bad"" mindset can be super subtle.
7. The will not introspect, even while admitting the point about our relationship made sense. She never internalized that maybe she was making big deals from nothing and sabotaging our relationship. 
8. The hot cold ended me. Like, we decided to keep giving it a try and we started dating again. It was like a switch flipped, she was texting me in the morning again. She went out of her way to be sexual towards me. We had a great dinner date. Then two weeks later, she cut me off again. I thought that we really shared some good moments, but once again it made me question reality. 
9. I did all the work. Hundreds of dollars for dates and travel, letting go of other potential partners. Stuck with therapy bills, stuck on antidepression meds. I got nothing to show for it. I don't even have ""good times"" memories cause i question if i'm the only one who even felt that way. 
10. It gets better, but i don't even look forward to being attracted to women anymore. I'm like so content just not even caring that a relationship might be years in the future.",1638833180,"if you are secure and unaware of attachment theory, everything about a da that happens when they are triggered is utterly confusing and nonsensical in terms of how relationships and people normally handle situations.","secure and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"secure and unaware","secure",NA,NA,0

As I strengthened, I was better able to love and accept that others do not think as I think.  Slowly, I became better at honoring ""their"" experience and perspective as a valuable instance of the infinite.  

I'd also encourage you to not judge yourself for reacting as you reacted, even when acting bitterly sarcastic.  This reaction is a way of rejecting what doesn't align to affirm what does.  As you strengthen, if you orient towards the positive polarity of non-judgement and love, then it will be easier to interact with those who are still asleep with feeling the need to judge or condemn them.  After all, most of us were asleep not too long ago and I would not wish to be judged by those who I sought to emulate.",1638721059,"in time, it's easier to be gentle and loving to those who are still asleep and unaware of our true nature.","asleep and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asleep and unaware","asleep",NA,NA,0
"hnbgane","Thank you OP for such detailed write up. Pardon me if I am posting this question at the wrong place. Just wondering if anyone here had any experience on what can be done if the victim had fallen into some cryptocurrency scam? 

Not very sure which category this kind of scam falls into, love scam or investment scam? Perhaps both? Victim thinks scammer is her boyfriend, scammer through fake cryptocurrency investment platform makes victim thinks they have a joint investment account and had been buying and selling non-existent cryptocurrency for months. All transaction were made through instant transfer, outside the so called investment application installed. The applications were all downloaded through web browser outside of App Store. Victim was not very tech savvy and unaware of the source she is downloading an application from.

This happened like almost 3 or 4 months ago, tried calling bank and also BNM but all of them said there’s nothing much can be done? Just curious if it’s true that nothing can really be done?

Sure some teachers are assholes. It would be dishonest on my part to imply there arent any. But to say someone willing to dedicate their career to and go through a costly education to handle someone else's kids while underpaid for the sake of the powertrip alone is kinda ridiculous.

Power imbalances exist everywhere. But there are certain lines that adults are expected to never cross that children are exempt from. Children do not respect their teachers because they can plainly see that their parents don't respect their teachers and the school administrators don't respect their teachers. This whole past year parents have been braying for teachers to be brought back to babysit their bad kids with no regard for their health. And even before this admin always undermined teachers to appease parents and cover their own asses. Parents have abidcated the responsibility of raising their kids and tossed on teachers to do it 20 at a time 8 hours out of the day. And the iPad does the rest at home.

"hn2eqm4","Ehasz wanted that. Pretty sure Mike and Brian said that was never their intention. I don't get how Mai and Ty Lee betraying her shows there's still hope for her. Sure she has a mental breakdown over her friends betraying her. But her friends weren't maliciously backstabbing her, they were standing up to her abuse. Her mental breakdown is from her worldview of it's better to be feared than loved being shattered. The more justifiable example could be Ozai leaving her in the Fire Nation during the comet. She feels betrayed by the person she trusted most and probably felt the most comfortable with because he understood and admired her when so many feared her. But she's finally seeing that her view of everyone else as a tool is the same as her father's. She has been told she's so special but when it comes down to it she's a pawn to him. At the end she doesn't curse her father for leaving her behind, or recognize that she pushed away all those who loved her due to her lack of empathy. She grows deeper in her hate for Zuko and her mother. She deflects and justifies everything to hold onto that worldview. In real life that's pretty on par for her type of mental health issues. We like to think everyone is introspective and willing to admit fault but that's actually not everyone's default. Especially someone like Azula.

I get having empathy for Azula, I understand that she is a victim, and I also understand she is a child. You can like Azula but I get kind of tired of the rosy colored glasses for her. She's incredibly sadistic, manipulative and abusive. She shows no signs of that changing those things or having remorse for them. If at the end of season 3 she showed that being used by Ozai during the comet made her realize how bad it felt to her friends and Zuko to be used by her, then I could see some possibilities. But she doesn't. Her being 14 doesn't change that. Being a bit selfish and unaware of others can be a simple life experience fix. Sadistic and manipulative tendencies aren't that simple. There are plenty of people in real life who do really horrible things and never even see them as wrong, even in the face of enormous consequences. It is not out of the realm of possibility for Azula to follow this path.

"hmv2p9j","I’m 28.

 Four, and none of them necessarily healthy or done “right”. A lot of codependency. 

First one, I was 17 and he was 25 (yeah I know). First real relationship and an Absolutely horrible one, was living together by 18, I dropped out of university in my second year despite having a full scholarship, was on horrible grounds with my parents. Took until 20 and moving cities to leave him for good. Took until 24 or 25 to truly reconnect with my parents. Still have residual trauma and weird assumptions/defence mechanisms when I start seeing someone new because of this guy. 

Second one started around 21. I was a mess from the first one and had seen/dated/slept around a ton in between. We met as roommates when I moved in via a mutual friend, so were living together from the start. That one lasted 3.5 years. He was really sweet and supportive (and PATIENT goodness, I put him through a lot after how I became from the first one) but my standards were unreasonably low and I knew we wouldn’t be compatible long term.

Next was also 3 years and a few months. Started around 25 years old. Again, had a couple less serious relationships or hookups in between. Broke up with him in May but knew we weren’t compatible for like a year before I pulled the plug. Again, lovely person, but we ended up long-distance and neither of us wanted to move or compromise. I grew a lot with him though, got back into school, moved to Vancouver and am grateful for everything. Still feel guilt for leaving him and think about that often.

So that was May.

Met the next one in June after a few other tinder dates. Didn’t mean to get into something serious, was looking to enjoy some single time to grow but we clicked. We’ve been dating 5 months. He’s from India and I’m Canadian - he’s living here now as an international student w the intention of permanent residency. His post-degree diploma ends in December then he’ll apply for his work permit. I’m sure you can imagine the complications. His family knows he has a Canadian girlfriend and tolerate it but don’t support it. My family thinks he’s trying to get a free pass into Canada (yes they are racist and unaware of just how racist they are, in multiple other ways as well). But he has been good for me so far. He actually makes me TALK about things and face my residual trauma-related behaviours, which has been tough but so good.

So, four serious relationships.

"hmedqi5","You keep coming up with more and more straw man arguments. The shit this man listed on his post isn’t safe and healthy and it most definitely comes from a place of wanting to degrade and hurt women. You can’t even pretend it’s healthy or not harmful and even though you’re trying to manipulate people into supporting this crap, i’m sure you’re completely aware this stuff is degrading and harmful to women.

It’s not that hard to understand, I think less of people who hit others but i’m not gonna think less of someone solely because their partner hits them. The action of hitting your partner vs receiving an action both come from different places, there’s no reason why I should view them as the same except maybe to make people like you feel more comfortable.

If someone idea of being a “switch” involves being violent to their partner, I don’t respect their actions either. Not sure what you don’t understand. In a situation where someone is beating or degrading another, they are responsible for their own action, they decided to do it.

I know women consume pornography although it is not at roughly equal rates and it’s also fairly recent that more women started consuming porn. I never stated it was just for men, most of it is designed for men though, and made by men who know what other men want to see.

I never mentioned coal-miners specifically this is just you choosing to only bring up one specific example despite there being loads of forms of manual labour. Regardless, coal miners don’t get beaten and degraded on camera as some porn stars do, nor do they have their insides exposed to other people’s bodily fluids so it’s not gonna be an equivalent to what porn stars go through even if you think it’s worse. It is not the same thing.

Someone can choose to become a porn star (many people who do are young and unaware of the reality of the industry) and still be a victim of something that was done to them on set. Many porn videos are not fully consensual, people are pressured to do stuff when they don’t want to too. Also, some manual labour jobs are not available for everyone, many people wouldn’t be able to physically do them yet can still do porn so I’m not sure why you think this is a good argument.

Most women who are porn starts are not earning a lot of money, porn is also a lot more than just undressing for camera. You seem like you watch it so surely you know that. Reading the types of porn this man listed in his post and reducing it to  having to “undress for camera” is disingenuous. You know damn well most porn actors are being on the receiving end of acts (such as ones listed by op), not just undressing.

You’re not gonna get anywhere by trying to convince me men who get off on hitting women fully respect them. Sound more like you’re tryna convince yourself at this point. I used to be someone who supported bdsm and all this crap, I know why I changed my mind and i’m not going back to supporting it at all.

I never used the word “villain” lmfao. The word misogynist is enough. If you enjoy calling women misogynistic slurs, yes you’re a misogynist. Why should I have to act delusional and wear down on my own conscience as well as literal common sense for the sake of making men who call women misogynistic slurs feel better about theirselves? I’m gonna keep believing men who enjoy misogyny are misogynists, get over it. 

It’s actually laughable that you think the “comforting lie” is me believing men who enjoy misogyny are misogynistic. It is blatantly the other way round. Denying the reality of these men’s actions and pretending the men who wanted to hurt and degrade me still respected me was definitely more comfortable, actually. Do you think women enjoy being aware of the reality of all the depraved and misogynistic shit more and more men are increasingly enjoying doing to women? It’s not comfortable at all. 

I don’t care about the UK buying more sex toys? I didn’t think all sex toys were associated with kink anyway and a lot of people were probably buying them for theirselves. There’s many sex toys that are completely unrelated to bdsm so why should this be relevant? Or is it because you think i’m against sex and masturbation lmao.

Besides, in a generation full of people who grew up watching porn where other humans are degraded and beaten, yes obviously the “stigma” fades fast. I am completely aware of that. Not sure why you think I would be unaware of how mainstream bdsm and violent kinks have become, it’s everywhere ffs.",1638106907,"someone can choose to become a porn star (many people who do are young and unaware of the reality of the industry) and still be a victim of something that was done to them on set.","young and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"young and unaware","young",NA,NA,0

"hmaqln0","&gt; To be honest if they had made what they called ""medium"" high, maxed out the density sliders at 50 instead of 100 - and locked anything higher behind .INI changes people would have been a lot less angry.

Bingo. Alex from Digital Foundry goes deep into this subject when he talks about ports and how casual users refer to some ports as being ""optimized"" and others as being ""unoptimized."" The basic jist of it is that the games people claim to be unoptimized are the ones that have extremely high scaling of demanding settings like draw distance, which when dialed to the max will nuke performance, while the games that people considered to be ""optimized"" really didn't offer much in the way of future hardware scaling settings, so ""max settings"" was really a joke and ran well for everyone.

GTA IV's port has been wonderful basically since a few weeks after release. I too had a Q6600 overclocked to 3.2, sometimes 3.6Ghz, and a GTX 9800. It ran great for me when I was just playing the game. I have a video here of me playing it back then with an FPS mod (which I believe eventually lead to GTA V and RDR2 having native FPS modes, since the video went viral): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1Hm4K5_Pr0

In that video my frames are a bit low thanks to FRAPS nuking my CPU, and I have traffic density set to 100 which when walking around Time's Square is a foolish endeavor, but yeah it ran great when I wasn't recording and if I set traffic to 33/100. People are just ignorant and unaware of what it actually means to have a proper, optimized game vs one that offers options with the expectation of scaling into the future.

"hm5az03","11. What Is Creation?

Creation is the sum of all God’s Thoughts, in number infinite, and everywhere without all limit. Only love creates, and only like itself. There was no time when all that it created was not there. Nor will there be a time when anything that it created suffers any loss. Forever and forever are God’s Thoughts exactly as they were and as they are, unchanged through time and after time is done.

God’s Thoughts are given all the power that their own Creator has. For He would add to love by its extension. Thus His Son shares in creation, and must therefore share in power to create. What God has willed to be forever One will still be One when time is over; and will not be changed throughout the course of time, remaining as it was before the thought of time began.

Creation is the opposite of all illusions, for creation is the truth. Creation is the holy Son of God, for in creation is His Will complete in every aspect, making every part container of the whole. Its oneness is forever guaranteed inviolate; forever held within His holy Will, beyond all possibility of harm, of separation, imperfection and of any spot upon its sinlessness.

We are creation; we the Sons of God. We seem to be discrete, and unaware of our eternal unity with Him. Yet back of all our doubts, past all our fears, there still is certainty. For love remains with all its Thoughts, its sureness being theirs. God’s memory is in our holy minds, which know their oneness and their unity with their Creator. Let our function be only to let this memory return, only to let God’s Will be done on earth, only to be restored to sanity, and to be but as God created us.

"hlu3lor","For people asking how this could happen:

I have a friend who posed for Playboy in 2009. She doesn't have a very active social media presence, so she has a lot of problems with people taking her pictures and making fake scam accounts. She does, however, have a small fans Facebook page that she updates very sporadically. I'm an admin for her page, I mostly screen the PMs (SO MANY COCKS) to see which ones she needs to actually see and respond to, which are very, very few. In late 2016, the page got a message from a guy that claimed that he was in a relationship with her and was trying to contact her. Um, excuse me, I know her boyfriend, he's currently on Gears 4 with me, and it's not you. I send him a message.

The guy starts explaining how he's been in contact with her, totally fictitious backstory involving Nigeria (because of fucking course) and that he had left his family and had moved to be with her. Whoever actually was doing the scamming somehow got him to move 180 miles away from where she actually lived, blissfully unaware that he was actually that close. Red flags, set off, I want to just block him, she wants to help.

She kind of felt bad for him and messaged him privately, told them that he'd been scammed, offered to help him get back home but made sure he knew in no uncertain terms that she wasn't who he was talking to. She agreed to call him on my phone, which has a different area code from the one she lives in. The guy went *nuts*. As in batshit insane, not nuts. The guy was in his 50s, had been a preacher, LEFT HIS WIFE FOR AN E-GIRL and was going off on her, blaming her for tempting him. Here's one of the last messages he sent:

"hlr31jf","11. What Is Creation?

Creation is the sum of all God’s Thoughts, in number infinite, and everywhere without all limit. Only love creates, and only like itself. There was no time when all that it created was not there. Nor will there be a time when anything that it created suffers any loss. Forever and forever are God’s Thoughts exactly as they were and as they are, unchanged through time and after time is done.

God’s Thoughts are given all the power that their own Creator has. For He would add to love by its extension. Thus His Son shares in creation, and must therefore share in power to create. What God has willed to be forever One will still be One when time is over; and will not be changed throughout the course of time, remaining as it was before the thought of time began.

Creation is the opposite of all illusions, for creation is the truth. Creation is the holy Son of God, for in creation is His Will complete in every aspect, making every part container of the whole. Its oneness is forever guaranteed inviolate; forever held within His holy Will, beyond all possibility of harm, of separation, imperfection and of any spot upon its sinlessness.

We are creation; we the Sons of God. We seem to be discrete, and unaware of our eternal unity with Him. Yet back of all our doubts, past all our fears, there still is certainty. For love remains with all its Thoughts, its sureness being theirs. God’s memory is in our holy minds, which know their oneness and their unity with their Creator. Let our function be only to let this memory return, only to let God’s Will be done on earth, only to be restored to sanity, and to be but as God created us.

Our Father calls to us. We hear His Voice, and we forgive creation in the Name of its Creator, Holiness Itself, Whose Holiness His Own creation shares; Whose Holiness is still a part of us.",1637661963,"we seem to be discrete, and unaware of our eternal unity with him.","discrete, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"discrete , and unaware","discrete",NA,NA,0
"hlqtgyo","Ya this is my general feel with the work after going through all the novels as well (Though more politely worded). The author really does have you get inside of the bastard that is Rudeus Greyrat. The books especially do not let you forget what he is and it's vomit inducing at times early on, but that's the important part. I've been watching anime for well over a decade now, and so often these works come from a place of apathy the fetishism on clear display but allowing people to just put it to the back of their head. Mushokue doesn't do that and makes us look right at his ugly side. Mushoku never really reachs say welcome to the NHK lvl of the exploration on the topic, but it's a fantasy and it doesn't need to. What struck me with the show right away though was how it near immediately paints him as a piece of shit as well as the constant monologue and always showing his true form in the void world. They really are doing as much as they can to avoid any sort of self insertion. This is very important with how the show often frames scenes to character through POV and subjective shot composition in combination with his monologue rather than omniscience objective composition. The message is rarely ""this is how you should feel"", but ""this is how Rudeus feels"" as I see it. It's a running motif that runs throughout the direction of the show. On a narrative level they also go out of their way to show the abuse of children is indeed a bad thing through a few of the characters. Ruijerd especially is the most unambiguously good character in the series and is a literally protector of children. Those who abuse children are then seen as villainous and scum. It's quite heavy handed in allot of ways. Rudeus is as he's been shown time and time again hypocritical and unaware of his own faults. Aisha from the most recent episode helped hammer that home further for viewers. That's personally how I see how they've handled the adaptation. 

Also as you said the scale of fiction Mushoku is rare. It's 26 books and 9X the page count of the lord of the rings. Like this first season if it was say part of a 90 min or so film would be equal to the first 18 ish minutes of run time. The author paces it how he wants it and that pace is slow and methodical with things foreshadowed 20+ books in advance sometimes. He really had it all planned out and he didn't waver in that pacing and I think the series is better for it personally. That being said it is an investment, and from the initial bit without hindsight I definitely understand why some people view it the way they do. It's hard to stomach early Rudeus even if you grow the appreciate how shitty he was in time. it's not a perfect series, but it's definitely one worth while all said in done that has had great impact on various creators throughout the years since its release.",1637653645,"rudeus is as he's been shown time and time again hypocritical and unaware of his own faults.","hypocritical and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"again hypocritical and unaware","hypocritical",NA,"again",0

EP 5 Theory

This just popped into my head rn.

Please excuse the bad writing. 

From the teaser of Ep 5 it seems like Pat is confessing his ""feelings"" to Ink. 

I cannot trust the teaser at all after how deceiving Ep 4 teaser was.

Also, I just can't digest the fact that Pat is dense and unaware of his feelings for Pran (I had the opposite opinion 2 days ago lol but I have my reasons for changing my opinion). Him asking Pran whether Pran thinks Ink likes him seemed like Pat was trying to feed this idea into Pran head that there could be a girl out there who likes him. 

My theory: 

There's one scene in the teaser where Pat and Pran are at the guitar shop again and Pat is looking at Pran. Pran notices it and Pat quickly looks away (you will have to watch that moment at 0.25x speed to notice it). I feel like here he has figured out he likes Pran.
This scene I'm assuming (but I'm also kind of sure about it) is before the Freshy Day.

All of that asking Korn what makes our hearts beat faster could be before the guitar shop scene but definitely before Freshy Day. 

I think on Freshy Day he is FULLY aware of his feelings for Pran and tells Ink about it. Ink encourages Pat to confess his feelings to Pran. Pat tries to show Ink how he'd go about it. His confession seems kind of dull cause he's scared and doesn't know how Pran will react. So Ink, in response, says that that doesn't feel like a love confession. 

I have no clue about the fight scene and the last scene.",1637607066,"also, i just can't digest the fact that pat is dense and unaware of his feelings for pran (i had the opposite opinion 2 days ago lol but i have my reasons for changing my opinion).","dense and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"dense and unaware","dense",NA,NA,0

I grew up in a very conformist society where the nail that sticks out is hammered down. As a quirky person with ADHD, it was a nightmare since I felt nobody respected me or appreciated me for who I was, everyone around me - parents, doctors, teachers, classmates, camp counsellors, therapists, etc - acted like I was taking up too much space on purpose just to be an asshole and never properly addressed my adhd. Negative reinforcement, brutal punishment, being made to feel like everything is my fault, and very little praise every day of my life. When I moved to America and realized things could be different, it was like a massive weight off my chest! I finally got the intensive therapy and psychiatric help I so desperately needed. 

It was a slow burn (C-PTSD) rather than intense acute events,  so it felt like I shouldn’t be this damaged (so more self loathing from that too). But growing up to the age of 25 with everyone trying to change you and making you feel inadequate and like you’re a horrible mean person is indeed traumatizing if it happens over and over again and you can’t seem to succeed at changing into what you’re “supposed to be”.

Sometimes I feel guilty and weak having PTSD when I always had a roof over my head, was fed, had a family who claimed to love me, am bright and well-educated, when people who’ve gone through way worse have it for real. 

But when I look back on how my husband grew up vs how I grew up it made sense. Being born into a world that doesn’t want you is really tough for anyone I think. Having everyone constantly try to change you as if THEIR sudden tip will magically make a difference and never experiencing the appreciation for who I was is something quite rare and heartbreaking especially over time. 

When you come from a culture where equality and not taking up too much space is the gold standard, being neurodivergent and unaware of why you can’t seem to figure out how to fit in and be good enough is so demoralizing. When your parents accuse your husband of being a gold digger because he decides to marry ME is yet another knife to my heart. When you spend more time outside the class than in it and get acceleration refused despite other kids who scored lower in school getting it feels like a personal attack. Being excluded from every social group using virtue signalling reasons (if they even provide reasons at all) that make you feel defective These micro- and macro-aggressions on a daily basis can destroy a person. I just wish SOMEONE would have appreciated me as I was. Yet that didn’t happen till my 20s. Even my “friends” had turned me into their project to change.

Im taking an antipsychotic to deal with the crippling anxiety, dissociation, and flashbacks.

I ended up in bed (nothing sexual happened) with this guy I had built up a very strong emotional connection for over the past years.

I myself went slowly down and felt completely numb for the rest of the week. Since I'm trying to be better I asked him at the end of the week if he was still willing to meet up, or otherwise after all those weeks (which would have been fine by me because I was completely drained). He responded that he didn't want to continue, but was hoping I didn't felt too disappointed. When I asked why, he couldn't explain but based it on a gut feeling he had. Also apologized for responding late because he had been busy(?) which was really weird. Kept continue to ask how my weekend was. 

I felt confused at the beginning, but shortly after actually felt quite relieved, haha. Because I was already stressing out to much, becoming very negative about possible expectations. I expressed this to him as well, which must have been confusing for him also I guess?

"hkqiacw","No, *Leda* received a letter. (Why would Rokeby write to Ted and Joan?) We don't know if Rokeby himself wrote it, or if it was written by Gillespie or another representative simply to note that Strike's 18th birthday marks the end of child support payments. 

Part of my question is whether this was a legal form letter that Strike misinterprets as a warning from Rokeby not to expect any additional help with college expenses beyond the money that's been untouched for years. Strike doesn't say so to Robin, and he doesn't say how he felt about the letter. But he seems to have reasoned (A) my aunt and uncle told my father about my Oxford acceptance and (B) my mother received a letter saying not to expect any more more money. B happened after A; therefore, A caused B--a classic post hoc fallacy. If this is what Strike thought, it might help explain why his hotter-headed teenaged self felt moved to go insult Rokeby in person. 

My frustration is that none of this is ever stated, forcing me as a reader to make leaps and guesses in response to Strike's incomplete explanation to Robin--which explanation itself is probably based on Strike's own leaps and guesses. As u/zsenyasq points out, I don't think we can trust what Strike says. He may have the bare facts right, but his comments about motive are suspect--like his assumption that when Jonny smiles at him and congratulates him, it's only  because Jonny sees his newly-turned-adult son as a threat:

&gt;Got a smile off Rokeby this time. Well, I was off his hands financially now, but old enough to talk to the press. Oxford had clearly been a bit of a shock to him. He’d probably hoped, with a background like mine, I’d slide quietly out of sight forever.

Adult Strike talks big but I sense a world of hurt and accusation behind those tough words. ""A background like mine""--squats, communes, constant uprootings, poverty, awful father-substitutes like Whittaker--mainly happened because his real father never took an active role in his upbringing.

"hkq2g8h","I have no idea how you read that from the film but hey, this isn't the thread for popular opinions. 

Dani, in the film, is going through abject trauma and she's doing it almost entirely alone. Christian is emotionally unavailable at the time when she needs him most. He's completely self-involved and unaware of what Dani is going through. You have to pay attention to what the film doesn't say as much as what it does, because grief and trauma are huge thematic elements in there. 

Dani has been watching her sister's mental illness unfold for years and this is no doubt a source of serious anxiety. So when the movie opens with her entire family being annihilated by her sister, it's not just a shock, it's a culmination of anxiety, so yeah...she's not really paying attention to people around her. She's a little preoccupied with her own grief. Again, that's one of the main themes of the movie. 

As far as attention goes, she DOES need some kind of attention right now, anyone in her shoes would. She needs to be supported and feel like she's not alone. That's basic humanity right there. And because her friends do not provide this, she's left in an *incredibly* vulnerable place. 

People in those vulnerable places are the ones that are easiest to pull into a cult, unfortunately. And once she's there, I don't anything would be able to pull her away from it. That's sort of the culmination of the themes in the film...she's been left cold and alone and grieving, and a cult was there to pick her up. They gave her what she needed: They let her feel like she wasn't alone in grief, they helped her explore that grief, they showed her that death is a natural part of life not to be feared but, in fact, to be embraced and celebrated. And then they took this woman who felt absolutely powerless in her life and gave her some serious power. Indeed, the power to decide who lives and who dies. 

I think the movie is positively brilliant. Dani isn't a villain, she's a victim the whole way through, and pretty much everyone else is some sort of villain. Even the cult that gives her what she needs is doing so out of its own interests. They're not lifting her up because they are caring humans who know what she needs, they are doing it because having her on board is good for them. Internally, they probably see it as mutually beneficial because I'm sure they're all true believers. But externally, it's manipulative. 

Anyhow, point is, I think you've got literally the worst take on this movie I've ever seen, so good job on understanding the assignment of this thread.",1636987234,"he's completely self-involved and unaware of what dani is going through.","involved and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"involved and unaware","involved",NA,NA,0

"hknr4hk","ADHD/ADD is an interesting condition. Because EMDR helps so much with presence and dissociation, dissociation essentially allowing your mind to be elsewhere while you go about your day to day life, it really impacts a lot of the symptoms of ADD, too. 

I know this because I have complex PTSD with strong dissociative tendencies that really overlap inattentiveness, forgetfulness, scattered thinking that you experience with ADD. I was diagnosed with ADD in early adulthood. PTSD late adulthood. C-PTSD a couple of years ago.   
There are theories that a lot of what is diagnosed in kids with ADD/ADHD is trauma/stress related. In today's world, that makes sense.   
Don't be alarmed in thinking I am suggesting ADD/ADHD is mental illness - it is not.   
I think of it as matrix thinking. It's a strong coping mechanism in a complex world to be tuned in to EVERYTHING at once, especially when kids are expected to sit perfectly still in class and learn in a linear way - not natural for lots of humans.   
In my ADD state of mind, I'm taking in everything at once with almost no filter or hyper-focused and unaware of what's going on around me.   
IN short, EMDR really cut back a lot of my ADD/ADHD behaviors and inattentiveness, lack of focus. The theories about childhood trauma and ADD/ADHD make a lot of sense. Life is hard and our world is not child-focused. We expect a lot of children in school, in activities, relationships and there is not a lot of support for kids in our complex world. Tuning out, checking out, not having strong presence strategies all attribute to what is often called ADD/ADHD.   
I'm not an expert, just really experienced in the life journey of trying to sort out what is atypical about my way of existing in the world and taking it in. I just know what has worked for me. I am not saying ADD/ADHD is not a \*thing,\* it certainly is.

"hkmu8pn","My first ""love"" was at the age of 14 to a young man who ended up being brutally abusive. After moving away from my family to be with him (i couldn't gather why nobody wanted us together) he shattered both of my orbital bones. At this point I returned home with both of my eyes swollen shut and decided that perhaps we just were not meant to be. Fast forward a year past many ups and (mostly) downs, we are living in a tent in the woods so that we can continue in this toxic circus that nobody seems to understand. Something provoked him one night and what I remember is this...
Walking behind him by a fair distance, he turns around and runs full force at me landing his giant foot in my abdomen. I go down and get back up taking several powerful blows in the process, this ends with me in a sleeper hold, after I was unconscious he smashed a giant rock into my head. The damage done was bad....collapsed ribs, ruptured spleen and a subdural hematoma as well as various broken bones in my face. He left me for dead.
When I returned to consciousness I walked out of the woods into a suburban area thinking I was fine physically. My stomach was distended so much that I appeared pregnant. Blood covered me. First responders found me wandering a neighborhood confused and unaware of the extent of my injuries. Fortunately I was able to avoid having my spleen removed because i was unconscious long enough for the blood to impact the wound, they did have to relieve the pressure of the blood in my skull. The left side of my face droops sometimes.
A couple years ago he shot his girlfriend 9 times in their Charlotte, NC apartment with their newborn baby inside, then drove himself to the police station and told them what he did.Hes in prison now.

"hkmosz8","I’ve had 4 Great Pyrenees and worked with breeders in breeding/showing and working farm environments. 

With that being said, my experience is with Great Pyrenees that we’re bred to breed standards with amazing temperament and disposition, so not knowing the particular dog I would take everything said with at least a pinch of salt ;) 

Most Great Pyrenees (every one I’ve met) are amazing with kids. But they can be clumsy and unaware of their body. Other than the potential of being snuggled to death I would trust my Great Pyrenees with the lives of my 3 and 4 year old nieces. I’ve never seen any aggressive tendencies in any of my Pyrenees with kids. Quite the opposite they tend to put up with everything. Even too much at times (I recently caught my 3 year old niece riding my one and a half year old GP 🤦‍♀️).  If you’re unfamiliar with dog body language and such, maybe have a trainer familiar with guardian breeds come in and work with the dog and your son for a session.  If he’s a standard GP my guess is the trainer won’t pick up on any aggression and it will provide your son (and you) with some good insights and confidence.

I joke that one of my Pyrs “Suzie” wants to be an inside dog, but she still loves her outdoor time. You’ll want to either have a fenced yard or plan on leashes walks. Great Pyrenees are not good off leash. Also, he will most likely bark at times when he’s outside which is a consideration if you have neighbors. GP don’t need a ton of exercise but being indoors I would suspect he may get bored so plan on things that will mentally stimulate him. Puzzle games etc for when you’re at work will help him stay busy and adjust well. After all, 1 and a half is still a bit of a puppy. 

My Great Pyrenees have all been fabulous with other animals and other people. However, I’ve had two Great Pyrenees, that were aggressive with other dogs. Not every dog, most of the time they were totally fine. But they were prone to resource guarding. I’ve never had a GP fight a dog at the dog park or anything like that. Mostly just aggression over food dishes which was easily solved by moving them to their own safe locations to eat. It doesn’t sound like this will be a problem for you, but something to keep in mind if you do doggy play dates. 

Health issues. None of my GP have had any. But GP are prone to bloat, elbow and hip dysplasia, and patellar luxation. Death by bloat can be almost eliminated by having the stomach tacked. This can be done while the dog is being fixed, so a good thing to talk to your vet about.  All other issues can be avoided by good breeding (which you can’t help at this point) and a good diet and exercise. 

I would plan on grooming him every day. (Allow 15 min) to keep his coat from matting. They don’t really drool that much. Nothing compared to a say a Saint Bernard. Mainly just when you have food they want or when they’re done eating/drinking. As for heat, they don’t love it but they can tolerate it with shade and cold water. If he’s indoor/outdoor he’ll probably prefer to be indoor in the summer. Make sure you don’t shave his coat. His coat is designed to keep him cool. Shaving it can lead to overheating and sunburn. He’ll tolerate cold just fine (bred to live in the snow). 

Talk to your vet about the stomach tacking to prevent bloat. And maybe ask for references to a trainer that has experience with guardian breeds if they have any. Having a trainer who knows the breed work with you a few times can change your entire experience for the better. 

Also be prepared for a lot of selective listening. GP are smart and can be trained, but they tend to ignore commands they don’t want to listen to. They also tend to be sensitive souls and get their feelings hurt if you’re gruff with them. Building trust through gentle but firm training is going to be the best way to go. 

I would say, start by visiting him and if that goes well see if you can take him home for a couple of weeks. The first bit of time will be the toughest time, but I think you’ll know personality wise if he’s a good fit.

"hkmlzlg","Thanks for starting this conversation.

I’m born in the African continent, and I’ve experienced being a diaspora because I’ve lived abroad in different countries, so it’s been interesting.


In my home country, being black has only become a recent conversation, since we’ve imported a lot of American culture through music, movies, etc. Not that we don’t discuss or engage critically with race, but the identity politics conversation here feels very foreign and exclusively American. In my country at least, the biggest conversation is about Africanness. (Not the ancient Egypt kind of Africanness either)


My experience living abroad was telling. I was living in a country that is very homogenous and unaware of blackness and black people in general. Since I speak English too, many people assumed I was American, which to me was always a privilege because I got to be a “cool foreigner”. African Americans however would be offended whenever someone asked them if they were African, but could never articulate why. (Theoretically, I get it. Double consciousness and all). 


I honestly feel that the American version of blackness monopolizes the conversation, simply because it is American. The US as a nation monopolizes, it’s a point of power, and it’s simply the international system. It’s difficult therefore to critically engage with African Americans who don’t realize or refuse the acknowledge the American privilege that characterizes their position. In Portuguese, we call this “lugar de fala”, something like “positionality”. 


I think African Americans need to think amore about positionality. What space do they occupy in the global race conversation? How can alternative experiences be given the space to emerge and share?

Not to mention the people saying if a black woman tried to write a book like this it wouldn't get published like WHAT. How can you be that fucking ignorant and unaware of the fact there's tonsss of memoirs like this written by women of color. Same thing about the media thing. Tons of stories like this told on screen about women of color/families of color. 

I'll give em there was more of them in the 90s and 2000s, but to say that stuff wouldn't get picked up or doesn't get published is just ridiculous when there's literally so many examples of the opposite.

Like just because one thing exists doesn't take it away from someone else. The world is allowed to show the struggles of a poor white woman dealing with dv.

 I'll take it a step further and say on a subconscious level the real reason these people don't like it is because it ruins their image that all white people are privileged and only women of color struggle like this and they like that structure. They don't want to see it can happen to them. They like their privilege which is why they put so much effort to virtue signal against it.

"hkhb7l8","&gt;I would rule that the sleeping Bandits are Unconscious, and would be awoken and added to the Initiative order after the first round. Is this RAW? 

Mostly.

* If they are sleeping they are *unconscious*. (XG p. 77) They are most likely also *prone*.
* In order to wake someone they can simply yell using a free action. Attacking a creature also wakes it. This will end the unconscious condition, but if the first round is not yet done, they may still be surprised. (XG p. 77)
* They should be added to the initiative order at the beginning of combat, not after they wake up. (PHB p. 189)
* Whether or not they are surprised is determined when initiative is rolled. If they are unconscious, they should naturally also be surprised. (PHB p. 189)

&gt; I would rule that the Rogue, due to this particular environment allowing him to get to melee range without being seen, is ""Attacking from Hiding,"" even with a melee weapon, and has Advantage on the strike. Is this reasonable?

The DM may allow for certain circumstances to grant advantage:

&gt;In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. **However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.** (PHB p. 177)

&gt;Despite having the first turn in Initiative order, the Bandit would, mechanically speaking, be both Surprised and unaware of the rogue, right? Losing his ability to take an action, and granting Advantage on the rogue's attack? This seems odd to me; can you be Surprised by something you aren't aware of (yet)? 

Yes to all three. *Surprised* means you can't take actions or move on your turn, and can't use reactions until after your turn. Unseen and unheard are two psuedo-conditions that are pre-requisites to being hidden. If the rogue's stealth score beats the passive perception of the bandit, then they are both unseen and unheard, otherwise known as *hidden*. 

&gt;The Bandit was Surprised because the Rogue, specifically, approached stealthily and beat his PP score. However, the other players are preceding the Rogue in Initiative Order and did not make additional stealth checks. So... Is the Bandit still Surprised, even before the Rogue's turn? Because these other players have suddenly made themselves known, sauntering in, guns swords akimbo, before the Rogue's big play. 

If they are sixty feet away in the darkness, they may be effectively hidden. It's apparent that the bandit did not detect the party up until that point, meaning they are both unseen and unheard. Per RAW, normal noise can be heard up to 2d6x10 feet away, so you may wish to determine this as they party is approaching a potential encounter. If the other players act before the rogue, it's entirely possible that they give up their ambush. That being said, the bandit is absolutely still surprised. That condition lasts until the end of the first round.",1636825933,"** (phb p. 177)  &gt;despite having the first turn in initiative order, the bandit would, mechanically speaking, be both surprised and unaware of the rogue, right?","surprised and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"surprised and unaware","surprised",NA,NA,0

I think being surprised by something due to being unaware of it is part of the definition of a surprise lol but it's possible I misunderstood the question

IMO, the Rogue should be the only one getting a surprise round in this situation. As in, the rogue makes his move despite his order in initiative and THEN initiative order starts. Assuming I understand this correctly. That's how I would rule it in my games at least.

&gt;If everything above is mechanically sound, is the answer to the narrative weirdness here ""everything is happening simultaneously in six seconds"" and the turn order just doesn't do a great job of communicating what's happening?

More or less. Sometimes mechanics and narrative weirdness do butt heads but I don't personally feel like this is one of those times. In every game I've played that utilizes the concept of a surprise round, the players in the surprise round go first despite their placement in the initiative order vs the bandits, as the bandits don't get a surprise round

"hkflqco","Your account here is correct. Once a combat action is *declared* initiative is rolled. The rolled initiative will determine whether anything reacted fast enough to go before the declared action, and whether anyone is surprised. 

&gt;I would rule that the sleeping Bandits are Unconscious, and would be awoken and added to the Initiative order after the first round. Is this RAW?

Honestly, don't know, I've always winged unconsciousness. I think there might be perception checks involved? What I'd do is add them to initiative when initiative is rolled, and then have unconsciousness be a condition they either roll to end on their turn or are shaken out of by another creature spending its action to do so.

&gt;I would rule that the Rogue, due to this particular environment allowing him to get to melee range without being seen, is ""Attacking from Hiding,"" even with a melee weapon, and has Advantage on the strike. Is this reasonable?

Yes. While 5e does treat it as if you can see everywhere around you all the time, that's clearly ridiculous in the context of specifically sneaking up behind someone, so you should count as unseen. Although, I would say that the Rogue doesn't move out of its hiding place until it actually gets its turn, so the bandit can't see it until it leaps out. 

&gt;Despite having the first turn in Initiative order, the Bandit would, mechanically speaking, be both Surprised and unaware of the rogue, right? Losing his ability to take an action, and granting Advantage on the rogue's attack? This seems odd to me; can you be Surprised by something you aren't aware of (yet)?

This is a bit loose. Either interpretation is reasonable in different ways imo. Consider representing ""surprised"" as ""not yet in combat"". Initiative had to be rolled because at least one person chose to enter combat (the Rogue in this case), but it takes the Bandit's first turn for it to realise something is up.

&gt;Is the Bandit still Surprised, even before the Rogue's turn?

When initiative is rolled, you determine Surprise. A creature is surprised if it is not aware of any hostile intentions when initiative is rolled (creatures do not necessarily need to be hidden for this to occur - eg if I walked up to your mother and just stabbed her in the knee, she'd be pretty damn surprised cos she would never have expected that to happen). If the other players could also not be seen when initiative is rolled, but then come marching in, the bandit remains surprised (it can't become unsurprised until it takes its turn). Also, if the other PCs aren't expecting combat either, they may be surprised too. 

&gt;is the answer to the narrative weirdness here ""everything is happening simultaneously in six seconds"" and the turn order just doesn't do a great job of communicating what's happening?

Yes.",1636787326,"although, i would say that the rogue doesn't move out of its hiding place until it actually gets its turn, so the bandit can't see it until it leaps out.   &gt;despite having the first turn in initiative order, the bandit would, mechanically speaking, be both surprised and unaware of the rogue, right?","surprised and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"surprised and unaware","surprised",NA,NA,0

"hkch8rd","OP, I hope you read this because I have first hand experience with this situation. 

I often am like this. This has happened to me with both of my long term partners. Sometimes I felt great and in love and ready to plan a future, and sometimes I was sure I no longer loved them and was down or lonely any time I met up with them. 

The first time I experienced this, I was young and unaware of my mental state. I knew I was depressed, but I didn't know depression could cause this as well. It was only after my relationship ended and I went to therapy for 3 years that I realised it. I had to go on medication too because my situation was quite severe (not saying your bf's is as well, only a professional can tell you that). I wish I knew I was depressed and not actually out of love. Depression often times leads to numbness and the loss of emotions. It doesn't necessarily mean suicidal thoughts or sadenss, it comes in many shapes and forms and this is one of them: emptiness. That emptiness feels like you've lost feelings and it feels so true, so real, so solid, that you think it HAS to be that the love has died when in reality, it's like a dark blanket being thrown over your emotions hiding them. 

This numbness is considered a coping mechanism according to the professionals I've met. It could be his work, his family, his everyday life, general happiness with how he or his life turned out, his childhood, any hidden trauma. It could be a coping mechanism for anything that we don't know, but you, him or preferably professional could likely figure it out because it is often times a myriad of interlinked, complicated issues, not just one black and white issue.

This stopped happening to me when I received GOOD treatment by a GOOD therapist. Unfortunately it returned in my second (and current) long term relationship as I stopped medication and therapy due to poor finances but for a few years I was doing great. The difference is that now I am AWARE. So now, when I feel like my love has died, I wait. I don't say it to them. I sit with those feelings and like them stir. I wait weeks if I have to because chances are that feeling goes away and that's how I test if I'm suffering from mental instability or genuine relationship slump (the latter has happened as well). It's unstable. It's tough. It's confusing and it's very, very lonely knowing many don't understand. Feeling *nothing* is sometimes a lot heavier than feeling hurt or anger or sadness because you don't fully understand it, yet it somehow swallows you whole and disrupts everything in your life slowly making you more and more mentally unstable.

Your boyfriend does sound depressed. However, reddit is not a place to diagnose that. I hope you can convince him to explore this idea and hopefully at least try one session of therapy to see. Yes, it IS possible it is just his feelings dying out but it's also likely possible his depression is confusing the fuck out of them. 

I want to give another story, one of my friend. Her bf was severely depression and he said a couple of times his feelings were dying out. She thought it was his depression and tried being there for him in every way. In the end, turns out his feelings really were gone. Yes, he was depressed, but yes, his feelings were also genuinely gone and soon after he started dating someone else. So I do not want to give you false hope that therapy and a conversation will save your relationship, but it is very important you try nonetheless because in the case it is depression, your understanding and support will play a crucial role. It is a hard and demanding position on an SO, I also know this from first hand experience, but I hope you hang tight and I hope he gets better soon. Because this is something very close to my heart, I feel for you and I'm sending love your way.

"hkbbczs","Ok I owe you a better response than what I gave you. 

&gt;Not to mention the people’s stubborn inability to understand that billionaires play a different game.

Yeah so? They didn't play a different game to become billionaires, apart from taking risk. Most business fail within first year. That is why we have so *few* billionaires (cca 600). Most of them (2/3) are self made. And you know what? If you would become one, you would act exactly the same, don't be fooled by your self righteousness. Everyone dislikes paying taxes, and at least you have a progressive income tax in US. The top 25% of richeat people in US are responsible for 70% of all taxes collected. They do pay less (average tax rate) then what they should according to their tax bracket but so does everyone else. Average tax rate for the bottom 50% is just 4% while the lowest tax bracket is 10%. On the other end top 1% average tax rate is 26% while it should be 37%. They pay more in taxes then anyone else, both in absolute terms and relative. 

&gt;Hell no! If they want to buy an island, will they have it available? Yes they will.

What do you care if someone buys an island? You jealous? I will come to that later.

&gt;And they will be able to do that in the way that they will pay no taxes in the process.

And if they are US citizens, believe me, they are going to pay that tax. What richest people do more effectively then others is to legally avoid paying income tax as much as they ""should"". You would do the same. No one likes giving away money. The way they do it is by not having any income. They don't need it, because their private life can be financed by a company and hence be represented as a business expense. It is very hard to distinguish what is actually private and what business because it is all *life*. This may seem dumb to you but it is true. The thing is, you can do it too. But it is a bit risky, and many business fail within a year. So most people opt to just take a job which is more secure, but it doesn't have the perks of owning a business. It is a trade off. 

While there are people who avoid taxes altogether by misreporting what they owe or earn, if they get caught they are going to pay much more and spend some time in prison. Since tax control is essentially random, some of them are going to get away with it. However, we are not talking about them.

&gt;Stop with this bullshit “tHeY hAvE it AlL in StOcks”. They have the wealth. Tax the f***ers already.

It is not bullshit. The distinction you objected to is not trivial. They are taxed already. Now, you could argue that the 600 billionaires should be taxed with a special, higher bracket and that is fine. One should be cautious as to downside of it like hampering the entrance of new billionaires into the pool - which is bad. You might disagree, but this is a bit counterintuitive. You actually want more people to get rich. Eventually you want everyone to be rich. And they are getting rich. Now this is a bit debatable in the US now, but the thing is the solution is not obvious because every economic policy has unintended consequences.

Anyway, to get back to stocks vs cash. Stocks are not taxed as of now if you don't get dividends (and most people owning stocks do not, because they do not actually own them - but that is another story). You pay taxes only when you sell them. On the other hand, the money in your account is taxed. One of the reasons for this setup is to make you spend your money. Because one persons expense is another one's profit, and this drives the economy up. People buy stocks because money sitting in a bank account is eaten by both the taxes and inflation. Money invested as stocks should rise bt 11% on average. If just owning stocks was taxed it would be bad for most people, because it would become a liability not an asset. Which is bad for investment funds which is bad for retirement funds which is bad for you. And don't forget about the other side of that equation. Every stock sold is fresh capital for a company, that they can invest in more workers, new technology, research, expansion and so on. Cutting that pipe could hurt the economy. A lot. Now, you may say some special rules should be in place for *extremely* rich. Possibly. But just beware that every action has a reaction and unintended consequences. And no one really knows what might happen and to what extent. 

And why the distinction is not trivial? Because the value of stocks is virtual. It is whatever the market (meaning other people are ready to pay for it) says it is. There is no ""real"" value of the stock. There are ways to calculate the value of a given business (their capital, what company owns, profit they will make in next five years) but the stock price can easily go below this value. And how should someone (being rich or regular) who owns stocks pay a tax on those stocks? If stock prices rise (and they do on average) you would need more and more cash from *somewhere* to pay that tax. As I said, stocks suddenly become a liability, a hot potato. Most middle income people would get rid of their stocks to avoid paying extra money, that would have to come from some other source.

And now the final question. Why do you care if someone owns an island? Or have billions? Well, the Marxist theory, that is still popular for some reason, although completely proven wrong both in practice and theory, says that billionaires took that money from you - the workers. Standard economic theory says that money was created and *added* to the economy. And since we are talking about stocks and not actual money, that value is virtual. What would happen to the price of the stock if Elon decides to sell his share all at once? Right. It is not a zero sum game. Some people are getting richer faster then others, but no one is taking anything from you. We evolved to be suspicious of someone who stands out, because in a hunter gatherer tribe someone who has more then the rest must be cheating. 

Anyway, when I told you to read more, I meant books. Basic economy. History of economic thought. Economic history. Basic finance. History. Biographies. Psychology. Sociology. Statistics. I know my comment sounded smug. But ""tax the rich already"" comment showed you are wrong and unaware of complexity of world you are living. And the way to better yourself in the world is to know more about it. 

All the best, and good luck.

A True Master doesn't ""Go With The Flow.""

The Absolute is not passive and it doesn't ""go with the flow."" It both IS the flow *and* directs the flow.

Totally agree.

People completely lost track of the reason why it is said that a drunk person can not consent. It doesn't mean that if you're tipsy, you can't have sex. Very honestly - people often drink in order to lower their inhibitions, and to be able to do what they're craving to do. 

It's meant to cover the case where someone is so wasted that they are apathic and unaware of what is going on, and typically, they might end up having sex with someone they didn't know before the moment they were drunk. This is a case that requires protection.

yes, let's look at it.

18-29 in your chart has roughly equal infection rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated. yet when one looks at the UK gov data about the 18-29 age group, you see the group is 65% vaccinated.

so why are the stats the same size? it's almost as if the vaccine is fucking working you waste of skin.

but yes let's continue looking at data.

40-49 age group, split the UK difference (its segmented by 5 years) and call it 78% vaccinated. if the vaccine did nothing, the vaccinated group would be about 5 times bigger than the unvaccinated group, instead its only about 2 times. huh. why's that? 

now let's look at hospitalizations.

https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2306

_An analysis of UK data from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) and the Coronavirus Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN),1 endorsed by the UK Scientific and Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE),2 shows that of 40 000 patients with covid-19 who were admitted to hospital between December 2020 and July 2021 a total of 33 496 (84%) had not been vaccinated. It found that 5198 (13%) of these patients had received their first vaccine and 1274 (3%) their second. A total of 611 patients with previous covid-19 (reinfection) were not included in the analysis._

84% of hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated? huh. why's that, fucko?

_Data from the Office of National Statistics show that 256 (0.5%) of the 51 281 covid related deaths that occurred in England between 2 January and 2 July 2021 were breakthrough deaths._

whaaaaat? only 0.5% of the deaths are from the fully vaccinated?

"hjc7l9v","That's because it is one of the least effective benzos, way down towards the bottom of the list of the ones if I had to rank the 12 or so I've tried. Phenazepam is the only one I'd put below it as an overall ""experience"". Phenazepam had literally NOTHING good to offer at low doses, and high doses you're blacked out for like 2 days straight, dangerous... And not gonna sleep it away either, very much so lacks hypnotic effects, as does lorazepam, hence why I think both suck, the more hypnotic of effects a benzo has, the better it is.

Funnily enough, it is one of the most widely prescribed, probably because abuse of it results in nothing, nothing, nothing, and then black out.

It just kind of sucks all around. Such better benzos for abuse that are way cleaner. Xanax (proper pharma, not pressed, lord knows what's in a press but it is rarely what they'll tell you and very rarely real alprazolam, luckiest you'll get is flualprazolam, which, to me, is close enough to the real thing), Midazolam, Temazepam, even clonazepam are far superior benzos, all with very different ""use cases"". Like, Xanax and Temazepam, longer acting ""highs"" even at therapeutic doses of 2mg or 30mg respectively. Midazolam as the king of benzo euphoria, especially IV'd (one of the few that is water soluble, add some vitamin C for increased solubility for a larger mg/ml concentration shot), but very short acting.

"hj7c6bd","Wow, thank you for being so thorough!! I'm glad you find all the creature types appropriate, I actually wasn't sure if people would question a lot of them being beasts rather than elementals/monstrosities, for example. As you mentioned, this is an ""adaptation"" rather than a direct translation, so their stats aren't going to line up exactly to how they are in the games. (But like anything else D&amp;D, a DM is welcome to change anything they wish, this is just my own interpretation)

Squirtle: Good catch.

Zubat/Golbat: Since this version of them is focused on blood-sucking (which I think the Poison type is meant to represent), I opted to not factor in poison damage or resistance, but I'll consider it.

The high/epic-level ones having huge statblocks with tons of features was something I was a bit unsure about; I wanted to make them really epic and memorable and do many things, one-of-a-kind encounters rather than ""big bags of hit points"" with simple attacks, but combat complexity is be a factor to consider. As mentioned in another comment, ""simplified"" versions for DMs that want a straightforward fight might be a good idea, in addition to the ""complex"" versions for DMs that get inspired by it.

Kadabra: This is one of those ""personal bias"" things, I prefer Kadabra's design with the big bushy tail more than Alakazam's. It could easily be renamed to Alakazam with no other changes, I just didn't see a need for two similar 'all-knowing sages' and chose the one I liked.

Slowpoke/Weezing: They're defensive in Pokemon, but my interpretation here is different. Slowpoke's primary trait is being dopey and unaware of its surroundings, thus it has poor AC, but high HP and an Uncanny Dodge equivalent so it's still annoying to fight. Weezing's a floating ball of toxic gas, so its danger is primarily from exploding (which might happen instantly if the party likes fire/lightning damage!). It actually does have pretty sturdy natural armor - 17 before being reduced by DEX.

Mr. Mime: Was super fun to choose thematic spells for! Wall of Force might be a bit too potent as a barrier when it already has a lot of mime tricks, but it's worth considering. I figured it doesn't need Mage Armor more than once a day anyway, but at-will is probably a better idea.

Ditto: Its Shapechanger does say, ""It copies all the target's equipment that is being worn or carried [...] and all copied items disappear when the ditto reverts to its true form."" Does it need more specificity? I have to admit, I never would've thought about it duplicating food!

Eevees: Vaporeon/Flareon have super high HP/Attack in Pokemon for game balance, but I try to judge their stats here based on how they compare to an average human (all 10s), or other similar creatures, to keep the numbers in check. Vaporeon does have extra hit dice to compensate. Vaporeon's spells are mostly water control, Flareon's are offensive support, and I figured Jolteon's high speed and ranged attacks would compensate (plus, a lack of flavorful spell options), but I could give it another look.

Kabutops: I totally didn't realize that's how Parry worked, or the connection to Defensive Duelist, thanks!

Snorlax: Because it's such a big, slow target, I felt it made more sense for it to be easy to hit but be able to take a serious beating from its sheer bulk. Likewise, even though it has high Special Defense, the intent for it to be a brute that cares only about eating, hence its average WIS (perhaps x2 proficiency on Keen Smell would work?).

Legendary Birds: At-will Control Weather was something I was going to include as a regional effect/lair action, like the ki-rin in Volo's, but I haven't gotten that far yet.

Dragonite: Since Dragonair/ite are so physically different, rather than one growing into the other, I considered them as separate creatures. They're both neutral good dragons, but otherwise unrelated. Seismic Slam does say ""The dragonite piledrives a creature it is grappling into the ground,"" should it be reiterated?

Mewtwo: I honestly wondered if it was TOO crazy, but as some kind of insane superboss I figured it has that right :P Catapult is on its spell list, but having it at-will works too. Regional effects/lair actions weren't included yet, some effects might be moved there instead (and damage might need adjusting to compensate). I planned to save ""change anything to any damage type"" for Arceus, and gave Mewtwo an insane spell list instead, which it can cast as a legendary action while using recharge moves on its own turn, but because of its sheer complexity I should probably make a ""simplified"" version. Scrying isn't a bad idea, but I figured it can already see everything within 2 miles with Creature Sense, Arcane Eye, and Clairvoyance, and it probably wants to be left alone rather than spy on people.

Mew: Another deviation from Pokemon lore, my interpretation is that Mew is something like Arceus' special creation and #2, a celestial/angelic being rather than a 'psychic' one, and not connected to Mewtwo (another reason why it'd be nice to make different names). Technically Mewtwo has more HP from its regeneration (225 + (25 x 3) = 300, by the DMG calculations), but if Mew were ever 'killed' (extraordinarily difficult with all its escape tools), it would re-appear on Mt. Celestia as if nothing happened. Its higher CR mostly comes from being able to deal insane damage with, say, Meteor Swarm and Incendiary Cloud if it *really* wanted to, which Mewtwo doesn't have access to. Mew's Change Shape also retains its own spellcasting ability (which is all but a few spells in the entire game), so I don't think turning into another spellcaster would benefit it, right? Or does that need specifying?

For calculating CR, I started with a target range, then used the info in the Dungeon Master's Guide to calculate effective AC/HP/damage, but in some instances I had to use guesswork. Unfortunately, I have no way of realistically testing all these creatures (don't even have a group that could do it anyway), so I'm just hoping the math all works out.

"hj7bgyk","&gt;If you're gonna swagger about town, carrying a deadly weapon, you better be clear about the legal limits for both carrying and using it where you are. 

Your characterization of him does not match the reality on video or the testimony of the prosecutor's witnesses as of yesterday.  Kyle went there to help his friends, and everyone brough guns to defend themselves because they are not stupid and saw for several nights what was going on in Kenosha.  Nobody disputes that a gun for self defense in a riot is a bad idea.  Nobody is questioning the several dozen other people who participated in the same actions as Kyle while armed, because only Rosenbaum, Grosskreutz, and the skateboard guy were stupid enough to physically batter a clearly armed young man who knew how to defend himself.  

All the victim blaming in the world won't change the fact that Rittenhouse went there to help his town (hes a U.S. citizen, with manyt ties to Kenosha, so enough about the ""not his state/city"" stuff), and that Rosenbaum attacked him for doing so.  They created the situation knowing full well they were attacking an armed man, and they paid for it.

&gt;I have no doubt that he wanted to help, but good intentions don't erase the fact that he broke the law. He did not have a legal right to carry that weapon for self-protection (too young, not his state, not his property, not his gun), nor did he have the legal right to use it to intimidate/deter others, even those with illegal motives (none of those people did). 

In his opening arguments, the prosecutor clearly said he has no issue with Kyle and others wanting to defend their town.  Note that he is not charging anyone of the dozens of AR-15 armed people that were there.  Nick Black is only being charged with giving Kyle the illegal weapon.  I do not dispute that Kyle should spend time in prison for illegaly carrying a weapon, if the hunting license thing does not apply (I don't know that part of the law, the Judge is mulling it over).

&gt;He must've seen the nature of the crowd, but was too young and inexperienced to process that to the irrational or oppositional personalities who are often attracted to this kind of environment, open carry of weapon is a trigger. It's not his fault that he looks like a kid cosplaying on Halloween, but it's his complete lack of self-awareness, basic safety measures in mob conditions, combined with his decision to break the law that resulted in this situation. The fact that he was calling attention to himself, walking down the street, alone, speaks to the fact that he did not see himself as vulnerable. 

This is a weird spin on the reality.  Kyle Rittenhouse acted more maturely than many trained veteran police officers.  He rendered aid, he put out fires, bravely ran towards danger, and had the calmness of mind to not hurt anyone outside of self defense.  His trigger and barrell control were extremely impressive, despite being concussed by multiple hits to the head.  He stared down the barrel of a gun and could have fired but held because his attacked momentarily disengaged.  Most police would have shot Grosskreutz several seconds before Rittenhouse did.    What really happened was that Rosenbaum and the rest of the mob was immature and unaware of the consequences of their actions.  Life is not a video game where you can just attack an armed man and restart if you fail.  Unfortunately some of them will never learn that lesson.

&gt;but it's his complete lack of self-awareness, basic safety measures in mob conditions, combined with his decision to break the law that resulted in this situation.

Incorrect.  He was merely in the wrong place and wrong time.  Rosenbaum attacking him caused the situation.

"hj2yvg5","Desis get bashed for the racism / classism / sexism that is exhibited by the more traditional or extremist groups -- obviously the average ABCD dude is no more or less ""ist"" than any other group of people, but given that we are an ethnicity with billions of people, both in India and across the world in a huge diaspora, there's always going to be examples to pull from. Additionally, desis do it to themselves all the fucking time, which gives other groups of people permission to do the same. 

When you denigrate and deprecate yourself, you give others permission to do the same. When you joke at your expense or forward your own stereotypes, you encourage others to think similarly. Indians rip each other all day for being sexist, for being racist, for being mama's boys, for being white worshippers, for being bootlickers and race traitors, for being nerds, for being fobs, for being coconuts, for everything. This teaches other people that it's OK to traffic in these stereotypes, jokes, memes, and generalizations. 

Nav is the most bland, boring rapper I've ever heard in my life, but he had a good apology and rationale for his N word usage - which is mainly that he was ignorant and unaware of how offensive the term was, because growing up in his neighborhood, everyone called everyone it. But after realizing his music started to reach audiences beyond his local area, and realizing how offensive the term was, he stopped using it and apologized. That is pretty damn reasonable, and anyone who wants to be mad, I mean, that's their own headache at that point. 

All groups of people have racists. As a generality, sure, the desi community has historical, cultural / religious, and societal problems with all kinds of ""isms"" - classism, racism, colorism, sexism, homophobia. You name it, in a developing nation and diaspora of BILLIONS of people, you're going to have ALL the issues. 

But the reason it is okay for other races to ""punch down"" on desis and stereotype us as all kinds of rapists and creepers and racists and chauvinists is because THEY SEE US DOING IT. Until desis get that through their fat fucking skulls, shit will never get better. 

This does not mean you should not call out sexism or racism when you see it. But when you do, remember the reason that this individual is being sexist or racist... is because they are a fucking asshole. That's it -- it's not because they are indian, it's because they are a piece of shit. A lot of you have family members who are pieces of shit, and you need to remind yourself, look, your dad isn't abusive or manipulative or sexist because he's indian. He's abusive and manipulative and sexist because he's... you guessed it, a piece of shit. 

Some of you are just mad at the world and hate the dice-roll that made you, and you're miserable in your own skin, so you spam shit that revolves around degrading brown folk. You may disguise it under the cover of social justice or calling out issues, but we see what you're doing - you're just trying to feel better by shitting on brown people. But the problem is, these other people looking on, they don't get that you're an individual person with issues. They see you as a brown person and assume your characterization of brown people is accurate, and they buy into that world view, and they participate in it, because you made them think it's OK to see brown people as this generalized, stereotyped monolith. 

In short, we get bashed more because people see us bashing ourselves and think it's acceptable to do the same.",1635897961,"nav is the most bland, boring rapper i've ever heard in my life, but he had a good apology and rationale for his n word usage - which is mainly that he was ignorant and unaware of how offensive the term was, because growing up in his neighborhood, everyone called everyone it.","ignorant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"ignorant and unaware","ignorant",NA,NA,0
"hj1jqx1","Bumped into a girl at my social circles favorite area in town to hang a few months ago. We locked eyes for a couple of seconds as I was getting in my car, but I didn’t want to be a weirdo and chase her down the road. A couple weeks later we recognize each other on tinder and match. We started chatting, I was asymptomatic and unaware of my status at the time. We went on a couple of dates and I clicked with her unlike anyone I’ve met before.

A couple weeks into that my ex comes back around and guilts me into giving us another try, I go for it like an idiot and spend the next month wondering if I’ve finally dug myself into a hole deep enough I’m just going to end up alone forever because I can’t recognize the good ones when I have them. I go along with planning a vacation with the ex anyways.

A day before we are set to leave on vacation I get my first outbreak after being sexually inactive for two years, I took some time to work on myself and man was it worth it. I’m blindsided and afraid, but go on the vacation anyways, being completely open with the girl I was with about what was happening. She really didn’t care, she just wanted me, which would be nice if that was going anywhere besides having mutual security blanket.

Get back from vacation, knowing full well at this point things will never work with my ex because I wasn’t feeling it; but afraid to venture back out now that I know I have HSV2. That’s a big mistake I see others make as well, don’t stay with someone simply because of your HSV status.

I start hanging out with the girl I clicked with, just as a friend. She asks why I disappeared for a month and seem so down. I just straight up tell her, idk what it is about her but I want to tell her everything. She tells me she’s sorry that it happened, but that I shouldn’t let it hold me back or change how I see myself. I heeded that, because it shouldn’t.

We keep hanging out, we get closer, I tell my ex to let go of any hope of us working. I went over every risk involved with us being sexually active as we get inevitably closer to that point and the girl I truly mesh with told me in no uncertain terms she doesn’t care about the risk and sees me, not the hsv. We are now dating, things are great. I haven’t been this happy in years, I’m coming to realize. I take precautions like crazy but she doesn’t seem to worry despite knowing the risk.

All this convoluted story to say that HSV doesn’t change too much about dating at the end of the day and you are perfectly able to find a good match if you are looking.

How hard is this to understand? The point is that posting a CaC pic is extremely unnsignificant. Stop getting hung up on semantics.

&gt;You can do something for fun, but what OP did actually involves other people simply by it being a post on a subreddit.

You scroll through your frontpage. You catch a glimpse of a post you don't care about. You keep scrolling and move on with your day.

This is what thousands of people do everyday. Follow in their footsteps.

&gt;He posted on the sub and got flak for it. He can either try to change his content to better satisfy the people here (granted I think I’m one of the only people who actually suggested using other hairstyles, so there was absolutely a lack of constructive criticism), just not post this content at all because he can enjoy it alone himself (aka he won’t get flak for it), or he can get all uppity and insult people even when the worst they’ve done to him is “your avatar is unoriginal” and respond to his excess hostility.

Or everyone can be considerate? OP posted XV content which is allowed on here. People can choose to engage with it or not. If this post is not for you then just leave. Not everything is going to be tailor-made to you.

"hix3qrj","Everyone else in here is saying that he’s an abuser and he’s trying to isolate you. This may in fact be 100% correct. Based on the prompt, I don’t have enough context to say 100% that he’s an abuser or a serial killer or whatever. 

He may be and that’s nothing to play around with and maybe I am an optimist (which Reddit has done a lot to crush) but it’s possible he really is just that bad. 

Maybe he’s on the spectrum and just does not get things about social interaction.  Only you can determine if you think this is appropriate and for you but if you determine that you are comfortable with it and aren’t at risk, maybe try to talk to him?  

Something along the lines of “hey so and so, you and my sister have been dating for awhile and she seems to really love you and she’s happy and that makes me very happy because I love her, but I also get the vibe sometimes that you don’t really like me. I just want my sister to be happy so, why don’t you like me? Have I ever done anything to offend you?  She is my sister and we will both be in her life for a very long time so I just want to make sure that we get along… for her”

Now I also want to be clear that this may not be true but it’s phrased in the most non confrontational way possible, reaffirming a love that may or may not exist and his emotional effect on her will hopefully disarm him.  If he is jealous of your relationship it will hopefully phrase it as not a competition but a collaboration. If he does actually care for her then it will reinforce that. 

The way he responds to this will tell you a ton. If he is just a clueless idiot who’s really really bad socially he may be surprised and unaware of his behavior, and it will make him aware of it and you can talk it out. If he completely brushes it off and/or tries to gaslight you, that’s a huge red flag.  If he does have an issue maybe he will open up about it and tell you how he feels. And of course if he reacts with any more rudeness or anger then that is just as equally a red flag. 

Only you can determine if this approach is appropriate but I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt without knowing more about who they are or what they’re going through. Maybe he’s struggled his whole life with interpersonal communication, maybe he’s never had anyone question him and this is a teachable moment and the relationship can grow in a healthier direction. Or maybe he is an asshole and a classic abuser. Take this all with a grain of salt from a random Reddit comment, but before we scorched earth, there might be less dramatic paths to take to ease or clarify things. 

I usually look to my cousin and his wife as a point in favor of this. She cheated on him while they were dating. They had been together for years.  It was in college and she would go to parties and get drunk and had on several occasions cheated on him. 

He found out but was like MADLY in love and everyone under the sun told him to break up with her, dump her cheating ass, that it would happen again, etc. etc.  

Well he didn’t. She completely stopped drinking and has been sober for like 10 years. They have 3 beautiful kids together, they by all accounts are happy and super in love and have a wonderful life together.  

I have no idea what his life would be like now if she wasn’t in it but I can’t imagine it being any better. Of course as a family member we regarded her skeptically for YEARS but I’m close enough with them that I can honestly say she’s either the best liar in the world or that was the catalyst she needed to make positive changes in herself. If that trauma was the cost of having the rest of their lives be happy and full of love with 3 beautiful kids… it was probably worth it.",1635794562,"if he is just a clueless idiot who’s really really bad socially he may be surprised and unaware of his behavior, and it will make him aware of it and you can talk it out.","surprised and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"surprised and unaware","surprised",NA,NA,0

"himuxbj","It could be any number of things. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, here is my guess:

It was a passing, flirty comment. People are sexual. They like to tease each other. They always will. In mature adults, it’s not possessive or presumptuous, just testing the waters and learning a little about you by how you react. I really doubt we’ll ever get passed sexuality in professional work environments entirely. You would have to cut away so much of yourself.

I’m a gardener and I work with three women. We don’t have the same sterile concept of professionalism that offices usually adopt to appease the lawyers. There’s more or less some sexuality communicated in any conversation, maybe excepting when something has to be communicated urgently, like “You’re doing that wrong, it needs to be done this way, or we’ll never finish.”

But we are able to easily police each other if the vibe isn’t mutual. We just show disinterest or aversion and it cleans up immediately. It’s punishment enough.

But, I really don’t know the guy you are referring to, or the situation. It could be all sorts of things going on, and you’ve only communicated a single literal sentence without any feeling attached to it. Going conspiracy mode, it could be

1.	He’s a bitter man impulsively flashing cruelty.
2.	He’s misogynistic and takes women being compulsively catty for granted.
3.	Light hearted teasing.
4.	You may be inexperienced socially and became a bit fearful at the uncertainty.
5.	He may be immature and unaware of how unreceptive you were.

Wasn't until college where I met a girl on my floor who was trans that it clicked.

It wasn't an instant click either. I had body image issues through high scho, and for the first time I started connecting all the things that I hated: facial hair, broad shoulders, genitals, ect, and I noticed a pattern emerging. Like many trans people who start to realize that they are trans, I tried doubling down on being a man. Grew out my beard, did typical bro guy stuff. Hated myself for it. Took about 5 years from learning about what transgender is to finally accepting it and starting HRT.

I don't defend any racism, nowhere in my response did I defend racism. I was defending a joke, and this whole situation is hilarious honestly, because people can say over[my racist things and go ""it was just a joke"" and that's totally fine, but someone makes a joke about white chess pieces and suddenly shit goes down and I'm ""what's wrong with the world.""

All of the set pieces are great, and it’s a generally fun movie, even if the story is all over the place trying to do too much at once and not giving enough focus to any one idea.

"hi9a5n6","&gt; Do your research, all the ancient mystery schools and eastern religions like Buddhism and Hinduism acknowledge that you are in a cycle of reincarnation, which you have to find a way to liberate yourself out of it.

Religious dogma drummed into the heads of the religious over millennia isn't evidence of reincarnation being a ""trap"".

According to the research in https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Souls-Studies-Between-Lives/dp/1567184855 by Michael Newton, we repeatedly reincarnate in order to gain experiences and understandings that are chosen to help us grow wiser as Souls.

Reincarnation is a choice we make, and one that we can choose not to repeat. The caveat being that we must complete each incarnation cycle until it ends however it does. And then, as a Soul that recalls why it incarnated, it can choose to plan its next reincarnation, if it deems it necessary.

&gt; I said what I said is the way out because that’s how I have obtained understanding on my true self and what this reality is, I have experienced through deep meditation being an eternal infinite consciousness, I talk about this on my pinned post on r/reincarnationtruth , I also have induced knowledge from this higher consciousness while manifested as it.

Okay... you say this, but your words don't show an actual understanding of your true self or what this reality is. Your post even contradicts this, as you push fear-based dogmatism that does nothing but make people afraid of both death and life. The fear-based belief of thinking that this reality is a soul prison, and that death only causes you to remain trapped if you don't fulfill the super-vague, and thus unobtainable, requirements, only perpetuates the cycle of fear.

It cannot be disproven, even. Anything can be twisted to make it seem like the fear is real. And happily, there is basically not a single shred of good evidence to believe any of it.

Even better, as I've posted, there's evidence showing that death is not to be feared, nor is life.

&gt; Enlightenment is the key, Gnosis is the key, look up Gnosticism and understand it’s principles of self enlightenment, to put it simply it’s first hand experience of the divine, and not blindly following beliefs out of a book by a church establishment.

How hypocritical. You only believe this fear-based ideology because a book told you so! And the book claims that if you do X, Y and Z, you'll be free... despite the fact that the authors of the ideology actually have no evidence for their claims whatsoever.

&gt; I was very lucky to experience what I have experienced, I have had a handful of them which have made me able to connect back to our intrinsic nature.

And yet, bizarrely, you still believe this reality to be a soul trap, something based on fear. Something you haven't actually experienced, and don't actually know is the reality.

&gt; To give you more help, the “higher” self, or how I put it, the “true” self, reside in your metaphysical heart center (spirit), it’s intelligence resides in the heart (love).

Our Higher Self is just our Soul. Or better put, the part of our Soul that didn't incarnate. Only a portion of our Soul incarnates into this physical realm, while the rest exists outside of it. Basically, our incarnate self experiences dissociation from the rest of the Soul. Nevertheless, our Soul experiences quite directly everything that happens to its incarnate aspect. Even while the incarnate aspect that we experience as us is entirely ignorant and unaware of our Soul. That is why our Higher Self, our Self, appears to be distinct from us.

&gt; Love, when anyone who was truly awakened, would teach it as the ultimate principle if you truly understood what it was, the word “Love” was the name of / denoted to the guiding intelligence of the true self (god). It is the natural order, the natural expression, the natural manifestation of god. It is gods intrinsic way of being.

&gt; If you are of the natural order of god (you are following / manifesting energy of this guiding intelligence of the true self), that is when you embody the products of it, like compassion, affection, happiness, caring, immense connection to others, peace, euphoria, kindness, etc

&gt; This intelligence is where you can know things intuitively if you are connected with it, all through deep meditation and tuning with the source of our consciousness

Finally, something I can agree with.

If you believe all of that, why do you believe in such a profoundly fear-inducing ideology whose goal seems to be little more than a form of fear-based mind control?

Fear-based mind control that claims that unseen entities have trapped Souls in a world of ignorance, wiping their memories every reincarnation, and keep us trapped in fear, so we can never escape, while they feed on our fear?

&gt; A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position.

Things that cause trauma and death are terrible. But seeing people live through their own decay, slowly turning into vegetables over a period of years while still conscious, haunts me much more.

I've seen cases of very advanced Alzheimer's where the victim is terrified and unaware of where he/she even is (even when reminded every couple of minutes), severe brain damage to the point of turning people into blank-eyed animals, grown men's diapers being changed, an ancient woman who babbled and screamed nonsense words with a deformed tongue and passionate intensity, others who suffered through series of strokes that progressively took away more of themselves, and many others who had lost everything that once made them who they were. There were not many visits from family to that place.

The pain and suffering that these elderly go through at the end of life continues for years as they progressively fall apart. And death, when it finally comes, is generally not some peaceful hospital bed surrounded by friends and family. These people usually die alone, hooked up to machines, and if they still have any consciousness at all, it is full of confusion and fear.

All of this is pretty good reason for an advance healthcare directive, IMO.

She believes saying a particular word is against her faith. Ted didn’t just say the word himself - he put her in a position where she had to say that word, on a regular basis, in direct conflict with her personal beliefs. And he insisted on doing it even after she explained how it affected her.

She tried to find a way around it, and her friends then complained about that solution. They all believe she should just ‘get over’ her personal issues because they don’t share them. 

This was never a case of ‘someone said something I found offensive and I wouldn’t let it go.’

I appreciate your sentiments, but I still believe you are wrong, and unaware of how your opinion is coloured by the religious aspect. Your stance - that people should suck it up and let things go, even when those things occur in what should be safe spaces and are perpetrated by people who have been educated about them - runs counter to most civil rights movements and is very outdated. The fact that you, personally, are happy to let some things go does not mean anyone else should follow suit. To use your own words - ‘the world does not revolve around you’, and it is not your job to set the line others should walk by.

Also…I never resorted to ad hominem attacks. Ad hominem means attacking the writer of an argument in a way that ignores the central point of the argument.

"hhu1pkh","A TL;DR can be found in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuseInterrupted/comments/px2gst/the_revenge_that_feels_best_is_actually_no/hellppi/) where I touch on this structure:

**Interestingly, my favorite expression of the growth journey is actually found in the suite of cups in the tarot.**

The five of cups is the card of loss and grief, and is usually depicted as a person who has lost three of their five cups and they are grief-stricken and heartbroken.  The six of cups typically represents nostalgia and looking back, thinking about happier times especially when we were innocent and unaware of pain.  The seven of cups is being presented with so many cups that you can't choose them all, stuck in dreaming of what could be.  The eight of cups sees a person walking away - *walking away* - from ALL of the cups in search of the truth.  They've let go of trying to hold on, and say ""fuck it"".  And then we come to the nine of cups, which is typically emotional fulfillment.  

**By walking away, by letting go, by searching for the truth, by being grounded in ourselves and turning inward to fulfill ourselves and fill our own cup, we find what we were looking for all along.**

It's the four and five of cups I find particularly interesting.  The four of cups is depicted as a person who who is dissatisfied and unhappy, they are looking at their three cups and so disappointed that they can't even see the fourth cup they are being offered.  The five of cups always shows two upright cups that the person doesn't see because they are so focused on the cups they have lost.

**Now if you are coming from a law of attraction paradigm, you might say that you could 'manifest' what you want by 'raising your vibration'**

...and focusing on the two cups you still have in the five of cups, or the one cup you are being offered in the four of cups.  But really, the journey *isn't* about holding on to the cups at all.  While recognizing and paying attention to what you have is a positive thing, it isn't a silver bullet.  The cups show *a journey* to a place where it doesn't matter about what cups we are offered and have because we have learned to fill our own cup.

**So instead of looking to others for emotional fulfillment, we come to a place where we are our *own* emotional fulfillment.**

But it's a journey, it isn't something we are compelled to do the instant we feel loss and pain or anger.  We can know the direction and respect the process it takes to get there, and then when we look back on the journey, we have so much that can't be taken from us by anyone.

**No one else can take from us what we have learned**

...can take our experience and history, our pride in overcoming obstacles and of triumphing in horrible circumstances.  We weren't victims of a holocaust, but childhood victims of abuse experienced years of torture (intended or not) at the hands of the very people who were supposed to love us.  The very people we loved so hopefully and desperately.  

**We survived, we endured**

...and no one can take the truth of our experience away from us; no one can take our strength or our heartbreak; no one can live our life or experience our journey.  It is ours, and we get to learn and make mistakes and feel our feelings and try different things and do our best and do our worst.  It is our life, our heart, our mind, our beliefs.

"hht2lb9","&gt;I appreciate this very much. I’ve learned at times when ideas hit home, sometimes me responding at length obscures the ideas that were said. So in that sense, I actually read, felt validated, and don’t know if I have much to say. Only just a good feeling toward a lot of that. I have Jewish blood in me but I’ve very clearly taken a non-faith based path once I reached my mature self as it is today. I’m not sure how to regard my religion yet, or ideas of how I may be protected by God, but that aside, my entire existence as of late has been purely of the directly experiencing nature. And it’s so good to hear that you’ve experienced similar things. I am constantly reminded of the agony that is occurring all around me. I would go far as to say when I fully lose context of what I am and where I am (as in, I know it’s called the world, a floating planet in space, but the feeling when I realize there’s no actual context or end to the confusion I feel when I try to think about what I am) and the subsequent confusion and terror ensues, I think very much in the background is the awareness of just how bad things are for people all across this place we live. I sometimes cannot shift into bliss for this very reason. The closer I get to what may be looked at as truth from a dhammic (am I saying that right) standpoint, where I feel to not exist in the sense I thought I once did, is the recognition of those still feeling very much to be existing and unaware of this other place we may reach or reside, and how they just don’t know there’s something else to this all. My mind and body hurts for them, but I also feel isolated knowing few people understand. Because I’m hurting too. I’m psychologically damaged by this path, it’s just true. I want to believe it was all for something, but sometimes I doubt it so much I feel I’m being toyed with or punished for trying to have a divine realization. I’m defeated and scared right now.

I have been at a similar place, able to see some of the way of things, but still frustrated, maddened by the things you have listed- lovingkindness was experienced as a *painful* sensation because of the sheer magnitude of sorrows perceived. 

To the eye without filtering lenses, the Sun is a blinding and painful thing. Having the ability to cock your head back and look directly at it doesn't mean it won't immediately induce pain, unfortunately.

&gt;I can vibe with what you mean to cut someone a break for their honest opinion. They (the other commenter) were very gracious in apologizing for communicating in a way that didn’t resonate with me. I kind of knew it would happen though. That’s why in my original post I said I’m fearful of what responses I’m going to get - that fear was very specifically, based on prior readings or posting here, was more me dreading the inevitable commentary that what I’m experiencing is either not true, only a beginners stage, or at the mind-level, implying it’s not significant. That’s why I made sure to say I’m not making any claims here about where I stand. I just dislike this idea that everything has to be interpreted as what stage you’re at. I do not like posting in [r/awakened](https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened) anymore because it’s gotten so cliche - someone would say, yes, this is the dark night of the soul, or something about how it “sounds.” I prefer not to think in terms of this one-way trajectory although I can understand how even in Buddhism there still is the idea of stages and I see some validity in it, but sometimes things just don’t fit any model. 

It may be of worth for you if I note here that ""Buddhism"" is a broad umbrella, and further, not everyone pursuing nibbana even calls themselves such. There are multiple larger and smaller sects, various areas of harmony and discord within doctrine.

There are many concepts discussed through other routes and disciplines that independently arrive at similar conclusions to the dhamma, as well, though the specific and exact higher attainments are unique to the dhammic approach, the others very much are not- some of the early chiefest monks had high attainments and abilities from *other* disciplines before becoming arahants. You won't find the *end* of suffering anywhere else, but you find a *lot* of the broad strokes realized again and again across cultures, traditions, and disciplines.

""Things not fitting the model"" is an inherent feature of reality. Models and maps are translations of one or multiple people's experience of A Phenomenon, rendered in words, then rendered *back* from words into mind-moments by other, different brains.

&gt;Thanks for your ideas. I’m not sure Buddhism is for me, because of its rigidity, but I also recognize I haven’t had that pure awareness of non-duality - although have come close, I mean who knows maybe I have? Idk. I can’t tell if I’m doubting myself or lying to myself, I hate it (although I’ve had other types of phenomena) so I get why it can be seen as a path with a start and end. It used to feel good now it doesn’t.

I didn't come to Buddhism as an upset person in need of relief. Rather, I found Gautama's words well *after* experiencing some extraordinary things as a result of independent meditation and focus with the goal of becoming free of my pain, realizing how He was discussing things *very* much in line with my experience, and deciding to continue on taking things at face value.

The reason I say this is to dispel the idea that clinging to a specific path in your mind beforehand, a certain expectation of how things will go, or *must* be- is permanent. There is no other way to state this, than to be quite honest that one day there was doubt and confusion and questions, and another there *wasn't.* 

So, from my view, I'm not preaching a specific dogma or stating you must do this or that, merely attesting to what has taken place and on whose good advice :)

To me, the Eightfold Path is anything *but* rigid or confining. It demands only of you those things which ultimately better yourself in a tangible, real-world way.

&gt;I deleted my post just so I don’t have to deal with the anger I would feel if someone told me again I was just dissociating or if someone made a judgement on how I’m some beginner. I just don’t care for judging attainment anymore. All I know is things get weird. I like weird sometimes but sometimes I have been suicidal and felt schizophrenic. Even though schizophrenia runs in my family, lots of what I experience was a direct result of observing my mind and surroundings. There’s no going back now, it makes me fearful. I want to cling to things like spirits and deities now more than ever but deep down I only sometimes believe in them. I can’t feel them there for the life of me. It’s very isolating to completely lose all sense of an identity while also being filled with adrenaline. 

This reads not dissimilar to a journal entry I could have written myself. The vacillation between awareness of Things Bigger, and a total void of belief. The extreme swings of adrenaline that seemingly leave nothing in their wake. It doesn't have to be a permanent state.

&gt;I don’t even have faith or trust in the Buddha. I wish I did. I wanted this path but I’m not sure my personality type jives with it now. It’s so funny, now I want to believe in God. I’m scared. But I just have to reiterate it’s not like I had, what my one friend who annoys me says, was a shattering of mind and now fear to overcome before bliss. That’s almost fallacy in its linearity. I’ve been up and down and all around. And any happiness that may come gets shot down when I think of all the threats that exist in the world.

""Now I *want* to believe in God"" sounds familiar, as well. Wishing someone existed who could bail you out of what you've thought your way into is a place I know intimately. I was what could be charitably referred to as *recalcitrantly faithless*, always treating the advice of the wise with respect, but never able to trust any of it on words alone.

How fortunate for the both of us that direct experience is the whole point, and all the faith in the world won't get you there. Of course a certain *degree* of trust in the process and that it can actually work is needed, but this is *not* the same thing as the near-mythological inspired Faith of Western myths. 

If the whole thing was *just* people sincerely believing in things, then it would all be a lie and without a purpose. Be as skeptical as you like, if you pursue the path in spite of it, the results will arrive all the same and eventually erase said skeptcism.

&gt; No, that's not what I said. I said that science is a better tool for discovering how the universe works than philosophy. I never argued that science does everything that philosophy does, just better. I'm sure there are areas of philosophy that science doesn't cover and vice-versa.

"hhdm04w","What I’m saying is that it’s fine to praise the founders for setting a liberal democracy, but it’s not okay to brush their flaws under the rug because they set up a liberal democracy. They had flaws, and historians are honest about those flaws. 

They absolutely could have outlawed slavery, which at the time was in decline, but they were too afraid to lose souther slave state support for the Revolution.  They could have offered a compensated emancipation for in return for revolutionary support, but they didn’t. 

Abolition was not that radical. And no, it wasn’t “conservative Christians” who led the fight for abolition. It was the radical progressive Christians. Abolition, while not that outside the norm, was still a progressive position at the point. It progressed society away from the conservative norm. 

Thaddeus Stevens, the most radical of the Radical Republicans, was a progressive, not a conservative. 

When did I disparage the government the founders set up? I didn’t. I just refuse to put them on pedestal because they did that. They still had flaws, and the ethical duty of historians is to be honest about both the good and the bad, but the 1776 Report ignores or defends the bad. That’s not good history, that’s just hero-worship.

Take for instance, one of my historical heroes: Ulysses S. Grant. Great general (literally one of the best of all time), the first president to defend and promote the civil rights of the now freed black population of America, destroyed the first incarnation of the KKK through the establishment of the justice department. He was also painfully naive and unaware of the intentions of others. People took advantage of that which led to a very corrupt presidential admin, run by a very non corrupt president. The continuation of the Indian Wars under his presidency also is a black mark his book. It’s entirely possible to praise and critique in equal measure. 

I have read the 1776 Report. All 40-some odd pages of it. It’s a work lacking in historical detail and honesty and dismisses or ignores any criticism that makes America not look squeaky clean.  Fuck that. That’s not honesty. America is a great nation, but it’s not without its faults.

"hhaxx2f","Take my award and I have a couple of question in the replies below.

&amp;#x200B;

SCREEN. PROTECTOR. Cannot emphasize enough. Go cheap, go expensive, doesn't matter. ANYTHING is better than a ruined screen. - **Ok, will deffo get this.**
  

  
Flex plate - contentious. If you build flat on the plate it's amazing. If you always use a raft+supports it's pointless. Still have to clean the mating surfaces before adding plate back or the resin between them will act as a lube and allow slop and layer lines. Much much easier to separate large footprint objects by bending the plate. **I looked at these. Maybe not for me right now**
  

  
Air filter: factory elegoo ones are okay, but very very limited lifespan on the cartridges. Print a little holder to fill with aquarium carbon for cheap. **I got the Elagoo ones and I run a HEPA filter right next to it. Love the idea of making a box for aquarium carbon, any idea where I can get the plans?**
  

  
Optionally, print a ventilation gasket that lets a fan actually exhaust the inside of the machine through a big big filter or outdoors. Fits between machine and lid, meaning you don't have to modify either to get airflow while maintaining a seal. **Would love to do this. Not conducive to where I have the printer as I would like the air going outside.**
  

  
Lid handle/hook to store while working on the machine
  

  
Lid lift - like a plant suspension retracting reel so the lid is always balanced above the machine - **Like this**
  

  
build plate drip adapter - holds the plate at a 45º and 5º compound angle so the plate will drip 'cleaner' and save you on resin and alcohol - **Deffo on the list**
  

  
Fully mod the lid to have a door - somewhat incompatible with the drip adapter as you need the lid off or the part may bump into the lid when rotated.
  

  
Probably a good idea to add a filter to the air intake. Internals are optically important and covering them with years of dust, particularly the led and lens array will reduce effectiveness. Doesn't need to be hyper hepa - just any sort of fine mesh screen like a computer would use to cut dust on the intake - **I use a CPAP - I think the little filters that go in my machine would be perfect.**
  

  
I love using resinator3d the program to let me upload via network, print, and monitor prints since my print room is on a different floor as my computer. Alternately you can add a pi internally by soldering it in where it will essentially have a web interface directly to the printer and take over a bunch of functions. Somewhat intrusive but faster, more powerful, and gooder. I haven't done this but many people swear by it - especially in a farm setting. Caution: the machine is dumb and unaware of its own preparedness to print. It WILL allow you to start a print remotely while the old print is still on the bed, gleefully ploughing the old print into the screen during 'homing', probably destroying both. **This is a deffo must. Thanks!**
  

  
Resin tank pour spout - clips on the edge to allow pouring resin back into bottle without dripping as much down the edge. **I need this 100%, any idea where i can get one in the US?**
  

  
Resin refill gadget - like a gerbil water feeder...when the level drops it allows a siphon drip into the tank. I don't have one but could see it being useful for those ""I can't tend to the printer for &gt;15 hours and this is a 1 litre print"" situations. Super rare but useful. **This is a good one. Will look into this.**
  

  
uninterruptible power supply - nothing like a power bump to ruin a day long print. printer is fairly low power, 100w max, average well below 20 watts because of the light on/off. Even a tiny one would be able to keep you going for an extended outage. **Something to consider.**
  

  
better (but not necessarily bigger or faster) usb 2.0 stick. Get a reliable brand usb 2.0. 3.0++ can draw too much power and crash some printers.

Honestly this is such a privileged take from someone who had probably, already, successfully gotten an online job when this was posted. I fully understand that on subs like this, hundreds of people will post the same obvious question, even with a mega-thread pinned to the top of the sub. But I and many others have done all the things that “ain’t exactly rocket science” like “going to a job engine site”, having certifications and or taking courses, having experience in the field or even a degree, applying, doing hours long qualification tests, and interviewing, just to not even get a reply back saying we didn’t get the position. Many of which applied to a similar position in person and they got the job. 

Yes I’m sure many people come on here just asking what can I do, just expecting a simple answer without doing even a Google search by themselves. But many people, myself included, want to know what companies have actually hired you, what sites we should avoid, lesser known tips, ways they filter out candidates, or even specific jobs that aren’t very common, that may fit us very well. Not to mention those who may be older or less inclined to the internet, especially with such a new thing as working online, and simply don’t know where to begin. And telling them do the obvious thing like go on job sites or take courses, just to be sarcastic and ironic towards the few people that come on here without putting in any thought, isn’t helping anyone. Especially when you posted it in a format that seemed like it could actually be helpful for the people who really need it. 

It honestly comes off as extremely privileged, and unaware of how things actually are for most people. Like can we address how ridiculous it is that we’re supposed to spend hundreds out of our own pocket (or at the very least our time) on courses, on very specific skills, for the OPPORTUNITY to get a job. For the certificate to prove we’re certified or have experience, on something that can easily be trained or that most people can pick up  on their own. Where they still may not even respond to you, let alone hire you. And the people that come here wondering why this may be happening, (even though they aren’t being “lazy” ) and want to know ways to combat this, from people that may have succeed in the past. Get treated with a post like this pinned to the top of the sub? No wonder trying to find a job online is so bad, people with zero human empathy, and common sense, like you, are the ones behind the desk, already secured in their future, making these comments about “lazy” people, and deciding wether they’re worthy for a barely livable wage position, that still could be the difference between being homeless and having food on the table.",1634626558,"it honestly comes off as extremely privileged, and unaware of how things actually are for most people.","privileged, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"extremely privileged , and unaware","privileged",NA,"extremely",0

I see both sides;

- Is it shitty for OP to just ghost someone they're out with at a bar/club when that person gets too drunk ? Yes.

But;

- Unless you're a 17 year old girl, you should know your limits and exhibit some self control. It's nobodys job to babysit your sloshed ass, or try to coral you all night whilst you're probably being obnoxious and unaware of the situation you are putting others in. 

Id say every situation is different;

- Out with a friend who knowingly has too much and even though is wasted, is still civil and asks for you to get them home?  No problem.

- Or how about you are out with someone who just got dumped or fired or something else serious is happening and they just take it a few drinks too far ? I'll hang in there and try to help em out, atleast make sure they get in an Uber or something to get home.

"hh4t83r","&gt;So God shouldn’t have Free Will? To do everything as He wishes? To make His own choices?

God has a responsibility to the things he’s created to treat them fairly. Unless God intended to create a dollhouse, I suppose, but who wants to watch stories about a dollhouse?

&gt;You are the one who said that they don’t have it.

Because they don’t. I object to the idea of it staying that way and hoped to see the show address that by allowing characters to start diverging from God’s plan, but the show had other plans and decided to settle on a ‚it’s not bad that God has a plan, because he means well’ moral. It then bends itself into a pretzel to claim that God having a plan he actively enforces and free will can exist in the same universe.

&gt;Isn’t he using a power people can’t say no to? 

Yes, Lucifer’s power is a violation of consent and free will, and he probably shouldn’t use it.

You could do a lot of things, but if you’re as emotionally stunted and unaware of how to take care of people other than yourself as Lucifer is at the start of the series, it makes sense that you wouldn’t know how to.

If you hate bringing grief to someone else, that means you care about that person’s feelings. 

&gt;BTW, how often did he mentioned her after her death?

The fact the show forgets about Delilah to the point it starts claiming Chloe is the first person he ever cared about doesn’t mean that Lucifer isn’t shown to care about Delilah in episode one.

"hgtv4xl","I have a long post, but please read it to the end. I say some very important things here that most people won't ever consider, and you need to consider them before you take action in any way.

Depending on the severity of his autism, he might not understand boundaries or anything beyond wants/needs of his. He might not realize this hurts you. It could just be literally a sensory thing for him. Don't take it personally, but he's likely unable to process why he even does this, it's just pheromones and... well, basically primal instinct, and sensory overload a lot of times. He likely doesn't have impulse control because he doesn't know what impulse is. He also might not have taken them for the reasons you assume, which I will explain at the bottom of my post.

I've worked with people with autism who literally have ran into traffic and got hit by cars because they don't exist outside of their often very narrow focus.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't ever be able to separate the private nature of your boundaries being broken from the fact that he likely doesn't know what boundaries are, and be fully okay with it, but you can see from his perspective and forgive him for it, even if it won't ever feel not gross.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how true this is, he could have mild autism and just be a real creepy man and choose to break these boundaries, but the only thing that can be said for a certainty, is that it won't stop unless someone shows him it's wrong and breaks his behavior so that it is redirected in a healthy way or becomes a learned behavior to not touch or take things, which is not something you can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I'll leave you with this perspective. Your boyfriend, his brother, is non-autistic I assume, and is deemed ""normal"", right? Well, his brother has a girlfriend, who gets to come over and spend time with him and touch him and be intimate with him, and has a bunch of friends and close relationships where they can just sleep together in the living room and be people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does he get that? Has he ever hugged anyone who wasn't a family member, or held their hand, or gotten praise, or had them come over to watch TV with him or hangout with him, or do anything with him? Has a girl ever given him any attention? I doubt it, and if it is, it is very rare. But he sees his brother get everything while he gets nothing and he likely isn't aware that he is different, and he doesn't know why he can't have these things. I don't know why he can't have these things, he deserves them and desires them just as much as anyone else in the world, but people rarely prioritize making sure people like him get fulfilling relationships in their lives. He won't ever have a deep connection like his brother has, even if he has the same desires. He'll never be able to articulate any of this to anyone, and nobody cares enough about him, or understands his needs enough to take the time to make sure his life is fulfilling. This is more so true for people who are nonverbal, but it is also true for people who can't process their needs to verbalize them, and who often get overlooked for being creepy and weird and unaware of the boundaries ""normal"" people have.

&amp;#x200B;

You cared about his brother enough to take his underwear and pajamas, because that's something you can do without anyone batting an eye. He did the same thing, and it was wrong. He likely won't ever understand why you could take the clothes of someone you care about, but he couldn't. Think about this before you punish him thinking he doesn't understand, because it is likely you that doesn't understand. 

If you want to know what to do, be his friend. Welcome him into your life and be non-judgemental and don't ever assume that his behaviors are wrong in his world, and that he is doing these things knowing they are wrong. Politely tell him when he does something he shouldn't by saying ""that's not okay"" in the moment, and redirect him to something that is okay.

A non-gendered shirt, if you don't have one buy one and wear it for a while. You can wash it after, it doesn't have to be dirty or anything, just something of yours. Find your underwear wherever he stashed it. Ask him for it. Bring a second pair of underwear if you don't think he will understand. Show him them and say you need yours back, that they are yours.

"hgr02sy","As I stated if you NEED to stay home something is most likely not going right in your life.

You have biological urges and if staying home is way better than being out exploring the world, something is not quite right.

I went through the same thing. I've already gone through the burnout and sorted out my mental health issues. I was an introverted social butterfly, then preferred being home and alone a lot for several years. 

I was diabetic and unaware of it. I've reversed a lot of the damage. At one point I was 384lbs, now I am 205lbs. I am also showing signs of rheumatoid arthritis, which now all the pain is gone.

Essentially my dietary choices were causing me health problems that was including mental problems I was completely unaware at first.

We are design to survive. If we are hiding from life and it feels great something is off.

There are studies all over the world popping up about gut microbiomes and what toxins and vitamins / mineral deficiencies may be causing.

For instance I was reading a study where they suspect that a vitamin b12 deficiency may be link to the trigger of schizophrenia. Almost all off the autoimmune communities have research suggesting that the start of the illness may be in the stomach with the microbiology being thrown off.

People all over the world making statements about ""it took a few years of learning how to eat bot now I now long have lupus flare-ups"" or ""no more MS flare-ups"". I have even seen people say eating cleaner caused their autism to go away.

1 year ago I took that knowledge and started figuring it out. Everything those people were saying seems to be true to me. I'm not longer hiding at home burnt out and all of my autistic like characteristics are currently gone.

I can bring it all back though. I just need to go back to eating the typical North American diet of take out and pre-packaged store food.

Sometimes just eating a little bit too much of a thing we like or not enough of a type of food is enough to send a person down a mental health spiral.

This past weekend I did a 72 hour fast. I researched it heavily before I did it do I did not make any mistakes. It can harm you if done wrong. After 72 hours so many of my current issues went away and I saw some major improvements like my brain feels 20 years younger and my good memory from when I was younger seems to be firing again.

All from detoxing from foods.

Humans need prebiotic foods and probiotic foods to keep their stomachs healthy. We also need to do things like chew our food ample to make it easier to digest, failing to do so allows larger pieces of food to get into your digestive track and your immune system will temporarily attack it until its gone because it's trying to leak into your body.

So when we toss our stomach health off in any capacity it puts us at risk for either not feeling well temporarily, or having mental health / cognitive decline issues. These are only temporary, unless you abuse your body like I did. Then they become long term issues.

Just start googling terms like gut microbiome or leaky gut syndrome with other terms like lupus, autism, diabetes, mental health.

The fact that you didn't fight back harder says NOTHING about your strength as a woman or a human. People experience wide varieties of emotions and sensations during assault. TRIGGER WARNING: Speaking personally,&gt;! I went back and forth between feeling completely numb and unaware of what was happening, and feeling completely frozen while being totally aware of what was happening. In one instance my brain would be screaming at my arms and legs to ""fight back"", but my limbs wouldn't move. In the next instance I was dissociating totally and had no thoughts other than a dull and muted ""When will this be over"".!&lt;I didn't fight back. It didn't mean that I was weak, and it doesn't mean that for you. 

I'll add another endorsement for RAINN if you're in the US. Not only can they get you in contact with centers that can provide Plan B free of charge, their staff are trained advocates who's primary jobs are to LISTEN to you free of judgement, provide you with options, and help you navigate those options whatever they may be. The options range in everything from getting a rape kit done at a hospital, to reporting to the police, to importantly, doing NOTHING. I know a lot of people here are telling you to file a police report, and you absolutely should if that's what you feel comfortable doing. But many people chose not to report for a multitude of reasons, and an advocate will sit with you in that decision as well. If all you want is to get Plan B and talk through your experience, RAINN will do that for you. I will say that their staff need to follow state reporting laws, which usually means that they would be mandated to make a report if they think that you are planning on harming yourself or another. 

Also, (and someone please correct me if I'm wrong) but I know that in some states, RAINN has connections with organizations that will try to send a licensed advocate to be with you should you choose to report to the police. Sometimes that advocate can also be available to be with you through any subsequent court cases should those come up. I don't know how/if that's changed to follow COVID protocols. 

Last thing - the gross feeling. That's independent to every person. The best thing I can recommend is finding a therapist, ideally one who specializes in trauma. Your road ahead, emotionally, will likely be unpredictable. The gross feeling may not dissipate for a long while. It may come and go in waves both large and small. There may be stretches of time - years, months, weeks, days, or even minutes - where you feel as though you can go about your ""normal"" life, and there may be stretches of time where the gross feeling and the memory of what happened seem entirely inescapable. All of this is normal, as far as we can define what normal is with regard to trauma responses. A good therapist will provide you with tools to confront and/or reframe your responses to the unpredictable. 

I know money may be an issue for you, but there are plenty of resources for free online counseling out there. I haven't used the free ones myself, but I'm sure someone who has can attest to their experience and give a recommendation.

Hard disagree. People voluntarily saying hurtful things on purpose know they have said hurtful things even if they never see the other person apart from that millisecond.

"hgf0g00","Fallout 1 &amp; 2 are pretty old isometric turn based cRPGs which are clunky to play now (they were already old and clunky when I played them around something like 2005), though they are absolutely drenched in amazing atmosphere. They are two separate though connected stories set years apart.

Fallout 3 was when Bethesda took over, and while I love their Elder Scrolls games, I didn't think they translated it well to Fallout. Their world was just too cheerful and unaware of anything having changed with the bombs having dropped (the first games were about brutal cults and gangs and mutations and water caravans and military survivors etc, in Fallout 3 if those appear they're just like a theme park sight-seeing attraction).

Fallout New Vegas was made by some of the original creators of 1 &amp; 2 afaik, using the engine of Fallout 3. It starts very slow and originally I gave up early on, however once you get past the slow part at the start where you're sort of wandering through wilderness and ruins as a kind of tutorial, it suddenly opens up into some amazing story about post-apocalyptic civilizations and factions which nails that sense of seriousness that Fallout 3 lacked.

I recently played Fallout 4, again made by Bethesda, and while it has a lot of flaws, it's a huge step up from Fallout 3 and feels closer to the originals. One of the worst things about it is that they have a 'backup' faction in case you screw things up with all the major story factions (it's got more possible game endings which eliminate huge chunks of the map than any other RPG I can ever remember playing). That backup faction is super weakly written and basically just fetch quests, but it's the first that people encounter so people misjudged a lot of the game's writing by thinking it was only like that, when in truth it does get pretty good. The map design is a bit of a boring sprawl without much rhyme or reason to it, but it's a very fun adventure since just about everything you pick up is useful for their new settlement building system.

It is NOT POSSIBLE to be in the wrong body - that's a cult/religious/woo-woo/metaphysical pile of bullshit.

"hg2q5gh","Yes, but I think i never persued the right girls. From now on I will make sure to do so. I don't think the right girl for me will be one of those perfect shinny ones you see at school that always had a normal, healthy life. 

To me it will probably be one that had a more difficult life but is also conscientious and working on it.

I did persue a girl at school that I joined two years ago that was not right at all. She obviously had traumas and wasn't the best person. I was also a bit socially retarded still. I made a dumb comment on her decision of not wearing a bra that day, which she over reacted to and decided to tell a bunch of people while exaggerating the facts. 

For a while girls in my class thought I was creepy until most of them started noticing the great changes in me, not only physically but in maturity and mentally and that reputation pretty much died out. 

Much more recently, about 3 months ago, when I was coming back home from a night out a girl approached me asking for a cigarette. I fancied her irish accent and attitude and asked for her insta after a bit of banter. We went out 2 nights and on the second one some things went badly. She was tripping on a drug and to calm her down I was kissing her, talking to her and hugging her. I kept her tight in my arms without letting her move much because I noticed it made her feel that much more secure. Anyays a group of dumb, woke thugs accused me of drugging her and tried to rape her, took her away from me, beat me up and stole my pouch with my money. I woke up with a bloody nose with her calling me (luckily they didn't steal my phone) apparently they left her alone and unaware of her surroundings. We met up and in the heat of the moment I naively let out that ""yes I did want to have sex with you but I would never do it with you in that state"" which after me insisting she explained she said she didn't like. 

I don't think it's a fair or intelligent reason but I'm sure it wasn't the only one. 

We liked eachother but either she didn't like me as anything more than friends, or she didn't like me being direct like that or is the type of girl that doesn't like fuck boys and saw me saying I would liked to have sex with her that night as being a fuckboy.

I messaged her again for the first time today actually. Just because I want to see how that'll go. Anyways I see this girl at the gym which I gave a few tips to which is all smiles towards me. At the end of her session she came to me thanking me for the tips. I'll try to talk more to her.

"hfuit8l","Sure, when a person in a car accident becomes so dependent on my body for survival as a result that they literally leach calcium from my bones and redirect the flow of my blood vessels to feed themselves, and there is no way to separate us without killing them for months, I would be legally justified in having them surgically removed from my body.  Next time that happens, post a news article and we can discuss it.

Also, I’m not reducing women to incubators by using the shortest term that effectively means “people can become pregnant,” which just gets unwieldy. (Yes, there are uterus-havers who can’t become pregnant.  But most of those could become pregnant once or will be able to someday, so the removal of the agency of pregnant people by the state is really aimed at their personhood, too.  And I have more of a problem with language that overexcludes than language that overincludes. Basically, saying “people who share this body part,” rather than “women,” reminds people like you that it’s not just women who get pregnant.  “Females” or “biological women” excludes a not-insignificant number of people who can become pregnant, and if you don’t understand why, Google is available.  

You’re right.  As of now, abortion is still legal, so no one’s going to punish me for having sex.  But It’s pretty clear PLs want to.  When you say people have sex “recklessly and without regard for anyone else,” do you mean “some people don’t use birth control” or “some people have sex when they don’t want a child”?  You could easily mean either, and they are completely different discussions.  I didn’t say promoting abstinence was ineffective while arguing it’s a punishment, though there is no inherent contradiction in saying that.  I said promoting abstinence is ineffective AND a lot of PLs seem to think of pregnancy as a punishment, both of which are true.

I don't think it would be unreasonable to try and take him to couples counseling and talk with a professional and try to come to a better place with a licensed neutral party on everything. I know you said he's resistant and unaware of how unwell he's become but I think if you try to use the approach of not doing well and needing him to have a professional outside party that can help him and take the stress off of you, it'll help your relationship thrive. I'm not sure if he'll understand without a lot of effort but I do hope he does come to understand.

I also hope talking about how you've felt through rock bottom and now enduring this situation and the teeny bean you're carrying and the lack of support and empathy from him and how emotionally isolating it is will help.

I think a big thing is learning to use neutral but affirming language and phrasing so he hears that your feelings and desires do not invalidate or assign judgements to his may help along with using similar language to assure him he's heard and you appreciate his honesty even if it doesn't feel fantastic to hear. I think a lot of it may help him feel like there's strength building.


Try offering an avenue for strength building and trying to give him the option to commit to building new methods and give the pregnancy a chance vs abandoning you to full responsibility is worth putting out as an option.

It's unfortunate because his consent matters as much as yours in regards to having a child but... I feel like he threw away his respect for things by refusing to try pulling out and telling you to take care of it. I really don't think you should pursue an abortion without explaining things and trying to mediate in couples therapy and your own personal sessions with your therapist. I don't personally feel like you should get an abortion because I can understand how much it means to you and I know I wouldn't be able to give it up either if I were in that situation.

Calling your kid her baby is annoying, and she won't stop unless you tell her to. Just remember it's not a plot to steal your kid, it's probably just being overly excited and unaware of boundaries. I am not saying she's right in doing so and you should allow it (at all!), just that this behavior alone isn't proof she is the devil incarnated, nor should be enough to make you so mad that you don't let her babysit in my opinion.  


And an offer to babysit isn't outrageous nor an offense, it's nice, as long as she respects your answer. ""We don't need anyone babysitting yet but if we need you, we will let you know"" will work fine as an answer. If she  insists too much, you can either keep denying or be blunt, and tell her that you need to trust whoever stays with your kid to respect your wishes, and she isn't showing she will right now, which makes you wary and less inclined to saying yes.  


If you don't know if you can trust her or not, start small - let her take care of the baby while you make yourself a sandwich or work on something in the house to see how she acts. Having someone you can trust and that loves your baby giving you a few hours to yourself and your husband can be great, after your baby is old enough for it, of course.   


And, if she has showed other behavior that makes you not want to babysit at all, just ""no, thank you"" as an answer would be enough - you don't need to explain to her why, just repeat ""we don't need it"" and ""no, thank you"" over and over.",1633524667,"just remember it's not a plot to steal your kid, it's probably just being overly excited and unaware of boundaries.","excited and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"overly excited and unaware","excited",NA,"overly",0

That's an interesting argument.

Since most people don't know what executive function is, I think it's entirely fair to to report this finding as ""readiness to learn"" to a lay audience, though the study itself doesn't even mention learning.

&gt; If you want “proficient” answers, check the peer reviews.

If you had any meaningful experience in peer review, you would know that peer reviews are almost never made available to anyone but the authors and the editors.

&gt; The entire point of my argument is that there is ONE study supporting OPs perspective

If that's the point of your argument, then why did you not even mention it in the original comment? You didn't talk about the number of times similar results have been reported; you made baseless criticisms of the study.

This is a classic case of unskilled and unaware of it.

Don't get me wrong, what I experienced, I will take with me forever.
But I feel terrible for thinking that might be okay without being ready enough. I readied myself how I could, but my God nothing could have readied us for that.

I'm forever grateful to have such an amazing partner, and after that trip I'm fucked if I know how she still loves me. She says even though it was pretty bad, it made her love me more. She was just worried she was going to lose me.
She actually made a recording, and she showed me just last night. 
Just an audio recording, slowly leading up to the moments where I pissed myself and disappeared, wandering around, talking to my ex and getting aggravated (I was a part of a very abusive relationship and it's left me a bit damaged).
She made the call to kill the trip, and she did the right thing in hindsight.

That's understandable, I love the duration but like you said it's hard to fit that into the rest of the schedule, even more so with a family I'm sure. Shrooms fit that bill a bit easier.

I wouldn’t say im a communist lol, maybe a progressive I guess but I’m just a human who wants a fair solution for most people if not all assuming it’s possible. Doesn’t matter where you lean politically, both sides have their fair share of idiots, but the GOP is outright frightening and on a whole other level of stupidity.

Socialism is all over the US. Taxes in a way are a form of socialism yet the 1 percent doesn’t pay their fair share. Taxes pay for several public programs, and all public programs are socialist by nature. Medicare, social security, I mean it’s in the goddamn name, not to mention public schools, public hospitals, law enforcement, fire fighters. The whole idea of we the people … for the people by the people … that is what this country was founded on. Then capitalism said fuck that, for the money, by the rich.

"hfez4x2","Hello friends!

Number 7 here, The Lost Aether Compass. 

This book has definitely been inspired by stealth video games, particularly Dishonored, with a corrupt world run by a secret society and Void given powers. I want reading it to feel like a stealth game in parts, with random horror sequences, fast paced prose and lots of action. 

My characters are deeply flawed and unaware of their powers in the beginning and of how the world works. You won’t find any info dumping, but a gentle weave of information. There is a lot of a talk about alternate dimensions throughout the book because my main character gains the ability to walk between dimensions and travel anywhere in our world and others, using that to become the greatest thief/vigilante in the world, but only after she walks the labyrinth and gains the power (midpoint). So there is a huge emphasis on character growth, humor, ride or die friendships, with insane personal stakes, mystery and a bit of romance. 

You can definitely sense my fascination with archeology in here too. With huge sections spent exploring crypts, tunnels, with a labyrinth at the midpoint, and a race between several planes of dimensions at the end. A lot happens in this book.

It obviously could have been someone else - just a random guy on drugs or maybe someone playing a prank or someone trying to throw off authorities (for whatever reason). I don't doubt that the encounter happened though.

Reasons why it *could* be BL?

\-He might be out of it due to a mental health crisis, lack of sleep, lack of food/water, etc.

\-BL may not be aware of how large the search for him is, or that there is a huge manhunt out there at this point

\-BL has gone out of his way in the past after he committed the crime to reach out to people and create a storyline for himself. He did that while hitchhiking. He made sure to tell people about his fiance and how she was waiting for him in the van, making sure that he had an alibi and people believed that he thought she was alive when he left. 

This time, he *could* be trying to convince people that he never knew she died, and that she told him she was going to CA and he needs to meet her there. He could be desperate, and knowing that he will get caught soon is starting to tell people things to support some sort of storyline. Or he could be trying to portray an image of himself being mentally ill and unaware of what is going on.

I still think that it would be a dumb move on the part of BL because he was putting himself at risk of someone dialing 911 and him being caught pretty quickly.

"hf9mxsz","This caller is trying to make two very good points that I often get frustrated with MR and other lefties over. 
(1) Cultural trends are results of trends on philosophy trickling down into pop culture. This happens. There is a delayed effect, but philosophical movements and ideas trickle down into the language of pop culture, without the normies understanding where these ideas and concepts came from.
(2) Central concepts in libertarian and right wing culture are trickle downs from these philosophy movements. They have internalized some beliefs and concepts as ""fundamental"" or as their axioms. Libertarians value certain things for their own sake, as fundamental. You cannot directly argue them out of their political beliefs without dealing with these foundational beliefs they have. They first have to have the foundations broken for them to have any sort of paradigm shift. Reading Rand is the shortcut to figuring out what their foundations are.

Sam and Emma and others say they don't care that much and it doesn't matter. But it does. People are motivated not just by self interest but by moral beliefs. They don't know where their moral principles came from, but they absolutely did come from somewhere. To have any hope of real productive dialogue and argument with them we have to be able to attack these foundations.

Sam and other gen x lefties are the same way, just with different influences. He and others of his generation on the left often talk of moral language in a negative light and try to appeal to principles of self interest to convince people. This is 100% a trickle down from the logical positivists of the early-mid 20th century. To change sam's mind you would need to attack the moral foundations he's built his other views on, not argue all day about specific beliefs he has as a result of these foundations. He might not know about where these came from and might not be able to articulate them. But they're there. For all of us. 

And before anyone says it, yes, this matters for the average person. We all have foundational moral beliefs that motivate us and determine the shape of our overall worldview, goals, etc. If my foundations are different from yours, then no quibbling over specific policy decisions will change anything. You will be appealing to different principles than me. You have to first get on the same page to have any hope.

Tldr:
This caller is 100% correct, he's just not wording it well. And Sam and the rest are suspicious and unaware of how ""academics"" can influence the general population. Even though they are a product of these influences just as much as others. These sorts of enlightenment, humanistic ideals are learned, a result of cultural paradigm shifts, not just innate bits of knowledge. Gen x influenced by logical positivists, millennials by the humanitarian philosophers after them (Singer, Rawls, etc), post millennials by the post modern/deconstructionist movements. There is a delay in time it takes to trickle down. You have to understand cultural, including intellectual, context to understand people, and to argue with them well.

"hf0c9au","It's been a process and I think that ocd, while making me think nonstop, is keeping me from thinking about the important topics to heal. Because they are uncomfortable, and they make me ask questions about myself that I don't want to ask. Because my trauma was a big complicated mess and where some people might have an understanding that there is no reason to feel guilty for what happened in their childhood, I struggle to allow myself that same sense of not being responsible, even though I was a child. And maybe the cabin is there to remind me of that. To show me that I was in fact a child, full of innocence and wonder. I think I have painted a picture of myself in my subconscious (and part of this I did realize in therapy is from the things I was told about myself at the time) where somehow as a child I wasn't a child? Like I place all the responsibility and knowledge of right and wrong that I expect of my adult self on my childhood self. I hold it to standards that are impossible, because I was very much so, young and unaware of how things worked. Full of curiosity and the urge to play and explore. I do desperately want to go back, to not feel all this responsibility, and to not feel guilty. 

I did really start to notice some progress with my ocd when I started to allow myself to interpret my dreams, and I'm really greatful to have a therapist who was open to that and didn't shut it down as not important. 

I'm definitely in a loop with my compulsions, one I am trying to break, but (I just laughed a little thinking about this) life has a way of throwing more shit at me every time I start to make progress. And a lot of that shit has come from relationships, and it's probably necessary for me to deal with this shit because I needed to let go of unhealthy relationships, and maybe now I can finally focus on me healing.

What you said about interpreting other's dreams is probably a healthy coping skill. My therapist has told me that allowing ourselves to focus on other's problems and realize we aren't so alone in feeling lost can be helpful, but we have to remember to focus on our own junk. Which I can tell you are doing. And I can definitely say I appreciate you doing so, because sometimes we really just need to bounce these thoughts off someone else and hear how they read it.

Lol). I’m not entirely familiar with the essay you mentioned, but I’ll give it a read. I can’t discredit the idea that Higgins was perceivable as homosexual; but, if the notion that an author’s characters are projections of the id, then the argument could be made that this assumption was implicit in Shaw’s lifelong asexual history where he only married his wife at the age of 41 to discredit any claims of a scandalous nature when she moved in with him to care for him during a decline in health (after he had declined her suggestion of matrimony twice in the prior year). All-in-all, while publicly an advocate of socialism &amp; societal reform, he was overtly concerned by popular opinion in his life choices privately. It is widely believed that his marriage was never consummated and it never produced any children. His biographers agree that his closest relationships were formed with other men over the course of his lifetime; but, I would defer to the opinion of that this was due to his mother’s relationship with a man who he believed was his biological father due to his parents relationship being a marriage of convenience (not unlike his own). I think that this idea cemented in his mind a seed of distrust in the opposite sex, and that he only felt secure in the apparent honesty of his friendships with other men (who generally possessed a similar disposition about societal norms and valued intellectual pursuits over the romantic variety). This considered on top of the fact that his most well received works were satires of the suffragette movement; all of which could be interpreted as being both pro and/or critical of regarding the subject matter (which I was unaware of prior to reading the articles I have since because of your comment… so, sincerely, thank you); it’s no wonder that his name is the root of the descriptive adjective “Shav-ianistic” (which I find both less &amp; more insulting now as a reference to those who are sexist and unaware of their own beliefs as such at the same time, ha). Anyways, I actually just think that he was asexual, not a closeted homosexual; but, like I said before, if all authors’ characters are autobiographical then it’s a simple enough assumption to make… and he is regarded as one of the leading polemicist voices, where you argue a position by undercutting the foundational arguments of the opposition. However, when used in satire this can come across as critical of the presenter of the argument as much as they intend it to be sarcasm.

I don’t know, I just posted this because I was a grandchild of a man who loved Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein and all forms of contemporary musicals, so the name Brennan used for his shoeshine pulled up some dregs of *Poooor, Professor Higgins…* in the depths of my mindscape.

"hetq5cy","I'm so sorry that you are in a situation like this, OP. It is a tough case to crack and I will echo everyone else in the comments advocating calling in a specialist to help you figure it out.

Now, personally speaking, I know exactly how you feel. From what you describe, this was my first ever serious relationship, word for word. He was my first sexual partner ever, we didn't have the chance to get intimate several years down the line, I was inexperienced and unaware of what should be healthy norms for a fulfilling sex life between two loving partners, etc. 

A number of factors can contribute to your lack of desire. For me, it was a combination of things. First of all, I wasn't physically attracted to my ex. For a long while, I ignored that fact and kept my head down due to the almost idealistic belief that love should overcome anything. That I should be able to learn to want my partner. Which wasn't the case at all, and anyone with common sense would see that.

Secondly, my own lack of experience in the bedroom meant I was totally clueless as to what makes sex good. It didn't help that I was raised in a culture in which women are shamed for being sexually active before marriage. After a bit, I made time and effort to educate myself, and it has helped my following sexual endeavors with my next and current bf greatly. 

Third, I was subjected to trauma as a child and never sought help for it until I became an adult. The feeling of guilt, shame, pain, and everything else ruined it for me. Compounded with my upbringing, even the idea of sex repulsed me. Cue therapy and immense work later, I am at a better point in life where I can manage l, enjoy, and even seek out sex. Initiate and everything, woo.

Last but not least, communication. Holy fuck, communication. As mentioned above, after I had educated myself on the matter, I took a step forward to open up a direct and honest line of conversation towards my partner about how we could improve our sex life. He took it as a blow to his ego and shut down completely. Never made the effort to learn himself. Wasn't attentive to my needs. It got so bad that faking it and enduring things slowly presented itself as the more peacekeeping option, but that brought me zero happiness. So I left. We also weren't happy emotionally, so a lot of that seeped into our physical life as well. 

I don't know what your relationship is like, but as someone who was in your boat, these were the hard takeaways that came to me after a lot of reflection and recovery one bad relationship later. Obviously, I would still recruit professional help rather than taking a reddit stranger's advice as the gospel truth, but yeah. 

Just know that you are very brave for making the effort to tackle this, even if it is as small as posting about it to a bunch of online people.

"hete1d2","So the very first time I came across Nosleep was during a very boring internship where I had very little work to do and unrestricted internet access, circa 2010. It started by just googling dark history to learn about, and fictional stories that went along with it, but I somehow came across a link to Reddit (which I didn't know existed at the time, first time having personal computer access was in college and smart phones didn't exist yet) and stories on NoSleep - which I immediately began binge reading. Having very little understanding of Reddit in general and unaware of the RP rules in the comments - I actually thought the stories were real!! I truly thought people were sharing scary, supernatural things that happened to them and looking for advice. And back then alot of authors would include links to pictures to go along with the stories, making it feel even more real. I even remember telling my friends all about it, because growing up in the rural Midwest we used to go ""ghost hunting"" all the time. Meaning we would drive to places that were supposedly haunted/ had old legends in the middle of the night and basically trespass until someone was scared enough to leave - think abandoned schools, cemeteries, etc. So it was all very exciting at the time. Clearly I caught on to the fact that it is a platform for fictional writing and turned from a long time lurker to someone with an actual account for posting, and while I still very much enjoy NoSleep as a whole I find myself much less interested in the comments now. The RP does feel a bit tired in 2021 where the mystic is gone and we all know it's not real. Whereas I do read the comments on shortscarystories to hear more from the author, especially when they talk about their inspirations which I find very interesting. So after a long rant, I agree with your proposal for a trial run to change the RP rule and see how it plays out.",1632978100,"having very little understanding of reddit in general and unaware of the rp rules in the comments - i actually thought the stories were real!!","general and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"general and unaware","general",NA,NA,0

Interestingly, my favorite expression of the growth journey is actually found in the suite of cups in the tarot.  The five of cups is the card of loss and grief, and is usually depicted as a person who has lost three of their five cups and they are grief-stricken and heartbroken.  The six of cups typically represents nostalgia and looking back, thinking about happier times especially when we were innocent and unaware of pain.  The seven of cups is being presented with so many cups that you can't choose them all, dreaming of what could be.  The eight of cups sees a person walking away - *walking away* - from ALL of the cups in search of the truth.  They've let go of trying to hold on, and say ""fuck it"".  And then we come to the nine of cups, which is typically emotional fulfillment.  By walking away, by letting go, by searching for the truth, by being grounded in ourselves and turning inward to fulfill ourselves and fill our own cup, we find what we were looking for all along.

It's the four and five of cups I find particularly interesting.  The four of cups is depicted as a person who who is dissatisfied and unhappy, they are looking at their three cups and so disappointed that they can't even see the fourth cup they are being offered.  The five of cups always shows two upright cups that the person doesn't see because they are so focused on the cups they have lost.

Now if you are coming from a law of attraction paradigm, you might say that you could 'manifest' what you want by 'raising your vibration' and focusing on the two cups you still have in the five of cups, or the one cup you are being offered in the four of cups.  But really, the journey *isn't* about holding on to the cups at all.  While recognizing and paying attention to what you have is a positive thing, it isn't a silver bullet.  The cups show *a journey* to a place where it doesn't matter about what cups we are offered and have because we have learned to fill our own cup.

So instead of looking to others for emotional fulfillment, we come to a place where we are our *own* emotional fulfillment.  But it's a journey, it isn't something we are compelled to do the instant we feel loss and pain or anger.  We can know the direction and respect the process it takes to get there, and then when we look back on the journey, we have so much that can't be taken from us by anyone.

No one else can take what we have learned from us, can take our experience and history, our pride in overcoming obstacles and of triumphing in horrible circumstances.  We weren't victims of a holocaust, but childhood victims of abuse experienced years of torture (intended or not) at the hands of the very people who were supposed to love us.  The very people we loved so hopefully and desperately.  

We survived, we endured, and no one can take the truth of our experience away from us; no one can take our strength or our heartbreak; no one can live our life or experience our journey.  It is ours, and we get to learn and make mistakes and feel our feelings and try different things and do our best and do our worst.

Re-read my explanation of what a phobia is. Sloowwwlllyy this time. Maybe it will get through your thick skull in twenty or so tries.

&gt;Do you honestly think that there are homophobes out there that are legitimately afraid of gay people or are you just this dense?

Again, read what I said about what a phobia is.

&gt;I was going to argue your other points but then you quoted Churchill and I died laughing at the irony

It's not unheard of to draw inspiration from your oppressors. If you can learn something, it doesn't matter where it comes from, but I can understand your closed mind not being able to comprehend this. (Ever read *Invictus* or at least watched the movie?) Besides the original quote belonged to an Italian thinker, Churchill just said it in a context. I wouldn't expect you to do any more than just laugh it off cause let's face it, who puts in so much effort for defending an *assumption* which is what your entire argument is based on?

&gt;Also, sidenote, hatred is envy. Not jealousy. Not fear. There's some awesome literature I could refer you to if only you were literate. (better insult?)

Do I need to school you on language as well? Envy and Jealousy are literally synonyms and mean the same thing. Words don't change their meaning just because you choose to use them in an incorrect context and incorrectly. That's just plain dumb.  
Also, Hatred = Envy? Since when? I said jealousy/envy/fear leads to hatred but they are very distinct emotions, quite different from one another. This isn't even about semantics anymore, you're just plain dumb and unaware of how to use words in the right context or even frame a proper rhetoric.  
I sincerely doubt a kid who doesn't even know what a phobia is and that envy and jealousy are the same thing, could direct me to any kind of sensible literature.

All you've made are dense senseless attempts at taking a jibe at me and my points with your ""*assumptions.*"" This is exactly why I said, educate yourself first and then form an opinion. I can't even take this statement of yours as an insult. It's like a 5th grader challenging me to a debate on current affairs and history, of which he has barely any knowledge and then calling me a ""*bully*"" cause he can't find anything better to say.

"hejli84","When Fjord sacrificed his powers, it was after 60+ episodes of gradually realizing his patron was evil. Travis as a player had a good idea of what he was getting into, and Matt had essentially forced him to either push in an evil direction or make a hard choice. Meanwhile, other characters like Caduceus and Jester were making overtures to Fjord of helping him get power from somewhere else. Travis knew that on the other side of this choice was an opportunity to reinvent Fjord.

Two or three (I don't remember when this started) episodes into EXU, an 8-episode miniseries, we still have basically no idea of what Opal and Ted's relationship is. Now they're arguing about something that we have minimal context for, and that argument now means Opal has no powers. Rather than diving further into the backstory, the RP just consists of Opal and Ted arguing. Opal is so nerfed by this choice that she nearly dies in a fight where her only option seems consistently to be throwing daggers at people. At the end of all this RP...She still won't admit that she needs Ted, but she gets her powers back. Opal has learned or gained nothing, and I as a viewer got nothing out of it.

They actually don't. They only have a vax rate of 62% of the population. Nowhere near the threshold for herd immunity. 

To put that into perspective, Canada is at 71% fully vaccinated.

"he8on4z","&gt;Yet you seem unable to explain why it is not a contradiction

I didn't know i need to explain obvious things. Which doesn't change the fact that Su saying that Kuvira is like a daughter to her in a conversation with someone who may not be aware of that, and Su calling Kuvira her daughter (pretty much) in a conversation with someone who is aware of that is not mutually exclusive. Kuvira doesn't have to be a ""legitimized"" Beifong for Su to refer to her as her daughter. It's like very close and best friends may call each other brothers (and i don't mean ""bro"" despite not being blood relatives).

&gt;Su had numerous occasions to introduce Kuvira as her child like after the dance recital or right after Opal left

The show itself didn't give Kuvira a proper introduction until the season finale, despite the fact that you can see and hear her like a dozen times in previous episodes. For whatever reason the writers wanted to do it later, after she saves Tonraq. That doesn't prove in any way that Kuvira wasn't considered a part of the family. Kuvira definitely got introduced to Kuvira off screen, since Korra knows who she is and that she saved her father despite not being there at the moment, and was convinced that they can talk it out as if they know each other personally to some degree.

&gt;Lin even comments it must be a nightmare to have 5 kids when she technically had 6 if you count Kuvira. Suyin doesn't bother to correct Lin about the number of kids she had

They had communication problems just in general, and since Lin is an actual Beifong, Su calling Kuvira her sixth child would confuse Lin and other people.

&gt;Toph doesn't live in Zaofu

That doesn't forbid Su from having her mother's photo.

&gt;Kuvira lived in Su's mansion since she was 8 yet not a single photo with her with the family

We only see one photo of the family, don't make it seem as if there were many and that it's demonstrative.

&gt;Su let Lin bark orders at her

Lin barks orders at everyone, including Su. And Su didn't even confront her when Lin lashed out at Opal, which was very out of place. Here it's justified, since everyone is stressed out, the orders are necessary, reasonable and urgent, not to mention it had nothing to do with raising her voice at Kuvira specifically (like with Opal) but yelling just in general, and Zaofu guards with Kuvira in charge majorly fucked up by letting the Red Lotus in and out of the city.

&gt;in addition to barking a few herself

I don't remember her ""barking"", but even if it happened once at some point, see above.

&gt;Except the entirety of Book 3 and Book 4

Not really. We didn't see their relationship, we barely see Kuvira and Su talk, but nothing we do see contradicts it.

&gt;How doesn't it? Elaborate

Here we go, explaining obvious things again. Baatar Jr. saying that Su considers herself enlightened, doesn't prove your and other Su haters' claim that she is ""not as enlightened as she thinks or claims to be"".

&gt;It is a baseless accusation to assume Kuvira convinced him of this

Well since both are baseless assumptions, don't try using one of them to support your claim. Because i can use the opposite one the same way.

&gt;There is is ample evidence that he is in his father's shadow. They have the same name, hobbies, and Jr worked as his father's lackey before running off with Kuvira

That doesn't prove that he had a problem with that until Kuvira's plot. He didn't seem to during the one fucking scene with zero lines that lasted a few seconds, that he had in the previous season. Not to mention that he engeneered all of his father's projects, so he wasn't in the back seat during their brain storms and developing technologies.

&gt;Baatar Jr. believed in the ideals as of the Earth Empire as much as Kuvira. He simply loved Kuvira far more than he loved their country while Kuvira placed her duties as leader above her personal life

So this is why as soon as Kuvira betrayed him, he stopped giving a single fuck about their country, empire and all the work they did, and immediately apologized to his mother, admitted that he betrayed the family and started helping the avatar oppose Kuvira. If he at least to some degree believed in the Earth Empire's ideals, not to mention as much as Kuvira does, that doesn't even remotely make any sense.

&gt;Kuvira placed her duties as leader above her personal life

Alot of people place their career above their personal life. But this is a very interesting way of avoiding saying that she tried to murder her fiance.

&gt;We see Suyin in a flashback banish only Kuvira

We only see Su talking to Kuvira. Because with the exception of her son there are no actual characters in the scene. And he left the scene before Su approached Kuvira. And after the conversation they left. And Su says ""If you live now, you'll not be welcomed back"", not specifying that she only talks about Kuvira or all of them.

&gt;They all left with Kuvira because they believed Zaofu should get involve and help the EK recover

Another baseless assumption. Even trying to conclude their opinion on the topic based on what Kuvira says to Su, which, as i said, is not reliable source of information, will not lead you to this assumption. You don't know what was going through Su's son's head, or any other person's head among those who left with Kuvira, they don't voice their opinions, there's nothing that would even imply anything about their motivation. They just follow Kuvira for a reason that was left unspecified and unconfirmed. So PLEASE stop making stuff up, it got old a few comments ago.

&gt;We'll we dont see her campaign so we dont how she slept

As much effort i put into arguing with people who call her a Hitler, even i'm not such an apologist to actually and seriously try to argue and convince someone that she's not that had of a person and that her actions bothered her.

&gt;Kuvira was not found guilty of slavery in court

Good for her. It still was a thing allowed and practiced in HER empire, and i find it hard to believe she didn't know anything about it. It's not exactly secret brainwashing experiments, it's impossible to hide, especially from the one in charge of everything. She's not the AtlA Earth King level dumb and unaware of what's going on.

&gt;Yes plague it's not like there wasnt a national healthcare system as there was no central government

"he5n8rd","Everybody knows that we're human beings. From a Christian's perspective we could call ourselves human spiritual beings.

The human part, is your physical body. Including your mind. Your body could be described as your Earth suit.

Your spirit, is the other part of yourself that's not physical, but it's everything else they can actually live forever. How you get to recognize your spirit, is that it is that part of your mind that isn't just your brain.

So I just drew a distinction between mind and brain. Kind of funny huh.

Let me try to describe it a little different.

You know that desire that you have in you to experience the freedom in this life to cause and create something wonderful for other people and yourself? That desire comes from the Holy Spirit. That is your spirits natural desire. When scripture talks about God's will for your life, this is what God's will is for your life. God wants you to experience the freedom in this life to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for other people and yourself. You know, the wonderful stuff.

But your body comes with a desire all of his own. And it's completely different than the desire that the Holy Spirit and your spirit has.

Your body simply desires to not die. Your body does everything it possibly can, and it's number one job is to make sure it does not die.

The way he does this is by making sure that the body is feeling good, looking good and being wise and aware. Because your body knows that the more you feel bad, look bad and are being unwise and unaware, the closer you're getting to dying. Which is what your body does not want.

So the question is how can you tell the difference between the two?

We've already recognized that your body uses its brain. And in this particular case there's actually a part of your brain called the amygdala. It is your amygdala's job to make sure your body does not die. It's kind of a cool little Walnut shaved a little tiny reptilian part of your brain.

So your body's going to use part of your brain to make sure it does not die. But then you get the rest of your mind to be able to work on the things that really matter in life. What really matters in life is not what we can sense with our five senses, it's what we can experience and what we can cause and create for those around us.

The easy way to tell the difference between the two. Is that if you're feeling bad, looking bad or being obviously unwise and not aware, the thoughts that are going through your head are your bodies thoughts. Directly. Your body is going to start trying to figure out how can get back to feeling good looking good and being good. Otherwise it's going to fear death. Or all the unpleasantnesses that go before you die.

My spirit can either be alive. Or it could be dead. Or it can be somewhere in between. Scripture says that when sin is fully complete... Blah blah blah. Which is just an indicator that there's a process going on.

So if you have a desire within you to cause and create something wonderful for somebody. That's your spirit's desire to cause and create something wonderful for somebody. And that's in line with what God would want you to do. That's what scriptures are talking about doing good works. Producing good fruit. Overcoming strongholds. Becoming sanctified. Following the instructions that teach you how to become more righteous. All of that... Are things that your spirit wants to do. Because it wants to maintain its ability to experience the freedom to cause and create wonderful things for other people and yourself.

And you're already aware there's that there are certain ways that you can think, and there are certain things that you can do, that can interfere with, and limit or eliminate your ability to experience the type of freedom I'm talking about.

Here's a fun thing just a note.

If you are walking in the freedom like I'm talking about, and you're causing and creating wonderful things for people, you're going to have the experience of feeling good, looking good and being considered wise and aware. It's a double whammy. Your spirit's happy and your body's happy. No issues.

But if your body starts to feel bad look bad and be considered unwise and unaware, the first thing it's going to think about doing, is fixing the problem. And it will do anything it needs to do in order to get back to feeling good looking good and being good. This is where temptation exists.

So let's say that somebody comes up to you smacks you across the face and says that you're a stupid idiot. Well that feels bad. He did it in front of people now you look bad. And if you don't handle this situation then you really are going to be a stupid idiot and you're going to be completely unwise and unaware of how to handle situations like this. So you better do something mister!!!!

If you retaliate, it is your body making a decision for you.

If you choose instead, to turn the other cheek... You're just exercised self-control and allowed your spirit to make a decision. Instead of letting your body make a decision.

One of the easy ways to tell what is your body versus what is the Holy Spirit, is that your spirit always agrees with the Holy Spirit. One of the reasons why we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us and give us instructions in righteousness, and teach us about what's written in scripture. Specifically talking about the teachings of Christ. So that our spirit can become alive in Christ. Because remember I said earlier that your spirit could also be dead. Or kind of sickly. 

So the way you can tell the two apart, who's doing the deciding? Especially when your body starts to feel bad... Who's doing the deciding?

It's okay to feel like you want to smack somebody back. That's just being tempted. But it's so much better for you if you turn your cheek because your spirit. That part in you that wants to cause and create something wonderful, chose not to harm the other person. So what you're doing instead is causing something potentially wonderful. At the least you're keeping yourself out of a situation where you could be doing yourself more harm than good. So maybe you're doing yourself a favor. Which is part of the Holy Spirit's desire for you you're allowed to do things wonderful for yourself. God loves that stuff.

A lot of people want to make the flesh the bad guy. The thing is though, is that the flesh is our Earth suit. You have to take care of your Earth suit. Otherwise you're going to start having a bad time here on this planet. If you don't take care of your suit, you might not get to stay here very long. If you don't take care of your Earth suit, you might lose a lot of your physical freedoms. And if you start to lose your physical freedoms it impedes a little bit on your spiritual freedoms.

Think of it this way, you see somebody up on the hillside dangling, and you happen to be driving when you saw them hanging by their fingertips. And you want to go help them. Do you want to do something wonderful for them. But your crippled from diabetes and he can't walk very much in your heart disease keeps you from being able to take more than 10 steps. There's no way you're going to be able to get up on that cliff and save them. And your cell phone is not working and there's nobody else around. because he didn't take care of your physical body. You just limited what your spiritual man can accomplish.

Remember the early rule I said is that you're ways of thinking and the things that you do can limit or eliminate the freedom you want to experience in life the most. Which is causing and creating wonderful things for other people and yourself.

"he4u814","Sorry for the late answer. I went to bed and went straight to work after, but here I am. I hope this makes sense and I used correct wording. Im about to go to bed again and pretty tired + I just kept rambling about the ""submission weakness"" part

&gt; Yes, I do find submission a form of weakness to a degree. 

This is my personal opinion on submission here. (Not just the ""usual submission"" in ""normal"" relationships but also focusing on the dom/sub dynamic often found in BDSM relationships) 

_[skip if not interested, it's also very long]_

I view it as strengh under control. Submission is a choice. You're free to do whatever you desire, whenever you choose to, but yet with all your freedom you choose to give yourself to another person

Putting your body in the hands of someone else takes balls, strengh, self-preservation. Submitting to someone means you have absolute trust in the other person and are okay with being vurnerable.
As a person that is dominant you have to earn submission, because you have to earn their trust 

Ex: If you were driving with a person you barely know and you get tired. Not too bad, but it would propably be good to have someone else driving. Would you let the person you barely know drive the car while you're asleep and unaware of your surroundings? Most people won't. But now imagine you're in a car with someone you know and cherish. You get tired. The person next to you is a great driver and has earned your trust. The chances that you will let the person drive while you sleep next to them is higher. You're willing to take the risk. The risk that something could happen, accidentally, or the family member/friend you trust and love might decide to betray and harm you somehow 

Submission is power, a power that doesn't come without risk. You could get hurt, betrayed or abused in certain situations. If we go to an extreme and say you are fully tied up, not able to defend yourself in any way if the other person chose to use their power over you to harm you - You're defenceless. Yet you still take the risk because you have the ability to fully trust the person you're with. Trusting someone and being vurnerable to that degree isn't an easy task for many. (it took me 3 years before I was able to even cry I front of my wife without feeling shame or embarrassment) 

Besides that, there are many cases where people that submit to someone sexually are people in powerful positions. Giving away control and letting themselves be fully vurnerable is liberating to them. A contrast to their usual daily life, therapeutic or healing even. They are far from being weak. (Though I get that seeing submission as weakness doesn't mean you see the whole person as weak) 

As men especially, giving yourself to someone by submitting is something we're being looked down upon. There is an internal conflict many men have to fight, figure out and accept before being able to submit - which takes courage to do

❕ Another approach would be: Weakness is a condition of lacking strength. It's a state of being, not a decision. On the other hand, if I'm engaging with a superior force (police, a boss etc) I might choose to submit. 
When you look at submission as a conscious choice and weakness as a condition, it is easier to see them for the separate entities they are. Healthy submission resulting from conscious decisions can open pathways to fully enriched experiences 

If you do accidentally submit to the wrong person or if you submit because you feel the need to be under someone else's control, that's when abuse is most likely to happen though 

[submission =/= obedience ](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-submission-and-vs-obedience/ )

When the dynamic of my wife and I's relationship was a bit different I viewed her submission as a gift. I gave her tasks, punishments and rewards, but I wouldn't have had that power without her submission*. I had power because she allowed me to have it. She belonged to me not simply because I said so, but because she had the will and strengh to let me experience her a way nobody else ever would. The strong woman that would order everyone around at work and not let anyone push her around

""Submission doesn't mean weakness; it means exploring your wants and desires and being strong enough to give control of yourself to someone else.""
― Melinda Barron 

(*I'm aware that for someone to submit there has to be someone to be dominant. I'm just so flashed(?) by the act of submission, possibly because I would never bring up the courage to completely submit the way my wife and other prior partners did to me)

&gt; I’ve just seen too much. Coworkers crying on my shirt because she regrets all the things she did for a man who ghosted her after some fun. 

I get what you mean but she could've also been fucked over by a man she had sex with without being the submissive part. And being ghosted by a him puts the dude in the position of an asshole or someone who can't deal with confrontation, not her as weak by submitting to him (imo). The responsibility lays on the man that did wrong, not the woman that's the victim. He made the decision to use her trust to be an ass and hurt her 

&gt; What was supposed to be FWB (friend with benefits) went south. She loved him. He only liked her. Turned out he liked a lot of ladies there and them to him. She detailed all the things she regretted as I stood there silently. 

But what does this has to do with her submitting to him? Imagine a man and a woman having FWB, the guy being the more dominant part and the woman being submissive. He catches feelings but she doesn't feel the same. He finds out she sleeps with multiple men and he feels crushed 

&gt; Multiply that by seven sisters. It’s such a weird mental double standard, because the women my age I see our sex as wonderful. All the explicit things that entails. When they prefer rough I find that strong. When they can dish it out just as well as they can take it aggression wise my respect goes way up. I don’t know. 

I'm still wondering what your exact issue is with your daughter having that type of sex when you seem to have a healthy view about it. Is it the fear of how other men will view her? The situations she might get in? More generally, an awkward realisation that your daughter looks similar to the girls you used to be attracted to when you were younger? Having your babygirl grow to become a woman? You just wanting to protect her from possible harm? 

&gt; YES!!! Very, very similar to the thought of ones parents going at it. Repulsed, as I am. Quite normal there, which is why I don’t understand the abnormality attached to be repulsed by the thought of my daughter doing it. 

Isn't this a topic you can talk with some of your 7 sisters about? Seems like female imput could be helpful, especially since they might've encountered e.g. male partners that had issues with the idea of their possible future daughter having sex 

&gt; While I will be there for her in many ways, conversations surrounding sexual situations with any boyfriend can be NOPED straight to her mom 

A ""no, talk to your mother about that!"" can create shame and stigma around the topic and make it seem like something she can't trust you with or she might feel like this is a topic she shouldn't talk about with a man an is for ""girls/women only"" when it's something that she should be able to talk about no matter the other person's gender 

&gt; Just as I’d imagine my wife wouldn’t want to hear about the exploits of her son, 

There are multiple studies about parents educating their children about sex. One of them was the one by [University hospitals of Lausanne and Zurich](https://www.tagblatt.ch/leben/die-verlegenheit-der-vater-ld.1098813) in 2018, attended by 7142 young people between the ages of 24-26. A majority of them stated that they talked about their sexuality mainly with friends (37%) in their childhood and adolescence. In second place came the mothers (22.4%). The fathers (3.7%) ended up behind on one of the lowest ranks 

If the job is being done and the child is getting educated, no matter if son or daughter, it's usually the mother having these conversations. Your wife might be less inhibited to teach your son about sex than you think 

&gt; but I’d be able to speak to him from the perspective of our gender, just as she could to the daughter. 

Yes and that's important. What is also important though, is that they can have a perspective from the other sex 

Especially when your child is 13+ it's not enough to explain the biological processes and prevent unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases. It's about more: about sexting/flirting, intimacy, consent, sexual and gender identity, boundaries, equality between men and women in bed, masturbation, sexual arrousal, attraction, romance/love/relationships etc etc 

You as a man have different viewpoints on these topics than her mother does. You don't experience intimacy or arousal the same way a female does.
There is input you can give her that her mother won't be able to give but will be important if she chooses to date or sleep with men.
Her mother's perspective will be similar to the one her mother has, you can give the perspective closer to her male partners, which leads to her having more understanding about certain things

&gt; Only cross pollination would occur if any man didn’t have her consent. At that point, yes someone’s head is literally getting slapped off. 

understandable and not disagreeing 

&gt; Beyond that, I’d not deliberately behave in ways that would negatively influence people my daughter pursued. What I would do, is ensure her boyfriend knew he’s to respect her, treat her right and definitely take his shoes off when in her daddy’s house. Just as I’d pop the back of my sons head if I found out he’s a player who doesn’t treat women correctly, and wouldn’t tolerate disrespectful behavior from any woman he brought to my home.

"he22ast","To answer the question addressed first I would say that the Jesus in Gnosticism and Orthodoxy are painted differently. Most the Gnostics schools would have been inspired by the teachings of Jesus and analyzed them through different interpretations. The early Church fathers would have been very much Messianic Jews and would have adhered to the Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim and Megillah. However early Gnostics would gave been Greco-Egyptian with some Jews ethically assimilated into society. 

Logion 27 of Thomas traditional reads: 

""If you do not make the sabbath ""sabbath"", you will not see the father"". 

This can be understood that if one doesn't keep the sabbath they will not be admitted to experiencing the presence of the father. 

I read a commentary on the Gospel of Thomas that had this paraphrased translation below: 

""If you pass from sabbath to sabbath all of you will not perceive the heart of The Father.""

Here Logion 27 is referring to ""time"", from week to week in that one observes the ritual of the sabbath although doesn't put it into daily practice therefore cannot perceive the heart of the Father. 

It can be interpreted many ways with the heart being everything from judgement to compassion to the Pleroma; whatever one perceives the ""heart of the Father"" to be. The perception of time here could be moment to moment; it is open ended how one wants to understand it for themselves. 

Some have an extreme take that the sabbath shouldn't be observed in a traditional sense with lamb of god, animal sacrifices, found in the ancient customs of the Abrahamic religions; not adhering to the customs of the Old Testament. 

Translation 3: 

""If you bear the fruits sabbath to sabbath you will not see the Judgment (heart) of the Father.""

In this case ""the fruits"" or eipe in coptic can also be translated as ""to befall"". Here the fruits are a metaphor to a sinful befall. In other words sinful actions that continue from week to week will prevent ones ultimate salvation and condemn them to the infernal realms or the cycle of reincarnation depending on your belief. Heart of the father can be viewed in other ways as it saying that sin itself deters one from understanding and perceiving the divine. 

""But you have to become like the Jews...""

This statement in another translation is written as, 
""You do not realize who I am from what I say to you. Rather you have become like the Judeans, for they love the tree but hate his fruit, or they love the fruit but hate the tree.""

This statement has some antisemitic connotations to it, not gonna lie, but it is Christian based. Not saying all Jews are this way. It says something along the lines of one becomes ""like"" the Jews rather than one has to become a Jew. 

There is more to the passage than what I previously mentioned although it more or less is a messianic passage suggesting that there are those that pass by without realizing or acknowledging that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. As for the fruit part here some view it from a Naasene or Ophite lense that the knowledge of the fruit through the serpent was a blessing in disguise rather than it being entirely a mistake.

&gt;[Letter 36](http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_bahai_administration#letter36)

&gt;To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís

&gt;of the United States and Canada. Dearly-beloved fellow-workers:

&gt;I have on two recent occasions given expression to the profound sense of inspiring confidence and joyous gratitude which recent happenings in the Cause--evident manifestations of the steady evolution of a living Faith--must needs evoke in the heart of every thoughtful and observing believer. And as I contemplate the far-reaching possibilities involved in a careful handling of those forces which Bahá'u'lláh's almighty arm has now released, I cannot help reflecting upon the dominant share which the American friends, at home as well as in distant lands, have contributed to this rejuvenation of the Cause of God, and the decisive part it is theirs to play in its eventual victory.

&gt;Your letters, dated June 17, July 11, July 20, August 3 and 16, and October 2, 1926, all of which have been forwarded during my days of retirement and rest, have proved an added source of thankfulness, of joy and strength to me. They have clearly revealed by their spirit, as well as by the nature and variety of their contents, the sustained devotion, the unabated confidence, and the increasing vigor and efficiency with which you are initiating, coordinating, and consolidating the manifold activities of the Cause in North America.

 &gt;**International Secretariat**

&gt;The range and character of the problems confronting you, as revealed by the careful perusal of the minutes of your meetings, the steady increase in the number and effectiveness of vigorously functioning Centers in Central and Northern Europe, and the growing significance and complexity of the work that has to be necessarily conducted from the Holy Land, have all served to strengthen the feeling of absolute necessity for the formation in Haifa of some sort of an International Bahá'í Secretariat, which both in an advisory and executive capacity will have to aid and assist me in my vast and exacting labors. I have anxiously considered this important matter in all its bearings during the past few months, and have accordingly requested three well-informed, capable representatives from America, Europe and the East to visit the Holy Land this fall, that we may lay down the foundation of this vitally needed institution. We shall take counsel together and decide, not only upon the measures that have to be promptly undertaken to meet the pressing demands of the present hour, but upon the wider issues that on one hand will strengthen the ties that should bind the International Center of the Cause with the world at large, and on the other provide for the preliminary steps that will eventually lead to the proper establishment of the First International House of Justice.

&gt;It is my earnest hope and prayer that this exchange of thought and close cooperation in the work that has henceforth to be internationally and vigorously conducted, will enable me to participate more minutely and effectively in the labors of the various administrative departments of your Assembly, and thus reinforce the splendid efforts you are exerting for the extension of its influence and the widening of its scope.

&gt;**Plan of Unified Action**

&gt;From the report of the National Treasurer, setting forth the account of the progress of the contributions of the American believers for the support of the Plan of Unified Action, up to June 30, 1926, I gather that the result has by no means exceeded our expectations, nay has considerably fallen below what I confidently expected it to achieve. I earnestly renew my plea and appeal to you, and through you to every true and faithful lover of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, to realize, while there is yet time, the far-reaching possibilities with which the present situation is fraught. I am firmly convinced that this Plan combines, embodies, and serves the twofold purpose of the present-day Bahá'í administration in the United States and Canada, namely the promotion of the vitally needed teaching work, and the provision for the gradual completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, both wishes so near and dear to our beloved Master's heart. It is the only effective, feasible, and practical instrument placed in our hands for the speedy accomplishment of our ends. So much that is vital to the future welfare, the effectiveness, and the fair name of our beloved Cause depends, I assure you, upon the success or failure of this nobly-conceived, this sound and befitting enterprise. The eyes of all Bahá'ís and of many sympathizers throughout the world are turned towards you, eager to reinforce your accomplishments in this field, expectant to witness what measure of success you are capable of achieving.

&gt;**World Unity Conferences**

&gt;In connection with the series of World Unity Conferences which you have initiated and so laboriously organized, I feel that in order to reap the fullest advantage and benefit from this laudable effort, it is absolutely essential to follow up with the aid of enlightened, experienced and capable teachers the interest which has been aroused. Such a group of teachers should judiciously select those few among the many interested, and endeavor with patience and sympathy and by constant intimate personal intercourse, to prepare them gradually for the entire and unreserved acceptance of the fundamentals of the Bahá'í Revelation. If the results be meagre, if the attendance be small, let us not despair, nor relax in our efforts. Let us remember that this sound method will eventually triumph, if we only consistently support it, and persevere in undertaking those subsequent steps that can alone produce full and permanent benefit.

&gt;**Appeal to the Sháh of Persia**

&gt;I have already expressed my grateful appreciation of the prompt and wise measures you have taken in behalf of our oppressed and down-trodden brethren in Persia. The noble appeal which you were moved to address to His Majesty the Sháh, so illuminating, so courteous, so powerful, and the wide range of publicity you have undertaken, were truly providential in character, and will undoubtedly prove an inspiration and solace to those who still continue to be trampled under the heel of an odious and inveterate enemy. I have had your appeal translated into Persian and sent to all Centers throughout the Orient that the suffering in Persia may learn of your bold and courageous intervention, and witness the signs of their promised redemption which, as foretold by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, must first be made manifest through the efforts of their brethren in that great freedom-loving Republic of the West.

&gt;It is sad and distressing to reflect that, notwithstanding the repeated appeals addressed to the authorities concerned, and so powerfully reinforced by the spontaneous action of some of the leading Governments of the West, Persia, still heedless and unaware of the spiritual forces that are at work, continues to treat with indifference and contempt the most loyal, innocent and law-abiding subjects of its realm. The chronic instability of its affairs, the changing fortunes of factions and shadowy personalities that sap its vitality and tarnish its name, the acute and widespread economic depression that is now prevailing, and the grave discontent of the masses of the people, all tend to aggravate a situation already highly threatening to the security of its sorely tried children. What else can we do but pray most fervently that the almighty power of Bahá'u'lláh may soon triumph over this petty strife, this age-long tyranny, and make, as He prophesied, of the land of His birth, ""the most honored of all governments, the pride, the admiration and the envy of the peoples of the world.""

"hdtztm2","It seems that at one point you did like the guy, right? There are some things you like, and then you have found some things you didn't like. Isn't that what most relationships are, mix of things we like about someone and things we learn to deal with, accept or solve them in some way? I don't think you should feel obliged to be friends because of his mental state, friendship should be reasonably enjoyable for both of you. But, what if something in you is triggered and it made you lost the ability to see him in the same way as it was in the beginning?

  
Things you have mentioned as annoying, and please, don't get me wrong, but they sound quite superficial to me. Some of them appear like something that you should communicate to him. Maybe he will have no problem to adapt. Did you tell him that standing close bothers you at all? Is him having no backbone as in sushi situation is not a significant moral flow, something that can hurt you? Does it makes him a bad person? I would understand if you have noticed that he lies intentionally to get some kind of advantage, if he is a manipulative person, if he is hurting other people, but you have described pretty harmless person that has problems but still tries to be nice to people around him, to the best of his abilities. One of the things you have mentioned as paranoid is not even really irrational completely - a lot of people who are vaccinated have still got covid, including Dr K, right? Everything is subjective and I do understand that those things are bothering you, but are they really so offensive and hard on you? What if something else is in play?

You should not feel obliged and forced to be friends with him, and you are not his parent or therapist. Sometimes it is hard to define the boundaries of friendship. But this situation can possibly be much more important for you than you think. My own experience is that when we have strong reactions and dislikes to people who we have met and previously liked, that is often because we share personality traits with them, traits we dislike in ourselves. Those kind of people have conflicts, weaknesses and problems we have too, but much more exaggerated, more visible. In those kind of situations in the past I have felt anger, disdain, I was repulsed because those were things I hated about myself or felt these problems are kind of under control in my case but other person can't do that. I was judgmental and irritated. In those cases that person was a mirror to myself, really unlikable mirror because I was trying to run away from ""weak"", ""unlovable"" ""socially awkward"" myself. I was trying to be a cool dude, to hang out with people who will raise my image and social standing, who will make me feel better about myself, and there was this guy, like some kind of repulsive caricature of myself that makes me nervous, that can't control his impulses the way I am managing, that shows all the weakness I have spent years learning how to hide.

  
In my case I ghosted and run. I thought it was better for me, that it was justified because this other person doesn't want to change and is beyond help. 

Today I see I could have just communicated how I feel, keep healthy distance and enjoy the part of that person that I have liked when I met him. Instead I went through the phase of acting like his psychiatrist, becoming focused only on bad things, getting frustrated and then finally run from him. My fear of ending like him in life, to be perceived by other people like he was perceived by me, to be judged by being other people based on being in his company made me totally blind and unaware of my projections. It took years until it dawned on me that it was all about me, not about him.

If what I have said is applicable to you, it still doesn't mean you are not a decent person or that you should force yourself to be his friend. I think most of the people have this kind of impulses. But I do think you can actually learn a lot about yourself by spending some time with him and be aware what is happening inside of you. Communicate clearly but respectfully what is bothering you, be open, and put some boundaries if you need it. Be reasonably helpful but do not take responsibility for his life. Think about what is good about this relationship and what you can give and what you can learn. Not all relationships are there to be enjoyable all of the time. Some things can make us feel uncomfortable, but if the other guy is not inherently bad person, maybe it's us an not them, and we can use the situation to learn something new and free ourselves. Make sure you are not trying to run from what you see in the mirror!",1632310995,"my fear of ending like him in life, to be perceived by other people like he was perceived by me, to be judged by being other people based on being in his company made me totally blind and unaware of my projections.","blind and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"totally blind and unaware","blind",NA,"totally",0
"hdtxhf7","The brokers that do not have shares can see that their customers ""own"" shares, so another POV is to force the owner to sell. Remember the automatic stop loss that brokers set in February? Same goes for Take Profit. For new purchases by etoro an automatic take profit used to be set and you as a buyer would have to remove it. Granted it was something like 500% but we know that those are rookie numbers.

If an owner of a synthetic share would sell (either by own will or forced by broker) then the brokers obligation for that share disappears.

I wonder if a broker could show an artificial price for its user base so it could shake paper hands and keep these trades a secret, sort of a dark pool but completely inside the brokers house, DTCC uninvolved and unaware of such tactics. Would this be possible? Surely it would be illegal, but I am not sure they care about legal consequences anymore since the fines are a joke for them, or the ""cost of doing business"".

"hdoz2ev","Yes!!! I agree 100%. Took a huge bong rip of some top shelf weed after coming out of a full blown psychosis.. like a really bad one. Where I hallucinated dozens of people in my house, even police. I ran down the street. Got sent to the hospital, it was bad. But as I was saying... got home from the ER. Took a huge bong rip, and I very quickly became very confused and unaware of my surroundings. My mom happens to call my phone just as this was happening, and I can remember it exactly, I was sitting in my living room on the couch, and I pick up the phone and ask her “who’s kitchen am i in?” She told me I was in my house... and I just couldn’t get a hold of where I was. Asked again “yeah but who’s kitchen am I in?” *long pause* and I could sense her worry about my mental health in that very moment. And followed up with another stupid question “do I sound like I’m on drugs?” And she softly replies.. “well no... but you sound really confused” and that was almost comforting to hear because that’s exactly what I was! I replied “I am. I just don’t know where I am”. She then asked if she could drive to my house to sit with me, and I very eagerly welcomed it. After all I was extremely out of it, and that’s a little scary. She then told me one last thing before coming over and that was “DO NOT GO OUTSIDE” it was the coldest night of the year that night, and my very recent hospital trip from psychosis happened because I was outside in the cold and layed down on the sidewalk, until a passerby saw me and thought I was having a seizure. I reassured her I wouldn’t go outside. The 15-20 mins it took for her and my dad to drive over, was the perfect amount of time I apparently needed to lay down and close my eyes and fall asleep. Waking up to them knocking on my front door. No longer disassociated with my surroundings.

As the effects started wearing off, the top left window started growing larger and harder to ignore. Eventually I actually sorta climbed through the window, and I was back sitting on the couch I started on, but still completely disoriented and unaware of who exactly I was.

Wild ride. Glad I did it though.

"hcorxok","You're moving in the right direction for feeling something about it. If you want to avoid those feelings understand this please.

1. Your partner may have ADHD &amp; people with ADHD respond to sex differently, some people don't think of this because of how hard people like us and other with mental health tend to mask alot, where they hold themselves so together that when they relax and you see the real them it can be a little jarring, BUT that's how they work, if you love them you'll let it be a growing experience about boundaries.

2. Boundaries are important &amp; so is communicating them. You feel like you have crossed one of those, ask him if it felt a tiny bit like that, and try not to take it personal, alot of people will mask away so many things, being with BPD we can understand this the most because sometimes it feels like you're different people in different environments, but that's masking for you, it can go either way low energy masking or high energy. I tend to get manic highs &amp; my gf is an introvert with ADHD so sometimes I feel like WAYYYY WAYYYY too much and it kills me, but then when she finally talks I understand she's just in her head, she dealing with her own stuff her way, maybe she's just tired also you know? It's hard to think of anything else, but what reaction we wanted or expected from them. Talk to him about when you are able to touch him or when he wouldn't like it, take his word for it and he has reasons. Also ask what consentual touch he's okay with or ask if he'd like to be asked for consent, some get jarred by just being touched all the time.

3. Don't expect the energy of the relationship to always be high energy, you will get sad when it reaches a normal low or even he's not so capable of giving you affection for whatever reason. I don't wanna be rude, but this post reminds me of when I was younger and unaware of my BPD, when I thought the sex was going down and they started kinda rejecting advances even though we were super super sexual in the beginning and I didn't want the energy to stop and that triggered me Everytime, I always got this sinking feeling from my heart to my feet when things like that would happen or if I got a reaction that made me feel any less than super lovey dubey. But when I wanted alone time or when my energy was finally low, everyone else something was wrong with me and since nothing they say could help me at that exact moment, they'd get frustrated and say something's wrong with me and leave and tell everyone how crazy emotional I am hahah. Kinda hurt saying that not gonna lie 

4. It's not the end of the world even though it feels like it, now as we both know you have VERY VERY passionate emotions, just as I do, BUT that being said, we cannot keep chugging along without considering coping mechanisms. You will naturally want to vent to your bf, but consider that he like any normal human being has a limit to how much they can carry mentally you know, so do you. Try anything you can to try to learn to cope once in a while, I promise you will thank yourself. If we only use our partner for a journal they're going to start feeling our pain &amp; I wouldn't want anyone to resent you because they got overwhelmed. I've been through it countless times, I always thought wow when I actually get sad people leave or don't want me, but I always made it about myself and how I feel 24/7 since my feelings felt so huge compared to everyone. Try talking with him about how he sees everything, we all experience the puppy love faze x1000, but some people finally get comfortable, as well as being themselves around you, which not might be so sexual. 

5. The last thing is perspective. You will have your lows or moments that you don't want to be sexual or even maybe you feel that 180 that happens every once in a while and you don't feel sexual in the least and want to be alone or maybe just held, if he tries to get sexual with you in those moments, that's a perfect moment to set boundaries, which you are entitled to just as he is, just remember maybe he feels like not being touched or maybe he's overstimulated or overwhelmed or who knows, maybe he's dissociating about past traumas. Maybe he's anxious even, it's all about talking to them, &amp; NOT shutting down because of how we feel. That's where coping mechanisms come into play, they can be anything from splashing cold water on my face, to listening to this specific song, while rubbing my chest and neck slowly, which a little embarrassing I do all the time, I go to the shower or outside and cry it out or whatever I feel like I need.


btw the song is ""Head in the Ceiling Fan"" by title fight, it feels like a lullaby that no one ever sung to me, the guitar feels like it's crying with me at points, sometimes through the song it sounds like what my emotions feel like inside, even the part when I'm calming down.

"hcmz193","I'm so sorry OP. You must be so flooded with information right now
 I'm just imagining your brain on a frenzy, building new neural pathways that link areas of your brain that have never been connected before.

If that's the case, it's so... it's such an emotionally busy experience, to start making sense of things in a new way.

I want you to know that your tears are good. The ability to cry isn't just good, it's an exceptional human adaptation. Did you know that the act of crying- especially loudly crying- engages our parasympathetic nervous system? That's our body's easy of soothing all the agitated, sympathetic nervous system energy in your body when you're being flooded with too much emotion all at once.

Emotionally neglected kids learn to shut down instead of cry, for risk of being more abandoned than they already are. Crying if a beautiful thing our body's can do for us, but in certain circumstances- like being a small dependent child of a detached, zoned out or punishing parent- it's safest not to. Crying is actually a resource we all have, and which children apply exceptionally well so long as we don't teach them to fear doing so.

Our bodies are actually really good at subconscious threat assessment. I've read that as much as 80% of the brain's processes might be outside of conscious awareness. Consciously, it might not seem like something has shifted, but something must have for your body to feel safe enough to cry.

Whatever it was you did OP, you created enough safety for all the unconscious, defensive parts of you to relax, and just let you *be.* 

That being said, crying might feel incredibly scary to you. It might have been the kind of thing that was overtly punished in your home growing up. Or it might have been more covert; maybe when people cried in your home, they were left alone until they were calm again. *Not* crying might have been the only way to secure company of any kind.

So not only has your brain likely coded crying as a ""threat "" the very physical experience of it is something you've had little experience with it in the last decade. New things are always at least a little bit scary.

But the parent in me is so, so excited that you are crying. This is where healing happens. This is where relief will come from, if you haven't experienced some relief from those cries quite yet. This is *you.* Not that ""you"" are crying, but you *are* **feeling.** Fully and deeply.

It's a scary thing, to feel that much.

But it's also the key to thriving and feeling as fully alive as possible. 

This is hard stuff for kids. It's doubly hard for those of us who often feel like kids in grown-up bodies, because no one taught us how to feel and honor our feelings when we were *supposed* to be getting that help.

And it's so not fair that you have to go through this now.

But you're doing a really good job. A *really* good job.

And know that it's ok to hate us. Maybe you kind of wish you could turn back the clock, and go back to being numb and unaware of some of these things. I've felt that way on and off, to be honest. 

Know too that no feeling will ever last forever. In fact, when we're able to sit with our feelings and let them know through us like waves without interruption, they usually last about 90 seconds. That's it. It's our tendency to suppress our feelings with inhibitory emotions like shame, guilt and anxiety that prevents us from experiencing the full wave of that emotion, and getting the feelings of relief at the end.

All of this is a lot, so please just know that it isn't going to be like this forever. I'm still not living a perfect life or anything, but I can absolutely tell you that I am much, much better than I was a year and a half ago. 

Being gentle with yourself might be a hard thing for you as it is for many of us, but please be as gentle with yourself as you can right now. You may look still outwardly, but you are very busy on the inside- feeling things, processing a backlog of memories you didn't have the resources to handle as a small child, and quote literally rewiring your brain.

It's slowly grown over time, but I don't feel like it's fully fledged yet, nor do feel like I'm a good enough writer to tackle it yet. But I know it's *""the one""* because it  won't leave me alone, and I feel very deeply drawn to it. I think it's because it's the story that most broadly wrestles with the themes I find myself drawn to.  The story would best be suited for TV instead of film though, as it is rather large (3 seasons would be perfect).  The story is called Beyond the Grove. Below is a little world building from it. 

**'BEYOND THE GROVE' - WORLD**

*'In the beginning, there was one creator, a God. He created a world unfathomably large that, was at its core, perfect. And this creator existed on the highest plane of reality within this world. He possessed well over a thousand senses (I.E: sight, etc.) and could perceive reality in a way well beyond our comprehension.*   
*And in this world, he created iterations of himself to inhabit it. Each iteration, each being, was unique and had a specific purpose that brought new life to the world. Some of these beings were larger and carried more responsibility, and thus, were given more senses and a greater ability to perceive and operate in the vastness of the world. Others however, had fewer senses, but, instead, were vast in number, and thus were able to pay attention to details that others could not. Although the lowest of the beings lacked the senses to see the world for all it was, they understood the will and purpose of it all because they could feel it – because they directly connected to the creator.*     
   
        	*The creator eventually though, created another being, one that was not an iteration of himself, but instead one that was molded by him. And he created this new being with a mere five senses, and he required them to grow in order to eventually bring a new kind of life to the world. He created a separate world, which was a much smaller, physical world where the beings lived.*  
*These new beings were loved immensely by the other god-like beings. They were innocent, young, different and full of a new kind of life they had never seen before. And as the new beings grew over millions of years, the lesser god-beings were constantly around, teaching them everything within the physical realm. However, the new beings knew and felt that there was more. And after they were taught all that was within the physical realm of possibility, they desired to experience what was beyond. The god-like beings, however, knew that the new beings weren’t ready to move beyond the physical world, but the logic for why was beyond their understanding. The new beings thus became unhappy that more of existence was being kept from them and inevitably grew bitter and lustful. Eventually, they became consumed with their desire, and forcefully tried to enter the world beyond them. They waged war and tried to bring their physical selves into the spiritual world, a world much larger than the one in which they existed.  They attacked and infiltrated the world that wasn’t meant for the living, but as they attacked, they lost themselves. They became lost and stuck while chasing a shadow of what was beyond.  They were stuck in a world between reality and a spiritual existence.  They were living on the crust of a much larger existence and losing touch with what made them who they were in the physical world, but more importantly lost the feeling of love that originally led them.  And over time, they grew weaker and weaker as they became consumed with lust and hatred for what was beyond.  Eventually, they became mere shadows of their prior existence.*    
*And in their time of war, the betrayal caused the god-like beings to fall out of love with the new beings (herein called shadow beings).  And this loss of love spread to the highest echelons of the god-like beings until it finally reached the creator himself.  But the creator himself did not fall out of love for the fallen beings. There was a period of mourning, however, from the lesser god-like beings, who eventually came to forgive the new beings, hoping they would eventually see the error of their ways.  They hoped they would return to their initial purity and see the meaning, the lesson, that could not be taught or shown.*   
*But in this time of mourning, the creator made another life that was separate from the god beings and separate from the shadow beings and called them humans. However, while the god-like beings loved humankind, they were scarred from their prior experiences with the shadow beings, and thus decided, instead, that it was best to love them from a distance. And so, instead of revealing themselves to humanity, they left them blind – unaware that there was more beyond the physical world that the humans inhabited.*   
*Eventually, however, the knowledge of humanity’s existence became known to the shadow beings. And the shadow beings soon realized that there was, in fact, an opportunity for themselves within humanity. They knew the god-like beings loved humanity immensely, and moreover, they knew that they could use this love they felt against the god-like beings. They knew that if they returned to the physical world, the god-like beings would follow in order to keep humanity pure and unaware of what was beyond. So, realizing they could re-level the playing field in the physical world, and could use humanity as their pawns in their war against god, the shadow beings returned and made a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world (Earth).  This supernatural connection to the world (Earth) brought with it an energy that hadn’t be seen in the physical world in millions of years and had massive implications to the world.*        
*From humanity’s perspective, however, this change simply began as an explosion of giant tree growth. When it initially started, it began as what seemed to be just a resurgence in old growth forests across the planet, but as the speed of the growth picked up, the trees began to sprout up everywhere.

People tried to cut the trees as quick as they could, burn them, but as they did, they only grew back faster and stronger.  Society quickly fell as most land became essentially inhabitable.  Years later, the people that survived discovered parcels of land within the woods where that they could build and farm upon, and the remainder of humanity settled upon these scattered pieces of land with hopes of rebuilding civilization. But unbeknownst to them, the world had changed much more than they thought and more than just giant trees lurked in the woods.

"hcecmc7","Teen girls always get hated while the men have their pen!s pass accepted. 

A bit unrelated but I remember watching a video about the truth of lil tay and it was actually the teen brother controlling her and telling her what to do while the mother just sat around and let him exploit his sister for views and money. One of the most liked comments on the video was from some guy with an anime pfp and his comment went along the lines of “It’s obviously the mother's fault, not the brother. The court favors mothers and if she was with her father, this wouldn’t have happened.”  Along with several other comments defending the brother because “he’s only 16!! He’s allowed to be selfish and unaware of what he’s doing!” But I 100% bet if the brother happened to be a sister and lil tay was a boy, the sister would get hated on so much and people would be like “She should know better!” “Prime example on how women get away with everything.” “Why are women so selfish and self centered? You don’t see men doing this.” “Teen girls really are the worst.”

I remember seeing something posted on this sub like “a man's finger will always find a woman to blame.” And the more I hear about teen girls and women in general getting hated on for something that they were completely innocent in the more I believe it. Women literally get blamed for everything while men and women will literally make up so many excuses for men and come to his defense.

"hcdotym","I can't stand it when people say 'I miss the old Taylor.' I love her earlier music, I am very nostalgic for when I listened to it as a teen, but her earlier albums are so indicative of the kind of kid she was: in many ways naïve, ignorant and unaware of the world. Her love songs are so conservative, and represent a world view she just doesn't hold anymore. I can't imagine wishing someone who has learned, matured and grown so much in the last few years to be an adult woman with confidence and certainty about her politics and sexuality, would go back to being the naïve and innocent teen girl she has worked so hard to leave behind. 

On that though, this is also why I get tired when people say 'unpopular opinion, All Too Well isn't as good as xyz.' I personally think it can't really be compared. Both her and her writing skills have grown leaps and bounds since the writing of ATW, so of course so so many of her newer songs, especially on Folklore and Evermore, are lyrically, musically and technically better. But ATW was a phenomenal, raw and vulnerable song for someone of her age and experience, and I think it's unfair to compare them.

I spoke with my BF aswell as had him read each and every comment. Good and bad. I figured before we get into things I should clarify some things.

1. Somehow on my original post people were under the influence he locked me in the room when he would go to leave or when we were having sex. The door is unlocked before he comes to undress me, it stays unlocked until after we're finished. (He confirmed this) I am never locked inside the room or kept inside.

2. The door to the room is locked because I don't live with him, atleast not yet. I asked him if I could see the room and he gladly opened the door. It's just a white, drywalled room with linoleum floor. The same room I see everytime he takes the blindfold off and he walks me out. It is not a rape dungeon like some people implied.

3. ""When he's leaving, he's letting somebody else go it and have sex with you"" or something along those lines. I've been with my BF for long enough to know what he smells like, what his hands feel like, what his grunts sound like and every other little thing you learn about somebody after you've been with them for long enough. He's also very well endowed. It's him, I know it's him 100%. I don't need to set up a video camera to find that out.

4. ""Your boyfriend is a rapist"" uh no? I dont know what I expected but he isn't. He's very caring and always makes sure I'm doing okay inside and outside of this specific thing. He would never do that to me or anyone else.

Now onto our talk. I told him what I had done and the responses I had gotten. I got out a laptop and we looked at the whole thread. We talked about it and I think we're better for it.

1. Why do you enjoy it?
""The trust you have in me to allow me to do that with you is a big turn on. I also enjoy the power dynamic of you being helpless and unaware of what's going to happen, while I get to decide when and how things happen.""

2. Why do you leave the room so many times?
""When I leave the room, I'm getting into character. It helps me get into the right mindset."" He also wanted to add, ""No, I'm absolutely not having other people have sex with you like some comments said.""

3. Why do you stand around me like a predator before you go for me?
""I saw a scene in Shindler's List and thought, while sick in context, it could be hot with the right person. That person's you. I do it because it lets you know I'm there and builds anticipation for whats going to happen next.""

4. Should we do some more research on this and make a safeword? 
""I realize now I probably put you in a difficult situation. I'm sorry about that. I think we should both do some more research and better prepare ourselves for things like this.""

That's about it. I think we both learned alot today and we're going to try to figure things out.

"hc1e6kz","The way I see it there are several problems that just keep adding up:

1. It feels like her lore is a bit too similar to Sona. Seraphines kit was already seen as too similar given that they are both music champions, but then her lore comes around and she is another floating, musical empath that tries to unite her people with the power of music.
2. Her lore feels like it misses its biggest potential by ignoring the fact that Seraphine can hear the brackern, her original lore portrayed that as a big deal only for it to suddenly shift into a ""lets unite Piltover and Zaun""-story all of a sudden. The updated version fixed this, but it still feels like a missed opportunity.
3. In general it feels like her lore is a bit bland. She wants to unite the 2 cities and thus sings songs about it and that is about it. She doesn't seem to struggle with anything really and I don't think that her songs will really bring about a big change in the conflict. It might inspire people to take a more active role in the future, but that doesn't make Seraphines own lore more interesting. 
4. She comes off as painfully naive and unaware of the big social and political problems of the relationship between the 2 cities.

Personally I would have made her lore about the problems with the modern showbusiness and money. Make it so that her parents gathered a huge debt by moving to Piltover and then making Seraphines headphones and they are essentially now relying on Seraphine making a ton of money with her songs or otherwise they'll have to move back to Zaun (or might get killed by their loan shark). In this case Seraphine would struggle between doing what is right and what would help her make money for her parents. Or really you could cut the money part and just have her struggle to become the biggest star in PnZ to spread her message of peace between the cities instead of just having her start there.",1631092010,"she comes off as painfully naive and unaware of the big social and political problems of the relationship between the 2 cities.","naive and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"painfully naive and unaware","naive",NA,"painfully",0

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/phtzt8/how_wellknown_were_tolkiens_works_in_the_ussr_or/hbruqu5/

I would like to add a few tidbits.

There is some hard-to-verify information that The Hobbit has been put into the publishing plans of Detizdat (State Publishing House for Children's Literature) for 1941-1943, but the war has prevented this. It's unproven until someone looks up closely in the archives of this publishing house, but not 100 % implausible. By that moment, fairy tale books have been somewhat rehabilitated, first the folktales, then the author fairy tales, too. 

It's not altogether impossible, though that it would have been a loose adaptation rather than a close translation. That was, after all, the treatment applied to Pinocchio, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, or Doctor Dolittle - all of these adaptations have become Soviet children's classics (The Adventures of Buratino, The Wizard of the Emerald City, Doctor Aibolit/Owithurts respectively) and completely overshadowed the originals. Some even had sequels of their own. So it's not hard to imagine the Soviet Hobbit getting multiple sequels completely unrelated to The Lord of the Rings, and their author unaware of its existence.

The sole source of this info (in Russian, of course) is here, in a 2012 LJ conversation about the 1966 animated Hobbit:
https://petro-gulak.livejournal.com/1103566.html?thread=8572622#t8572622
The person giving it is a philologist from St Petersburg, and it doesn't look like they were pulling someone's leg. They even quote the editorial annotation written for the publishing plan:

&gt;A humorous story about the little men - the Hobbits. They tend to like comfort and quiet life, but sometimes they venture on journeys and do heroic deeds. Thus, a modest and well-intentioned Hobbit, Mr. Bilbo Baggins, goes to battle with a monstrous dragon to win the hoard. The book is illustrated by the author who has ingenuity and imagination.

The Samizdat translations were a fairly minor thing, and as far as Samizdat was going, fairly inoffensive.

A fair bit of the first print run of The Keepers (The Fellowship of the Ring) has been shipped outside the USSR, to the Soviet bloc countries like Hungary, Czechoslovakia or GDR. The copy that I have at home has been brought from Hungary.

The delay in the publishing of The Two Towers and The Return of the King is commonly explained by the worsening of the Cold War, by a (probably apocryphal) comparison of the USSR to Mordor that Reagan has made, or by the bad standing of the two translators themselves (Muravyev and Kistyakovsky) who had links to the dissident movement. Whatever it has been, it would never be mentioned in the official correspondence. Some more innocuous reasons would be given instead. Typically, if publication was refused, it was on the grounds of the planned economy's workings: that there was just no paper neither printing capacities allotted, or that the quota on authors from the capitalist countries has been filled already for this year, or that paying hard currency for the publishing rights is economically unfeasible, etc. Unless someone looks into the publishing house's archives, we'll never know.

The explosion of Tolkien translations (and explosion it was - I can possibly name no less than five translations published in one decade) and published fanfics in the 90s was only possible because the international IP laws were loosely enforced or not enforced at all back then, and the right holders didn't really care about the Russian publishing market back then.

Unlike your typical fan fiction, erotic themes were taking the back seat (if they appeared at all) in the Russian one. The Russian culture of Tolkien fanfics has developed largely independent and unaware of the Anglo-American one. It was going that way even after internet has become common enough at the major universities at least ('common' doesn't mean that it's easily available for the hobbies, though). The point of most fanfics was to rehabilitate such and such character (the second best known fanfic, The Black Book of Arda does that with Melkor and Sauron themselves, making out of both some angsty animé protagonists), to explore the corners and ages of Middle-earth that Tolkien has left unexplored, or to provide some vehicle for national resentment (that's largely what The Last Ringbearer is about).",1631012068,"the russian culture of tolkien fanfics has developed largely independent and unaware of the anglo-american one.","independent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"largely independent and unaware","independent",NA,"largely",0

You’re implying that guns in general are the weapons you’re referring to - if this is the case, cool, and if not please clarify if you mean some subset of firearms. 

So do you have evidence of this claim? It sounds pretty outrageous to me. 

Also I agree that almost all white supremacist terrorists and many fascist gang members have firearms, and want to add that those folks want to do a mass murder with those firearms. But I have a question: if they follow through with their murderous intentions on a wide scale, is it better for all of their leftist and liberal opposition to be unarmed and unaware of how to use weapons to defend themselves?

"hbuefvt","I'm sorry but you need to prioritize your children over your wife's dream and her 1st world problem melodrama. It sounds to me that she is a bit delusional and unaware of the reality of your guy's financial responsibilities. Sure she might be in need of emotional support but that does not mean her happiness is your responsibility, nor does it mean that building a whole house will necessarily make her happy if she can't be happy with what she already has. If she really is ""just looking for emotional support"" then you can give that in many other ways, but her implying that the ONLY way you can provide emotional support is by giving her her dream is plain manipulative, sorry. 
 If she wants to build a whole new house, how did she plan to contribute? Or was she expecting you to pay for the whole thing and for you to build the whole thing? I understand she only makes 10-14 K a year, and nothing is wrong with that if she's mostly a stay at home mom...but the financial stability falls onto you, you already pay for the bills and the wellbeing of the entire family as it is. She needs to understand that there's only so much one person can do making 100k a year, and making a house simply because her friend did and she thinks it sounds great is not a good enough reason to risk financial instability for you or your children, who I'm guessing you're planning to send to college. Paying off the bills and saving for three kids is already enough pressure as it is and she doesn't have to experience that. I find it wild how she is expecting you to pay for the majority of her expensive dream.
Sorry if this came off as judgemental but I really feel strongly that your wife is being somewhat self centered, delusional and ungrateful for the family unit and home that she already has.

Vivi and Momo are both heirs adored by the people, their fated role is to govern their nations, but we are getting to a stage in the story where the enemy will be much beyond the local tyrant, and all their efforts and that of the SHs in ending local (national) oppression will be for nothing if the global system of oppression is not brought down. The real enemy is not Crocodile or Kaido, it is the WG itself. In a way, this vindicates Oden, as his flashback shows him adventuring with Roger while his nation is falling to Kaido, so he is made to look irresponsible and unaware of what the real threat is. In reality, his efforts as part of Roger's crew are what laid the road for the SHs to take on the real enemy of Wano, its ancient enemy from since the Void Century, the WG itself. And Momo, as his successor, would be taking the next, final step in that battle alongside the next Pirate King. As for ruling Wano, he can do that after the journey is over. At the current time, he is mentally a child and is unfit for the role. Wano can still be immediately brought under Kouzuki rule again under Hiyori, who would frankly be much better suited for the task at the moment.

Because I believe that if human work becomes obsolete, so should human suffering. Not because I believe that the best way to organize an economy is central planning not because I am naive to the practicality of trying to create a healthy non-caoitalist state in a world where capitalist already control all the means of production and people are unwilling and unaware of the potential to change that orthodoxy. 
Simple truth: those in power cannot currently and have never been willing to utilize that power for true egalitarian humanitarian goals. They cannot be trusted to operate a state in which power is rested in the hands of government instead of private individuals.
Simple truth: private individuals will not allow their resources to be seized in order to allocate them in an egalitarian manner. 
Simple truth: resources being spread so thinly that no one person or organization controls at any given point a  billion dollars worth of capital would slow down the global economy immensely and decrease the rationality with which that wealth is used. 
As such, at this time, the best models for the economy we have in order to achieve the goals of peak wealth, peak freedom, and peak inclusion are not socialist and not pure capitalist systems, but Keynesian social democracies, which even still, rely upon international inequity to power their economies. 
On top of all of this, we cannot be trusted to even resist this system as most men's value of human life is very affordable. What's to stop someone from killing say, AOC? And then what's to stop that person from being rewarded in prison? Which might I add, is quite a cushy place thanks to the same hippies who need those places to weaken humans natural immoral instincts. 
You believe in a simple lie, that without inequality, humans will be good, willing to maintain equilibrium. 
Or, you believe that there is someone who can operate the system that oppresses people for their own good who would try to help everyone. 
Neither of these things are true. As such, we need factionalism, we need private interests as a motivational factor, we need force to defend against those who concentrate power in their hands. As Karl Marx believed, conflict for power is what drives societal change.  Unlike Karl Marx believed, people do not stop seeking that power because they have achieved equality. We all believe we are special and deserving, right and therefore good. We all fear each other's motives and potential actions. As such, we will never be equals, because we will never allow it.

So a person with schizoaffective disorder might truly believe there are demons in the room but they are going to be staring at and reacting to those demons not trying to look disconnected and unaware of their surroundings. They also tend to cling hard to proof of reality to prove it. If he was having a true delusional episode he'd be gripping the phone. The desk. His clothes. Asking demand questions and trying to prove falsehoods. Again not disconnected and airy. The people that do look like that are heavily sedated and generally not in an active episode or are high. That seems unlikely given that he had an appearance today and being that out of it would be noticed by officials who would have some very tough questions for staff.

"hbataji","What did people of other faiths do wrong? Or women do wrong? It’s not that these groups have done things wrong, it’s just that the people in power, generally white, cis males, want to make it easier to retain power so people who share similar traits are more likely to gain access to those positions than other groups. This creates an inherent bias in all of societies systems that discriminate against those who are different than those in power. 

Online, it’s a different story. It’s not that the communities themselves are hateful, they attract people who are hateful. For instance, if I’m going to bully someone, will I bully the kid who is 50lbs heavier and 6”4’ or the kid who weighs 50lbs less and is 5”3’? It had to do with vulnerability, as well as the reactions they get. Gender identity, like this, is so incredible personal. Attacking it is a) an easy target that b) gets a massive reaction, exactly what the people who hate online want. They just want to make someone else’s day shitty, and they’re weak, pathetic, and unaware of their own vulnerabilities that they have to go after some of the most vulnerable people to feel strong. It’s also easier to be hateful online. You have, for the most part, complete anonymity, and it’s easy to forget you’re interacting with another human. A perfect storm for being as shitty as possible.

I’m sorry you’re scared, I really am. I get it. I’ve been out with makeup on once and I had enough stares and negative reactions that when I do go out now, I wear sunglasses to hide my face and identity. It takes time, and it will be slow, but by doing this more, this being us being who we are, we slowly break down those walls, we change what is acceptable. We pave the way for future generations to have it ever so slightly easier. And know that what you are is beautiful. Every act of us being ourselves is, in a small way, a protest against society, a changing of the mould, and that… that’s how things change.",1630579493,"they just want to make someone else’s day shitty, and they’re weak, pathetic, and unaware of their own vulnerabilities that they have to go after some of the most vulnerable people to feel strong.","pathetic, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"pathetic , and unaware","pathetic",NA,NA,0
"hbasc12","If this can help you anyhow I'm gonna answer about myself and some people I know:

So for self-preservation 2

1) My body language is really poor. I'm clumsy and unaware of what my body is doing. I often hear I've got my mouth open all the time like I was constantly sad or tired. When I'm standing I don't move my legs or arms at all. I'm like a stiff doll who only moves her head. Frequent complains about me is that my eyes turn so big, open and round when listening to someone it's scary. Also my friends report I tend to put my face almost into theirs when I'm paying attention (mostly when I'm shorter than that person).

2) Outwardly my speech is very indirect. I often use single words, hints and rely on people being forced to guess what I mean to make them more focused on me. When one-on-one with someone I'm talking like I was telling a story, lecturing, encouraging someone to visualise what I mean in a colorful, emotionally driven way.

For 1

1) I often see them standing and walking with confidence. Nothing too try-hard, but fair body presentation. Some expressive, practical gestures and smooth moves.

2) Straight to the point with decent reasoning to back up their claims. Sometimes using others' emotionality to touch their conscience or morality. Dry humor and stoic way of speaking (well modulated accordingly to atmosphere). Patient in whose turn is to speak and they easily adjust their involvement in discussion.

For 3

1) Energetic and colorful body language. Very smooth. Often steals someone else's gestures or words. Some of them appear cartoony or theatric. Pronounced emotional expression. Uses variety of ways to stand, sit, can be a show-off doing mundane tasks.

2) Goes in both ways. Some are literal and blunt, some are making every conversation about them and stem from subject for as long as they can. Witty, engaging, often adjusted speech accordingly to a person.

For 4

1) RBF most of the time, quick to go from one edge (resting) to another (impulsive action). Frugal with movements, has subtle outburst of mini reactions like half-second expressions.

2) Deadpan snarker, many times speaking in a way that can be seen as disturbing backtalking, uses provocative language, willingly calls out whatever seems inconsistent, stubborn and defensive when in the center of conversation. Impulsive and driven to ""win"" the conversation. Arrogance and laughing increases the more shame others seem to show.

For 5

1) Controlled-uncontrolled relationship with body. Often wanting to appear certain way but doing this in a fluffy, too loose or too try-hard way. Easily disturbed, looks around many times when not talking, engaged and polarizing attitude when explaining something. Confidence showed mostly when correcting others.

2) Slightly disorganised speech. Can leap from one subject to another not engaging the listener properly beforehand. Self-centered talking which resembles internal dialogue. Detached and specific way of expressing thoughts.

For 6

1) Has a taught way of walking or standing that mimics what fits the situation objectively. Body language seems scripted, relying on pattern and manually controlled. Hyperalerted and highly guarded holding itself in a given shape. Somewhat stiff as well.

2) Firm when well informed and in touch with reaction, perplexed when facing spontaneous twist. Overall polite, subtly testing the chemistry between itself and people. Many times edgy and obsessive depending on experiences.

For 7

1) Light, passionate body language. Smiles a lot and hold smile for long. Throws many surprising moves. Excitable and connected with current atmosphere. Needs to have hands preoccupied.

2) Direct and over-the-top. No hestitation, often changes mind, adds more interpretations to already said words. Uses branching when speaking and tries to come into unexpected conclusions.

For 8

1) Either unhinged or stoic body language. Instant responses, carries itself with more than obvious certainity. Seems to be thinking while skipping thinking in head and directly using body.

2) Elaborates only when facing clear misunderstanding. Blunt, puts time pressure on people when talking, has multiple interpretations in check, seems to have answers for everything instantly.

For 9 I don't know. There's so much differences among 9s I have no pattern for them. Check Personality Database for literature examples.

"hbakgo8","I was you. Probably worse haha. I don’t get sad, I get mad. I was angry at the entire world! Yet I didn’t want to share my hateful side with anyone, I just randomly made people feel stupid on the internet (which I now feel terrible for), which led to even more anger at myself. And also led to physically feeling sick. Anger and hate were ruining my body and mind. Lo and behold the root of my anger was actually my hate towards my parents, so I went into it. I wrote pages filled with venom about how inept my parents were, how embarrassing it is for them, how I’m glad they never achieved shit in life etc etc. I just kept writing my hate out and feeding that fire instead of “compassionately unloading”. Fuck compassion, I needed to rage. So rage I did. For the first time I allowed my anger at them to flow with no stop and I didn’t care how evil I was even sounding I just went with it. And it was quite evil, but holding in that pain was killing me.

How cathartic! Why didn’t anyone tell me to do this before?! Yes, I didn’t feel like a very loving person when I was doing it, and it almost felt wrong, but my god. After the rage letters I was able to write a letter of forgiveness, that’s how light I felt. I had realized my parents were just plain dumb, had their own trauma, I felt bad for them for being so lost and unaware of love and kindness. They were the ones to feel sorry for, not me. At least I am the type of person who could NEVER do what they did, so somehow their shitty parenting actually made me better than them. I also rage journaled about other things that pissed me off in the world and that also made me release any care for them. They don’t even phase me anymore! Wave that trump flag! See how much I care! -insert maniacal laugh- Whenever I would get triggered by something or someone, I just rage journaled, and afterwards I was able to look at those same things with eyes of forgiveness and detachment. I have no idea why this worked but for an inherently angry person it was what I needed more than meditation, yoga, and therapy (which did nothing for my anger — and I’m a yoga teacher haha).

"hb8r2vy","I'm a Preacher Kid you don't really get a choice in your religion. Much like she probably didn't get one for her religion. The beatings shall commence until you memorize this passage. I wouldn't exactly call that a chosen faith. lol  


You feel free to go and marry a divorce person, it's no skin off my back. You are the only one that has to live with your own life decisions.  
In fact I would be extremely happy if you did, because then it's one less of them in the dating pool.

  
You are free to think of me whatever you wish, it makes zero difference to me. Just as anyone else who I don't know on a one to one basis opinion does. And even the ones I do know personally I rarely give a crap what they think either. It's an earned right for your opinion to mean anything to me.  


Allowing random peoples opinion's to sway you after all is how you get caught up losing yourself and living a life you'll regret.  


And my post had nothing to do with giving her crap, I was simply offering her other perspectives, I thought that was the point to asking questions like this to strangers so that you could gather various perspectives and opinion's on the matter. You know that whole informed decisions thing.  


The most harmful thing you can do to another person as an INFJ is keep them in the dark and unaware of all of the possibilities. Especially if you know for a fact that they exist. It's why I stopped coddling people personally. Or did this world become perfect well I slept last night and I am simply unaware that we all get whatever we want and dream of with no suffering or sacrifice involved?  
Can you guarantee that if she leaves her husband that her future will go the way she wants? The possibility exist certainly. But does not the other option for pain and suffering exist as well? I'm just attempting to keep it level and her eye's open to all of the possibilities.   
If that level of brutal honesty bothers you then I don't know what to tell you because just as the world can be good at times it also has it's pitfalls and they tend to be really harsh to those who seek to remain blind to them.  


It's OP's life at the end of the day and she can make the choice to live it however she wishes, that choice as well as her consequences has always been in her own two hands.  


She could get divorced and find someone else that is great for her, she might divorce and end up with an abusive prick. She might never find another husband, if she even ever wants to get married again. All those options exist do they not? So why would I lie to her and tell her they don't? That to me would be truly cruel to do to anyone who is looking for any answer to any question.  


So you and other people may not like my post but it is grounded in reality, I unlike a lot of people don't choose to live pretending like the world is perfect and full of genies that just grant everyone's wishes.  
Because if it was I wouldn't personally have met so many people who pretend to be fine well either self medicating or who take doctor prescribed pills to battle their constant depression to deal with the choices they made.  


So if you want to be everyone's cheer squad then by all means do so, personally I prefer to live in a state where I am aware of all of the option and angles. And I would rather not hold the guilt that would come from me being disingenuous and telling another human being that everything will work out fine when I know for a fact that it is not always the case since I as a person can not guarantee their outcome because I as a person have not chosen to be bound to that responsibility.  


So because I am not bound to OP by my own promise or words and can not with my own two hands promise to physically change her world, then it would be cruel to mislead her and to tell her such things. If you can personally promise to offer her a better life then feel free to do so. And I will happily and with no resentment bow down to you as my better.  


I've pulled plenty of women out of crappy situations in my life and offered them sanctuary, that said I will never promise them such if they leave my range and leave to follow their own path. Because only someone who is foolish will promise someone outcomes that are out of their own personal control.   
I won't waste my life trying to cage someone that wants to be elsewhere, but I won't protect them once they are gone either. The best I can offer that person is the honest truths I've witnessed in life anything beyond that is up to them.  


So you as well as everyone else can think of me whatever you wish, but I rather be honest and considered a prick then someone a person ends up loathing later because I mislead or lied to them because I wanted to be nice and fill their head with hope for something I can't guarantee.   
It's really easy to lie and be liked, it's a whole other world once you become brutally honest because you get tired of cleaning up messes that other peoples kind lies and good intentions created.  
You would be amazed at just how many people seek me out in the real world because they realize I'm not going to sugar coat it and will tell them exactly what I think of the situation they got themselves involved in. Even the ones that get mad in the moment come back eventually to thank me because they realize I wasn't trying to hurt them I was just warning them for their own sake or own benefit. And I sleep rather sweetly in that knowledge, and live a life with very few regrets.

"hb563jn","We have to use the ventilator when the patient is not getting enough oxygen while on the maximum bipap settings, or when their lungs tire out. Typically at my hospital we will intubate them based on their blood oxygen levels from a blood test known as an ABG; if the oxygen in the blood is too low and the carbon dioxide is too high it is time to intubate. We also look at the patient’s pulse oximeter level which is the 94% in the first picture, if they’re consistently staying below 90% while on 100% bipap it is time to intubate. Lastly we can tell when a patient is tiring out because their breathing becomes very rapid and shallow and they are very anxious, and  it will not improve even with Morphine, then we know it is time to give their lungs a break by putting them on a ventilator. 

While on the ventilator the patients are sedated and we keep them completely comfortable and unaware of what is going on. The machine breathes for them and allows their bodies to rest and their lungs to inhale and exhale the perfect volume and percentage of oxygen that their bodies need. 

The theme around ventilators probably isn’t optimistic because they are scary to see someone on and when people get to the point of needing them they are very sick.

1. I was way too shy, nervous and unaware of my attachment style (how it held me back) when I was in high school to ask many girls out. Alcohol helped a lot, but it's not something I'd recommend. Having age and hindsight on my side, the direct method is often the best: ""Do you want to check out (whatever) together?"" or something alone those lines. My most recent ex asked me ""Do you want to go out?"" and my head went fuzzy - I loved the directness and unambiguity of it. My first Tinder date after that relationship, I was kinda proud at my smoothness: ""I'm a bit new in town, so if you can find a place with decent cold brew, it'll be my treat.""
2. How to go from friends of a friend to friends? ""Isolate"" the friend you're looking to make by saying something like, ""You popped out of our group because you're really into (whatever) and so am I! I don't know as much about (whatever) as you do - let's go check out (event/whatever)."" (I had to put ""isolate"" in quote marks because it has a bit of a negative connotation to it in relationships, but I meant it in the positive sense).
3. Fortunately, I didn't have homophobic straight girls in the locker room at high school, so I'll do my best guess at extrapolating homophobic straight girls' comments in other situations: directly call them out on it by saying something like, ""Why did you say that? That's not cool"" or ""It's a locker room. We're getting changed. That's what locker rooms are for, and if you think anyone's doing anything more than that, I'd have to wonder why it's so front-of-mind for YOU."" Homophobic comments tend to make people uncomfortable, so put the spotlight back on her by calling her out on her shitty comments.
4. High school sucked. I was lucky to have a few friends, but for the most part, I felt like I didn't fit in. I felt awkward and had trouble relating to others, partly because of my sexuality but mostly because high school sucks and kids can be ruthless and mean. I was just biding my time until I got out. University was a LOT better and I finally felt like I was more accepted for who I was. And there were a LOT more people to talk to.

"hb2wnqq","That's why narcissism is awful for everyone involved, including the narcissist. They are actually trying to gaslight you and you are fighting against it and it ""feels"" like gaslighting. What end up happening and why they consider your words is that, internally, they're thinking ""shit, that is what they said and I have no idea how to handle this"". They may be doing it totally unconsciously and it's more than likely habits they've picked up from their family and the way they were raised. If they have a good heart, it would mostly be shown by trying to predict what other's needs are before they're communicated. It is inherrently a breakdown of communication and they'll warp and twist their own memories to reconcile their own feelings when things don't go exactly their way or they made a mistake. No one thinks they're the bad guy. This will also hinder their growth because you can't learn from your mistakes if you never thinks you make any.

One important thing to note is that these are lies. There is an old story about the truth taking a bath and leaves her clothes on the ground. Lie comes up and steals the clothes, wears them and pretends to be the truth, until the naked truth (which is where that idiom comes from) comes up and beats the shit out of Lie. The story is meant to show that the worst lie isn't just something that says it's the truth, but actually is wearing her clothes as well - it has properties of the truth. What he is doing IS lying in its most insidious form because it's so close to the truth it seems harmless, but as he believes it himself is why it's so bad - he'll use his lies over the truth as leverage. What's worse is that he'll use it against you and try to manipulate you using these false truths that he believes. This is actual gaslighting. He also may be totally powerless and unaware of it or why it's bad.

Narcissism is not something that someone just picks up one day and goes ""oh boy, I can't wait to be an asshole!"" It's a pattern of behaviors that give rise to a really shitty personality. The mental gymnastics require some massive brainpower as well, so these people are typically smarter and more successful as they weasel through negative consequences through manipulation and cleverness. They'll be fantastic storytellers, be the center of attention and will be adored when they're place on a pedestal. The sad part is that they can still be all of that, but they truly NEED it in order to keep the hollow shell they've built around themselves reinforced. Narcissists are the best people in the world to hang out with when they're in their element. They're super fun. However, the second you try to correct them or challenge then they will get really, really nasty and the worst ones will pull out every psychological trick in the book without knowing their doing it. 

I would highly recommend you approach your friend about these personality quirks and make them aware of it. It'll just get worse over time as they won't actually do anything with their life and just aggrandize stories of the most minimal efforts they do. They worked out a few times and so they're an expert body builder. They'll got in a fight so they're a martial artist. They did well on a project at work so they're the best ever and they're untouchable. It will bite them in the ass one day when someone calls them out on their shit.

The psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study ""Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"". An example derived from cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who, on April 19, 1995, robbed two banks while his face was covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make him invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was apparently based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an invisible ink

"hayrqxs","the Edgewood Arsenal Deliriants. if you know a lot about psychopharmacology, the word ""deliriant"" is enough on it's own to make you sick. deliriants are a class of hallucinogen that produce horrifying, nightmarish hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality itself. they also cause one to feel very feverish and unaware of the world around them. they work by inhibiting acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter used for memory, as well as a lot of other things that are pretty vital for having a functioning brain. deliriants are fucking horrifying chemicals that have almost no purpose for being taken in doses that cause these effects. some compounds that have deliriant effects have legitimate purposes, such as Benadryl (diphenhydramine), which has deliriant effect in doses above 500mg. a normal dose is 25mg. anyone who has taken a dose of Benadryl that high can confirm how absolutely wretched deliriant intoxication can be.  


now, the Edgewood Arsenal Deliriants are a culmination of every human person's worst fucking nightmares. firstly, they were developed as bioweapons. secondly, they have active doses in the low microgram range, meaning you can consume a dose without even being able to see it with the naked eye. secondly, they have a horrifyingly long duration of action. how long is ""horrifyingly long""?  some of them last two days or so, which alone is an extremely long amount of time for any psychoactive compound to last. however, one of which has a duration of action of FIVE TO TEN ENTIRE FUCKING DAYS. the compound with this insane duration of action is known as EA-3167.  


here's a quote from [an article](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-deliriants-of.html) about these compounds, ""The extreme power of this compound brought attention from keen eyes, with some in the military noting that its effects could be given topically, even through a handshake perhaps5. Weaponization and further studies of this compound were  eventually abandoned- perhaps because even for the boundless cruelty of the U.S. Military it was too extreme, but also because conducting human studies for such extended periods of time put strain on available study resources.""  


from my personal experience with psychoactive substances, deliriants are fucking horrifying. even being under the influence of one for 2 or 3 hours is a horrific experience that no one should ever be subjected to. the fact that there are compounds that exist that last for times as long as 240 hours is fucking insane, and it's even more terrifying that the government had developed these for the purpose of being biological weapons. the cruelty of the existence of these compounds is beyond words, and the fact that there were UNWILLING EXPERIMENTS DONE TO PEOPLE USING THESE COMPOUNDS is even scarier. i do not think any other single man-made thing will come close to the abominations that are the Edgewood Arsenal Deliriants, and specifically, EA-3167 stands above the rest as the unrivaled king of manmade horrors.",1630351570,"the edgewood arsenal deliriants. if you know a lot about psychopharmacology, the word ""deliriant"" is enough on it's own to make you sick. deliriants are a class of hallucinogen that produce horrifying, nightmarish hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality itself. they also cause one to feel very feverish and unaware of the world around them. they work by inhibiting acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter used for memory, as well as a lot of other things that are pretty vital for having a functioning brain. deliriants are fucking horrifying chemicals that have almost no purpose for being taken in doses that cause these effects. some compounds that have deliriant effects have legitimate purposes, such as benadryl (diphenhydramine), which has deliriant effect in doses above 500mg. a normal dose is 25mg. anyone who has taken a dose of benadryl that high can confirm how absolutely wretched deliriant intoxication can be.     now, the edgewood arsenal deliriants are a culmination of every human person's worst fucking nightmares. firstly, they were developed as bioweapons. secondly, they have active doses in the low microgram range, meaning you can consume a dose without even being able to see it with the naked eye. secondly, they have a horrifyingly long duration of action. how long is ""horrifyingly long""?","feverish and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"very feverish and unaware","feverish",NA,"very",0

"hat5k2x","This was probably the most feasible advice I saw on multiple websites…

“To keep cats away from gardens, flower beds, or specific areas of property, scatter fragrant items that don’t appeal to a cat’s sense of smell, like fresh orange or lemon peels, organic citrus-scented sprays, coffee grounds, vinegar, pipe tobacco, or oil of lavender, lemongrass, citronella, or eucalyptus.”

Most sources said to spray or place these items along the perimeter of your yard or along fences if you have them. 

Another solution I saw, which is obviously not as aesthetically pleasing and may be more cumbersome and I imagine could even end up deterring some birds is to put chicken wire around the area that the birds tend to congregate and eat in. It’d need to be a big enough area to give them some comfort with landing and taking off in flight quickly though. 

I think the scented deterrents sound like the best bet, or, if that cat belongs to someone and isn’t a stray, it could be worth it to talk to the owner in a kind way. Of course, some crappy pet owners will get ultra-defensive and double down…but I think that most people are just a bit naive and unaware of just how much damage outdoor cats have been doing to local bird populations. If they truly love animals, maybe finding that out would change how they let their cat roam around?

You or your partner could be asymptomatic carriers and never have known it. But none of this is meant to worry you, just to encourage you to get checked out so you and your partner know your status. If you end up being positive for HSV, your partner can also get a blood test to find out her status, although this is more for peace of mind than anything since you’re committed to one another.

"hagkzeq","I don’t care what your country did. There is no political movement to have a coordinated response to this which is precisely what this would *have* to be, which is almost a guarantee what your country did. It isn’t done by individuals. It’s implemented by states. And we cannot make our state do the most basic necessities that we want. We won’t be able to force it to do something that obviously isn’t a problem for most people since in the sectors where it matters, we already use metric. 

And our leadership boasts about this 24/7. Not most Americans. I suppose you’re ignoring the fact that mass amounts of Americans are disenfranchised from an awful voting system, in the most incarcerated country on the planet per capita that coincidentally removes voting rights from felons, deliberately makes every other citizen’s votes count differing amounts, and even then only *half* of our voting eligible population bothers voting in our biggest election because, as they will openly tell you, they know it won’t influence their lives because both parties refuse to implement any policies that help people. 

Did you happen to leave out the part that the biggest pressure on our governing party, the one that holds both halves of the legislative branch as well as the executive branch, is to pass voting rights legislation? Because all around our country republicans are passing voter suppression laws and our Dem party cannot muster the courage to seek anything but “bipartisanship” in the face of it. And that singular failure to pass voting rights legislation could cost them power for decades. 

So you saying every single American doesn’t know our democracy is failing us and we *all* aren’t aware that we are the global empire that uses “democracy” and fake concerns about “human rights” to further our imperial goals while leaving our own population to rot is so moronic and unaware of the frustrations most Americans actually feel. 

Everything you’re saying is stuff so many Americans are aware of. Our two parties are wildly pro corporation and have destroyed our labor movement for decades. There are efforts to build labor power here and it’s incredibly difficult. 

We don’t have social safety nets to protect us here and many states by law can straight up ignore labor unions. It’s wildly hard to build a labor movement out of that and that is the *only* form of “force” our people can have. 

What’s the alternative? Protests or riots? You mean like the ones that consumed our country for all of last summer and literally were met by constant violence from our police, propaganda by the news, and both parties scoff still today at the idea of *any* accountability for our police? Our police were what people were protesting. Of course our protests were met with massive violence. 

Change takes a ton of work. And we’re the global empire that has set most countries back for the last century. We’re at the heart of propaganda and corporate power and democracy is massively limited and labor power has been aggressively chipped away at. 

It’s not an easy solution. Even straight left wing countries around the world have been toppled and their populations have become reactionary after decades of propaganda. It’s not some simple thing to overcome and you act like every American just straight up wants this for ourselves. Of course if we externally do this to other nations then we can implement it internally. We had one of the most violent labor histories in the planet and had a militant labor movement early 20th century. Post war era half of our country was organized. You think we lost that by pure accident and by complete chance? You think if your people weren’t under the same historical conditions, the same wouldn’t have happened? Especially since most younger Americans weren’t alive when this was the spirit of the age that did this to us. 

Blaming every single American for a system most of us suffer from and openly know is bad is idiotic. Especially when *one comment ago* your own comment was pretending we could just will the metric system into existence. Weird flip flop on that opinion.

He told me as he was leaving after being there for hours that he had chills and a bad headache a few days earlier, but felt fine now. I was mad that he didn't tell me this, made him get tested, he was positive. I tested positive the next day.

"had7gsr","You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means. Free means without cost. Your care definitely has cost, you just seem disconnected and unaware of what that cost is, who pays, and how it's paid for, so you seem to believe it's nothing. Do you think a 10K surgery just magically dissapears over an imaginary border line? The truth is that it likely costs 15K in Canada because of the buerocracy and lack of competition.



You pay taxes every year whether or not you go to the doctor. That is same thing as medical insurance. A politician fooled you into calling it ""free"". The cost is hidden all over, including inflation, the invisible tax, but worst of all quality of service. When the government caps doctor's salaries, they stop getting competitive. Competition drives innovation and creates new opportunities to better serve.



Now that you mentioned it,, I'm glad we live in the only country without universal Healthcare. Universal Healthcare is worse for citizens, not better.



 I know that when I need something, I can get it right away, I don't have to wait. I know that the quality and service will be world class.

"hacgqr1","Great points. I have some minor additions/comments to make though 

&gt;Well, that's the thing.  Look at Abby before she killed Joel: she was the same way.  The writers did a brilliant job showing the parallels of their journeys throughout the game, by showing us Ellie as she descended into revenge and Abby as she clawed her way back out from those same depths.  They really are 2 sides of the same coin.

While their character progression is the same, I think the similarities end there. The similarities are just they both lost their father and seek revenge. The 2 sides of the coin is more fitting for Joel and Abby than it is Abby and Ellie.  

&gt;She fell into the same pattern of stopping at nothing to kill Abby, sacrificing her friendships and family in the same was as Abby did before killing Joel.  

I think it’s important to mention though that at the farm, Ellie absolutely did not want to leave. She was so broken by Abby that she didn’t know what else to do to get better. She wanted to live with her family and she was definitely over revenge. She left out of desperation to get better because she was dying and staying would’ve been suicide. So her motivation was self-preservation and even her family, but not for revenge. This is what Halley Gross, the co-writer and the person who included the whole PTSD bit even says:

""To my mind, when she’s leaving the farm it almost isn’t about Abby at that point so much as it’s about “I literally cannot survive if I don’t try and handle what’s going on because this PTSD is just getting worse, I’m losing control, I feel like I’m at risk to my family, and I have to hope that there’s an answer on the other side because I don’t know how to live with this. If I stay here it’s suicide.” It’s more a conversation about mental health and surviving than it is justice for Abby or even seeking Joel. It’s just like “I don’t know how to be a person anymore.”

I think they did a very poor job in properly showing Ellie’s motivations in why she left. This is so often misunderstood that she left her family for revenge. She left to kill Abby but not for revenge, she just wanted the pain to stop. It’s been 2 years and she’s been getting worse and didn’t know what else to do. 

&gt;And by the end, she was left with a choice.  Kill Abby in front of Lev, as Abby killed Joel in front of Ellie, and continue the cycle yet again.  Or put a stop to it once and for all, sparing Lev what both she and Abby suffered previously.  And let's face it, Lev already suffered enough by this point.  This is one reason why I truly don't understand people still wanting to kill Abby at the end.  Enough is enough.

Lev was practically unconscious and unaware of his surroundings. I think if Ellie killed Abby, the cycle still would have ended there, because she would’ve indirectly killed Lev. He wouldn’t have made it off the island alive. By letting abby go he also gave Lev his chance at life. 

And all being said, it was a very powerful choice by Ellie that I think many overlook.",1629927624,"lev was practically unconscious and unaware of his surroundings.","unconscious and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"practically unconscious and unaware","unconscious",NA,"practically",0
"hacg0jf","If I can just take a moment to gush about why I love this game for not just the gameplay but also its story.

Tales of the Rays has an amazing premise that's definitely worth experiencing via translation, it however requires at least some knowledge of every Tales game lore, as it delves into spoilers and everything is important and relevant. It's sorta gatekeepy to spoil everything in every game in the series, but that also lets it tell its story with no holds barred.

Unlike all other Tales crossover games which excuse their crossovers with ""its not canon, don't worry about it"", an amazing reason that other crossover games should utilize more often, Rays is the sole exception that can be canon without affecting the canon of any other game. Instead of taking place in an alternate noncanon reality, Rays instead takes place in a world called Tir Na Nog that uses cloning technology known as exoflection, capable of copying other worlds' entire continents at a time, with the targeted worlds being completely unaffected and unaware of the process. Thus, the characters from all the Tales games are brought to this world as clones, with memories of their original selves, but now made to live the rest of their lives in this world. It's a great excuse for crossing over all the Tales characters, as well as other properties like Guilty Gear here. Exoflection also has a process known as encoding, which converts their origin world's physics to this world's for the clones, so bodies made of something like fonons or mana are now made of atoms and molecules or chiral particles. Neat way to make everything compatible.

Exoflection is a great plot device as it isn't just an excuse to cross over, but its important to the story itself. Since everyone retains their memories, their motivations and goals are challenged by this twist to their lives, and entire reasons for conflict and alliances are made irrelevant instantly. Different relationships and conflicts arise from characters from their own world as well as between those from others as a result. The God Generals from Abyss for example have no reason to stay together, and have gone their separate ways, even fighting each other. While Yuri became a big brother figure to Luke. Not to mention being separated from those at home who weren't exoflected with them all without consent is something not everyone is willing to forgive. Their point of exoflection can differ as well. Different characters from Destiny for example were exoflected before and after a certain character's betrayal and death. Velvet from Berseria was exoflected twice, from her early game villainous revenge driven self to her end game chilled out more reasonable self. Older Velvet allied with Sorey and killed her younger self, as she was beyond salvation and reason. Kyle has revealed that he's Stahn and Rutee's son, as they're they're younger selves from Destiny 1, this information hits different. Obviously having no memories of him, their relationship is like that of long lost family only just meeting. Friendly but not as close as growing up together. Stahn lets him call him Dad, while Rutee is still processing it and is uncomfortable with being called Mom.

While being quite serious it's also the ultimate fanservice, commonly giving a happy ending to otherwise tragic stories. Characters that died are of course exoflected while they're alive and get to stay alive. Antagonists who were unable to be saved have now become friends. Like Mithos, who only ever wanted to he reunited with Martel, now has that. Martel also keeps him grounded and sane, he has since made amends with Lloyd co., as well as Yuan and Kratos. Yuan and Martel even finally got to marry. This is all still only taking with cloned characters, as their original selves in their original games still go through what they go through. But it's nice to have a canon universe where at least some other versions of them get the happy ending we wanted. Having pretty much every character from every game, the setting has only gotten more and more convoluted and harder to digest, with so many different factions. But I'm super invested.",1629927318,"instead of taking place in an alternate noncanon reality, rays instead takes place in a world called tir na nog that uses cloning technology known as exoflection, capable of copying other worlds' entire continents at a time, with the targeted worlds being completely unaffected and unaware of the process.","unaffected and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaffected and unaware","unaffected",NA,"completely",0

"ha05cid","Eula was allowed despite being from a hated family because Varka decided to give her a chance to prove herself as a defender of Mondstadt, and while the Knights do respect her for herself, common people hate her. If something, her ""old aristocratic family"" would have been a detriment instead of an advantage.

Noelle can't pass the exam because a)she's too much focused on physical strength b)too much obsessed with assisting to the point Jean worries she'll put her life in danger (which she has actually done, and even the Knights rulebook includes a section dedicated to *not give more chores to her*) and c)apparently gets too nervous and chokes at the last minute, which reflects on her performance during the exam.

Klee is probably a Knight (despite not really doing Knightly duties) because of her mom, yes, but also because she's too destructive and unaware of limits because of her age, which means she needs to be constantly watched over. And the influence of Alice is not necessarily for just having friends within the Knights (she does seem to have powerful friends everywhere), but because Alice herself is too much dangerous that Varka probably just allowed Klee in to avoid any kind of conflict with Mrs. ""Let's explode some ruins so they seem older"".

Albedo may have been also recommended by Alice, but he has proven himself with his abilities.

Jean comes from an old noble family that even during the aristocracy era was more focused in Mondstadt's well-being over the decadence other families indulged in; and yes, her family have been knights for generations, but considering the way her mother trained her I *really* doubt Jean got in because of her family's influence and not because she earned it (and I don't think Varka would have chosen her as his second in mand/potential successor just because of her nobility background; she was chosen likely because of her capability of handling non-combat related tasks that Varka never liked doing).

"h9w0ys7","This is helpful but its more black and white than that.

For example you can get people that are highly sensitive types, but are nowhere near as trusting as people think.

So just because someone is 'sensitive' in the sense they pick up emotions fast- this doesn't mean they have endless empathy to give out. Or that they're naive and unaware of whats going on.

This is like when men get super cocky thinking their girlfriend hasn't caught them cheating- meanwhile shes already checked out mentally and is on her way out. So by the time they have ended, shes already way over it and he's confused by her lack of compliance. It's all just catching up to him that shes not coming back.

And this is where narcissists often fail with nuanced people- they think because someone has high emotional intelligence, is expressive or has certain beliefs and is vulnerable in some way- they can always 'fool' these people by mirroring them.

For example- they think if a woman has no trouble being herself or outspoken...she must be super naive and trusting. Or if a woman has difficult family members- she will always stay.

Again- this as an assumption the narcissist made. And something that is rarely talked about is HOW MANY blind spots a narcissist has themselves. Not to mention how fragile their ego's are- narcissists are usually extremely easy to trigger and have many weaknesses they believe are 'hidden from view'.

If someone has ample experience dealing with a narcissist they are not going to be that impressed by them which means the narcissist will work overtime and they're not going to pull the wool over their eyes long. In fact- they may get played themselves in the process.

 Because these people are quite often blinded by their own arrogance and don't understand when they've truly overstepped the mark. They are always 'assuming' their prey is going to come back. Again, the arrogance and blind spots. 

The fact she has no trouble being herself- often means she will have no trouble getting rid of him if he starts acting up either.

Highly sensitive types can often use this emotional intelligence against the narc. They're picking up on things than an arrogant narcissist doesn't think they are. Quite often the narc will self sabotage all by themselves. 

Narcissists don't only target sensitive, shy, anxious quiet people- yes they are easier targets for them but its not like they only go for one character profile.

Quite often they get bored of that type and start targeting more confident, stubborn, outspoken people because its more of a 'challenge' for their ego. Also quite often they secretly envy these people. Especially expressive women who aren't afraid of offending somebody. Because they're not afraid to be alone with themselves like the narcissist is.

Most male narcs are always in deficit because they're not settled within themselves- which is why they constantly need new supply. Once you fundamentally understand this and see how weak they are and reliant on the external- you will become the narcs enemy number one. Because a weak person cannot truly hold power over you- if you know that they're weak under the mask.

Narcissists are ego driven and if their prey becomes too easy, that doesn't pump their ego the same, so they go looking for tougher targets. Unfortunately when they lose this supply- it will sting them harder.

They aren't too hurt if they lose 'naive' supply that they view beneath them- but if they lose supply that they knew was intelligent- this reflects failure back on them. That they're perhaps not as smart or cunning as they thought. Which is why they will go to greater lengths to impress and try to keep 'smart' supply.

Narcs like to be seen next to smart, beautiful, successful people most in public as this strokes their ego more. But they also have this internal inflict where they feel small next to them inside, and quite paranoid and anxious themselves. They have a huge fear of being rejected or controlled.

In a way this can make narcissists almost FIXATE on trying to break them down....so they can feel bigger next to them.

However they know when the second type is at full capacity- they won't even get a foot in the door so often they will target the second type when they're not at full capacity or in a great place.

Because that immediately elevates them in terms of power and allows them to temporarily feel 'superior' next to them.",1629621575,"or that they're naive and unaware of whats going on.","naive and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"naive and unaware","naive",NA,NA,0

"h9tm3cm","Maverick Hunter X. The PSP remake of the first Mega Man X game.

I like it a lot and think that it's a fun experience (it uses one of my favorite games of all time as a basis after all) but sweet jesus does it miss many of the things that made the original so **perfect** in both gameplay and story.

For starters, the game feels heavier in general. There always seems to be a little delay and ""weight"" to every single action: walking, dashing , jumping etc. and some moves had their properties greatly altered by this and feel less effective as a result (I swear the shotgun ice trick to get the heart tank on Kuwanger's stage is impossible in this version). Not a deal-breaker but noticeable if you played the original game extensively like I did.

Now for the one thing I absolutely despise... It's how they moved upgrades and armor pieces around for the sake of being different than the SNES version while, in the original game, they were strategically placed in specific places to accomodate the game's design.

The Leg upgrade is meant to be found in Chill Penguin's stage. A.K.A the stage that's immediately highlighted once you finish the tutorial. A.K.A probably the easiest level in the game and the one that most people are likely to start with. A.K.A the stage that, once beaten, changes Flame Mammoth's stage so that the lava is frozen making it easier to get the heart tank once you get there.

What did the remake do? Hide the most useful upgrade in the entire game in an area that's obscured by the camera on a stage that they will most likely visit **HALFWAY** through the game. That means that an unexperienced player could easily go through the entire game without the leg upgrade.

It's not a ""nitpick"", it's stupid design.And it's repeated throughout.And it could potentially ruin the experience for newbies.And longtime fans didn't care for it either.And you get the point.

What is a nitpick on the other hand is the fact that Vile's boss fight has a health bar and you're supposed to defeat him like a normal boss. Not game-breaking stuff but it did kinda ruin the whole ""puny character fighting unbeatable behemoth"" thing they had going in the original X. Granted, he still ends up kicking your ass but it doesn't feel the same...

The new continuity is a mixed bag. Loved Vile's character, loved the Dr. Light scenes, loved the fact that they actually bothered to explain some things about the world the characters are living in... Kinda ""meh"" about everything else.

I feel like they made the idea of ""maverick"" so much more confusing.

Are the robots sick and unaware of their actions or are they merely agreeing with Sigma's schemes, making them a lot less sympathetic and likeable? I think the game made it a lot more complicated than it needed to be, the original explanation was simpler but ten times more effective.

Not a fan of how Zero wasn't the one responsible for Sigma's corruption as I thought it was an amazing way to link the X series with the classic games, showing how Wily continues to be (indirectly) a pain in the ass for the Blue Bomber of the future.

I could go on for a long time but this is already way longer than it needs to be lmao.

Again, it's still a great game but I didn't like how they purposely ruined some things just for the sake of being different than the original game.

"h9pbi4n","Although I agree that the description of Mme Swann finishing the book is mind-blowingl by its beauty – I think one couldn't ever get bored with those proustian descriptions, always so abstract and poetic, still somewhat relatable – I don't think the narrator's obsession for Gilberte parallels in any way the madness depicted in Swann In Love. They are both story about extreme, destroying love but both in a different, almost opposite manner. Swann at the time was very well regarded amongst the Parisian – probably even in a wider range – high society. He is successful with women, he almost seems kind of bored with how easy life is to him, how he got everything he need and would, as he thinks, forever get what he desires. A man so confident logically deals with love in a completely different manner than the young adolescent we follow through Madame Swann at Home. Timid, anxious, going through the existential crisis that is symptomatic of his young age, he is frozen by his admiration for Gilberte. As a clever and sensitive boy, he overthinks, over analyses every little insignificant fluctuation occurring throughout their rather mundane and ordinary relationship; he is thus unable to proceed correctly the overwhelming load of information invading his naive mind, too young and unaware of love to respond correctly to the chaos he creates – add to this already complicated situation his introvert nature – his mechanical defense reaction is pure paralysis; trapped alone within his inner turmoil. He hopes for a miracle, that he will one day receive a letter from Gilberte confessing her burning love, as he understands he is nor capable neither willing to actively change the situation. I would admit though that he slowly adapts and learns from the situation; as he tries to escape Gilberte and free his mind from the roaring storm of emotions he gradually descended into, resigned to ever tame this storm, he finally becomes active. There, however, is more ambiguity in this relationship than it would first seem; as the narrator steps back from his love and becomes more lucid about the whole situation, we see some signs that could instill that Gilberte was somewhat interested, signs that the narrator would have never been able to decipher given the inconsistency and intensity of the thoughts and feelings he had been nourishing for now quite some time, totally clouding his perception of the relationship. Back to Swann; based on everything we know of him, such of behaviour would be unlikely. He is clearly active in his relationship with Odette, the impact of his love is much more externalized, ultimately causing an impressive downfall through high society. Another major difference between these two story is jealousy. Jealousy is what fuels Swann's sickness, it almost revolves uniquely around it; we see none of that in Gilberte's story, only frustrated, ever-contemplative obsession.",1629489175,"as a clever and sensitive boy, he overthinks, over analyses every little insignificant fluctuation occurring throughout their rather mundane and ordinary relationship; he is thus unable to proceed correctly the overwhelming load of information invading his naive mind, too young and unaware of love to respond correctly to the chaos he creates – add to this already complicated situation his introvert nature – his mechanical defense reaction is pure paralysis; trapped alone within his inner turmoil.","young and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"young and unaware","young",NA,NA,0

I falsely believe that if we just fixed our r communication and worked on our sex life, we’d be OK.

She seems to find it catchy, and she maybe sees how it makes people feel like they owe her something, like it makes them defensive.

She seems like she doesn't care about the truth. She cares about what serves her in the moment. She comes across as one of the most despicable housewives. I say ""comes across"" because I don't know this woman. I just see her behavior on TV, Insta, whatever, but I don't know her.

But if you entertain the idea that her behavior has no integrity, it makes more sense, like just because Christian Bale played Batman in a movie doesn't mean he solves crimes or whatever. For me, the only way I can make sense of her behavior is to see her as someone who has no moral center.

"h8xzxy5","This is only your assertion, we are both on an equal footing here, and your words do not prove your assertion that Schneisel and Kaguya will discuss the treaty made between Ohgi and Schneizel. The fact that you believe that Kaguya recognizes the treaty as official does not prove anything.  
What role could Diethard take? We know the role of both Diethard and Ohgi, and Diethard never aspired to take Ohgi's place as Deputy Zero. Avalon never had the hadron cannons: https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/Avalon . They didn't lose, they called a truce, after which some of them escaped.   
If you revisit episode 9, you can see that after Kawaguchi almost every day BK fought, and also in several episodes either Lelouch calls Ohgi or Ohgi calls Zero, which shows that Lelouch was tracking almost all of BK's activities. Yes, he had managers, but all of their wins were only thanks to Zero.  
1. Your statement was based on the fact that the main reason for distrusting Suzak was the death of Nunnally, not ""betrayal during 17."" That is exactly the problem.   
3. You originally claimed that the UFN was created for something similar to ZR.   
4. You stated exactly that: ""He could predict that Schneizel was lying and got on his good graces so that he would be spared.""  
5. The BKs were there just in case, nothing more.  
6. Erasing Euphy's evil legacy was one of the goals for ZR, you can see that in move 22. ZR did not arise after Rolo's death, Rolo's death and Nunnally's ""death"" caused him to go directly against the emperor, with his eventual death, without a plan for ZR.  
8. In essence, it was already a pact. And the fact that Kaguya flew there only to turn the demand into a treaty is your fiction, as Schneizel may well have kept this information until he found the most profitable moment, thereby destroying the UFN's trust in BK.   
9. You claimed that he knew about the team and had Kallen kill Suzaku despite the team. But if he was oblivious and unaware of its effectiveness, you can't claim that Fleija is Lelouch's fault. Yes, Lelouch was always impulsive.   
10. Revisit episodes 18-24, where you can see that Ohgi as Zero's deputy is useless, because without Zero they have no good leadership, no concrete plan of action, and not enough of a commander to lead them.  
11. Despite the fact that it has been claimed that Japan was neutral (which Lelouch did by liberating the colonies, as stated at the beginning of turn 22), the British civilian population has not been expelled or somehow harmed, besides in turn 23 we see how quickly Japan has been reoccupied: ""*In short, the only force Lelouch can deploy against us is the division he brought to reoccupy Japan. But the balance of power can be tipped for him at any time. To minimize damage, we cannot hesitate. The time to confront him is now.""* Which confirms that Britannia was essentially in control of Japan, despite claiming ""neutrality. No matter how much you claim this is not a betrayal of the UFN, you provide no evidence to the contrary, increasingly proving that Ohgi and BK betrayed the UFN.   
12. You yourself have stated that these are equally possible options, and your phrase ""logic"" proves nothing. You can't prove that Schneizel won't tell what he made a deal with Ohgi to betray Zero in exchange for Japan, and since Schneizel is a politician, he's smart enough to keep that information for a long time.   
And there's even more speculation. Whether or not Suzaku would have returned to Japan after the conquests is just your speculation. Ko1 CAN control the chosen zone, but he can also REFUSE, devoting himself entirely to protecting the Emperor and carrying out the Ragnarok plan, which is what Bismarck did.

"h8qqmwy","Our system has the issue some other systems have: we were all very individual throughout our life, but we were all told we were the same person. So while we may have been distinctly different when fronting, ourselves and everyone around us thought it was normal. Thus, working to recognize our differences when switching or ""feeling weird"" has been very very difficult. 

One of these difficulties came from age regressing and meeting our little/slider. For the past threeish years I've been age regressing as a comfort mechanism, and my age regressing began before we realized we were a system. For a few days several weeks after recognizing our systemhood (at first it was only Creature and I who were aware of our individuality. As a note I'll be using vo/vo's pronouns for Creature) Creature would communicate with me and comment to our partner that vo thought there was someone else in the system. Vo didn't know who it was, what their name was, what their personality was, what they looked like, and couldn't contact them. I had no ""feeling"" of a third person and never noticed anything so I thought vo might be thinking wishfully or might be paranoid. 

About a week into Creature noticing this ""third onlooker"" we were with my partner and I age regressed due to something stressful. It calmed me down and I, unbeknownst at the time, became mushy and co-con with our little, Mono. After some time I faded away and Mono was alone in front, Creature and I had no contact with him. 

Our partner started to pick up on it, and Mono did a little too because he thought he was me and was paranoid that he ""wasn't acting right"" (he didn't want our partner to think we were faking by not acting normal). He was hyperactive, somewhat aggressive, and unaware of how to be gentle/give space. It made our partner uncomfortable and eventually they addressed him and asked if he was me. He began to realize he wasn't and there was some time of confusion and turmoil on his end. Eventually he got overwhelmed and I got thrust back to the front. My partner and I talked, and then eventually we started to think.

At first I was mad because he made my partner uncomfortable but I quickly got over it as I learned more about systemhood and littles and him. Now we're really close friends, he calls me big brother :) I was also a little worried or mad that he had taken being little away from me, I *love* age regressing! And I thought that now that I had a distinct little alter every time I tried to age regress it would end up being him fronting. I was also a little paranoid that maybe I didn't actually like it very much and instead it was his feelings bleeding into mine. We had a rough first week, but everything got better eventually. 

For a while before meeting Mono we thought Creature age regressed too, I mean it made sense, it was only vo and I so we thought it would be pretty likely for us to both age regress. Since we met Mono however Creature hasn't age regressed, and it's been a few months, and normally vo age regressed maybe once every one to two weeks. We still aren't certain, it is likely vo just hasn't needed to age regress recently, as vo really enjoyed it, but we aren't certain on anything and honestly don't mind not knowing. 

So, in conclusion/TLDR: Our system was used to being blended and unaware of one another, this caused problems for myself (age regression is a huge coping strat of mine) and our little. We thought it was just me age regressing at first but it's more likely whenever I age regressed we were actually co-con. We realized he's a headmate because he acted different around our partner and made them uncomfortable enough for them to question wether or not he was me. One thing especially that helped us recognize this was that my age is usually in the 1-5 range when I go little whereas his is in the 5-11 range, so sometimes ""I"" would go little but feel older and didn't know why. Turns out it was probably just him XD We are now both very close, no grudges or anger, he and my partner get along super well and love each other very much :) and I still age regress! He didn't actually take it from me, it might be easier for us since our age ranges have very little overlap, which helps us identify ourselves from one another!",1628826047,"he was hyperactive, somewhat aggressive, and unaware of how to be gentle/give space.","aggressive, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"somewhat aggressive , and unaware","aggressive",NA,"somewhat",0

"h8fspdw","Can someone help me answer this question because I'm confused. 

Most recent data shows increase in breakout infection of those that are vaccinated, we now know that we can get infected with Delta even after we are fully vaccinated and we can also infect others around us, which prompted the CDC reaction to start getting the mask ideas re-introduced back into the conversation. No wonder after all the promises of vaccines bringing back normal we are all pissed and disappointed with where we are at this point. 

With that in mind the best reason to still get the vaccine is the wide increase in protection against serious illness or hospitalization. It really is the main benefit and its selfish in nature so it could convince even more people to get the jab. Great lets focus on that. We should all try to do our part in lowering the death rates and keeping most people out of hospital setting and I understand the focus of government in doing so. The vaccine rates will naturally slowly increase with selfish motive of self preservation and if you like to speed this up then continue the positive campaign or even offer some monetary incentives like the one time reward or the lotteries in different provinces. IT IS WORKING. 

Now my question is where does the Vaccine Passport fit into that. If we know that you can still infect people while fully vaccinated and you can be asymptomatic and unaware of even being infected, then putting people in crowded, indoor places, just because they are vaccinated and have passports DOES NOTHING in protecting people from infections. It could actually be counter productive and give people false sense of security to go out and put themselves and others at more risk just because they now can and therefore contribute to even more outbreaks and limitations in the future. It seems to me from previous experience that the cases of infections numbers were always used to bring in the most restrictions but with the very successful vaccination campaign Canada should be able to avoid major hospitalization and death numbers even with infection spikes from Delta variant in the near future. Unfortunately the spikes will happen and it could be larger with the implementation of Vaccines Passports therefore brining in more limitations and frustration in the future, making us all feel again like this will never end. 

It seems to me that Vaccines Passports are more negative then positive when it comes to this pandemic. I understand the carrot over stick incentives to get most people vaccinated but it seems to me again more of a political stunt then actual pandemic control measure. Add to that the polarization of the society that it causes with division between those that are and are not vaccinated. Add the chance of actually infecting more people with the false sense of security and the historical concerns people have with privacy issues, over reach of government when given a chance and it all looks to me like a really bad idea and not an overall benefit. 

Does anyone else feel the same way or sees things a different way.

Of course, now we have all heard about the opioid crisis and doctors are hardly prescribing them anymore, so people can be more knowledgable going in to surgeries and illness and have a plan with their health team so they don't become another statistic. 

But yeah, the withdrawal is crazy. When I'd go through it, I wanted to kill myself and I mean that very seriously, but I just didn't have the energy to do it. I thought, if I could have walked myself to a bridge I'd just jump off. I'd lay there on the floor, crying. I'd frantically check the apartment to see if there were any more pills. I'd be profusely sweating, running to the bathroom, having fever episodes and so on. And I'd tell myself I'd never do it again.

One time, I was so afraid of the withdrawal that I googled for a drug dealer in my area, I emailed him - knowing it could be an axe murderer or a cop - and he wanted to meet in a graveyard two hours away. When I showed up, he actually yelled at me, saying how crazy it was for a tiny young girl to be doing this. He gave me my pills though. And he was actually very nice! But THAT is how crazy drug addiction is, that I would risk my life like that. 

As for your alcohol issues, I hope you get that sorted because while alcohol will kill you and rob you of everything you care about more slowly, it still ends up with the same result. And you deserve to be joyous, happy and free! Reach out for help if you need it.

Why would they be unprepared or unaware. The King (Varys) would have spies all over Essos and many lords conduct trade with the Free Cities. Surely they would be aware that a large horde of horselords had come to town and were asking about ships.

All of them from the Century of Blood. We haven't heard of them being destroyed recently which would make sense if my theory is true and the Dothraki have regressed since the Century of Blood.

Also my problem with Sarnor and how they were destroyed is that for the most part they do seem to have stone walls, so how did the Dothraki get inside.

Genitals are a sign of ones sex, not gender, and even that isn’t always binary. Thats why we dont present birth certificates when using the bathroom. Sex and gender are not the same. Sex is your physical anatomy, gender is a mix of your psychology and cultural roles.

"h7prhry","&gt;So at first you started arguing that the numbers are wrong, then you go into the idea that redlining, population density, etc leads to crime.

I never changed the argument. The numbers are correct for the data sources used. The data sources are significantly flawed. If you still don't understand that then this conversation is over because I have provided mountains of evidence showing you exactly that.

Redlining, etc, is illustrating another nuance. Another *contributing factor* to a broad and complicated issue that you seem only able to selectively curate through a racist lense.

&gt;You act like it’s mind blowing that more African Americans are getting accused of crime, then you defend that they actually might be committing more crime by saying other factors like population density play in.

**It can be both**. Multiple things contribute to the issue. I understand that needing to read and consider a bit more than a confirmation bias is difficult, but if you want to have your opinion taken seriously you'll need to do less repeating of racist dogwhistles and more actual analysis.

&gt;It has nothing to do with racism

[It literally has a page on the Anti Defamation League.](https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/1352-1390) You responded to a general statement about police being largely unconstitutional on an institutional basis with a very specific racist dogwhistle. Either you are ignorant and unaware of the sort of messaging you are repeating, or you think others like me are too ignorant to recognize it.

&gt;They’re not dumb enough to give the data about who is doing the crime, that would be racist.

You've got the racism in this thread covered well enough. Otherwise, what is the contextual value of your response? In what possible way is the 13/50 stat even **possibly** relevant to my well-supported claim about the unlawful behavior of police in the USA?

&gt;It’s gang violence.

So you are going to point to organized crime, committing crimes, against other criminal organizations? And then amplify that to mean that all black people are criminal? You really don't have a head for nuance or critical thinking.

Imagine if I pointed out to the most criminal parts of the Mafia's past. Oh, look, those white people are *so violent* and criminal.

Or, heck, look back from the 50s-90s. What skin color was al Capone? Most Mafiosos? How many bodies were being left in the streets? Oh, right, these are issues of organied crime, in major population centers with extreme population densities. But nah, lets forget nuance. The Mafia and Al Capone are proof positive that white people are all violent.

And a few hotspots in Mexico where there is gang activity? Yeah. All the mexicans are violent too.

Well golly gee, by your criteria every race everywhere is violent. 

Are you starting to understand how insultingly pathetic your argument is?

&gt; But In The current state of society, they do commit more crime

I thougt you just said that it wasn't african american people, but established criminal organizations working in major cities?

Also, **none** of this has anything to do with my claim. I provided mountains of evidence from an objective source, the DOJ, that shows every single time an LEA in the USA has been investigated it has been found to be violating constitutional rights of citizens in regular, systemic, pattern. LEAs are statistically far more likely to be an organized criminal organization than some random black neighborhood, since there are plenty of black neighborhoods that don't have gang/crime problems, but we have yet to take a close look at an LEA and find they *actually obey the law*. 

This has been a nice racist distraction, but the point stands. Police in the USA have been found to be criminals every single time they have been examined.",1628105735,"either you are ignorant and unaware of the sort of messaging you are repeating, or you think others like me are too ignorant to recognize it.  &gt;they’re not dumb enough to give the data about who is doing the crime, that would be racist.","ignorant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"ignorant and unaware","ignorant",NA,NA,0

"h7cwzcg","Honestly? Getting a 70+ is definitely achievable but probably not in the way you think.

My section 2 score went from 62, to 73, to an 80 over the couple times I sat the GAMSAT, and I can definitely say the quality of my writing didn’t get better between the sittings (in terms of vocabulary, word count, structure, flow etc). I’ve always been more of a maths/science problem based thinker and not great at writing essays in general, I always thought that when I compared my essays to others I used a lot more simpler writing and definitely wouldn’t call it professional sounding in any sense.

What I DID change however was the style of arguments and the kind of thinking I was presenting in my section 2 writing. When I got the 73 and the 80, those were the times I reeaallly thought outside the box, and wrote essays I thought the markers wouldn’t be expecting, and basically took the pathway that most students in the GAMSAT wouldn’t have thought of. The Gamsat markers are definitely looking for fresh ideas and uncommon opinions that set you apart from the thousands of other essays the majority of students write, and that’s who they give those high marks to.

My best marks were from years where I not only had a solid background knowledge of the topic, but was able to present a completely different perspective from the mainstream. It helps if you’re passionate about certain topics, and often you can twist the essay towards something you’re familiar with and can write a solid argument on. 

So, how can you put this into practice? Do as much reading as you can, and make sure you’re up to date with a huge variety of topics, current events, political opinions etc etc.
I don’t mean just reading a lot of academic books, you need to be gathering info from all sorts of sources like news articles, Ted talks, Facebook and Instagram posts (yes I’m serious), documentaries. I would make sure to read from both very conservative/right wing media outlets as well as left wing/liberal media and news to obtain both perspectives on a bunch of topics (economics, social justice, climate change etc). 
I even spend time going through the hellhole that is the Facebook comments of posts from news stations, as you really get a whole bunch of public opinions both positive and negative, and it helped me make my own objective opinion and possibly think of a new angle that hadn’t been voiced yet.

I’ll just give you a quick example for comparison of my section 2 essays to explain it a bit better:

S2 mark: 63
The topic/essay prompts were heavily based on the environment/climate change/population control.
I wrote what I thought was a solid essay, gave some good opinions on climate change and global warming, basically took the perspective of “climate change = bad” and we need to fix it. It wasn’t a bad essay at all but I can guarantee it was exactly the same as 1000 others and it wasn’t really a stretch of the imagination at all.

S2 mark: 80
The topic/essay prompts (I can’t remember fully) but they were geared towards “teenagers aren’t ready for adulthood”, “kids today aren’t prepared for the real world and need to grow up” (there were more quotes I just can’t really remember sorry)
What I wrote: I presented an argument which basically said it’s an extreme privilege to be a kid/teenager who “isn’t prepared for the real world” or to grow up unprepared for adulthood, as millions of kids are faced with very adult realities from an early age. I gave examples of the police brutality faced by black people in the USA, and the fact that children are forced to grow up and come to terms with racism from a young age in order to survive (ie Tamir rice who was killed at age 14), and so black children don’t have the privilege of “being unprepared for adulthood” because being unprepared and unaware of systemic issues that affect them could likely result in death. Similarly, women start to experience sexual harassment and sexual assault from as young as 11 or 12, and young girls are forced to mature early in order to navigate the world safely and manage what most people would see as “grown up issues” or adult problems. So yeah basically the whole premise of my essay was around privilege and how children of minority groups don’t have the luxury of growing up unprepared for adult life.

Comparing the 63 essay to the 80 essay, what got me that high mark would have definitely been the more out of the box thinking, and the fact that I took a completely different angle to what the markers were expecting. I can’t speak for everyone but for the second one, I can guess that the essay markers read hundreds of essays  on how teenagers aren’t prepared for adult life because we don’t get taught how to do taxes in school or some shit (which isn’t a bad argument at all, it’s just probably more common and not really stretching the imagination by any means)

Anyway basically as I said above, I wouldn’t have been able to write complex opinions and ‘out of the box’ ideas if I hadn’t done a shit tonne of reading and gained a solid background knowledge on current world issues, and the differing opinions on them.

I know this isn’t probably the advice you were expecting or hoping for, as most people when offering tips for section 2 basically tell you to go read a dictionary and use big words to sound more professional, but in my honest opinion it doesn’t matter how many practice essays you write and how fancy your vocabulary is, if your ideas are trash and you don’t really know what you’re writing about in the first place you won’t crack that 70.",1627853772,"i gave examples of the police brutality faced by black people in the usa, and the fact that children are forced to grow up and come to terms with racism from a young age in order to survive (ie tamir rice who was killed at age 14), and so black children don’t have the privilege of “being unprepared for adulthood” because being unprepared and unaware of systemic issues that affect them could likely result in death.","unprepared and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"unprepared and unaware","unprepared",NA,NA,0

"h7aetfr","Im not an atheist, but i dont know in what i believe in particular (i was raised as a catholic tho).

More or less a month ago, my mother and I almost died in a fire. 
Lights had gone out, we went to bed. She took a candle (inside an old plastic cup) to read for a while, but fell asleep with it still lit.

Long story short, she felt ""someone"" waking her up, and when she opened her eyes she saw a huge flame, coming from the charred remains of the cup, made of the lit candlewas and book she was reading, black smoke everywhere.
She sindlehandlely took care of everything and saved us both.

But the important part (to answer your mortality crisis) is that I was completely asleep. Like a rock. I normally dream a lot but that day I didnt remember any dreaming being done: just the blackness of my closed eyelids. 

When she told me all this the next day, and realized we could have died, I noticed I wouldnt have known, had I still been asleep st the moment of my death. I would have died in my sleep. And i noticed I felt nothing back then, I was asleep and unaware of the house almost burning down.

"h75sucy","&gt; Marx was never anti-semitic, I just proved that

No you didn't.

I literally quoted him making antisemitic remarks, and your claim that he was ""ethnically Jewish"" and therefore magically cannot be antisemitic is farcical. That's not how logic works. People can be (and often are) bigoted against groups they are close to.

He didn't consider himself to be Jewish.

Indeed, the argument that he was ""ethnically Jewish"" is something typically seen in deeply racist groups, like antisemites and the ethnoreligious apartheid state of Israel (which, notably, also didn't exist at the time, so is doubly irrelevant).

Whether or not someone else considered him to be Jewish has zero bearing on him being antisemitic.

And heck, you can be racist or bigoted against a group you are a member of. Plenty of people are.

Marx didn't believe in god. That means he was an atheist. That's what the word ""atheist"" means - someone who does not believe in any sort of god. He wasn't a part of any atheistic organization or anything, but being an atheist has nothing to do with organized religion or organizations. There are many flavors of atheist in the world, many of whom use other terms to more specifically desribe themselves.

Because he was a pseudointellectual narcissist, he liked to prove how smart he was, and thus constantly proved how stupid he was, like most people who are incompetent and unaware of it. His ranting about atheism proved he didn't actually understand atheists at all, as he believed that atheism was a ""refutation"" of god, which is not what atheism is.

&gt; Marx also didn't call himself a ""Marxist"", so for you to say he had an ""ideology"" (despite criticizing the very notion of ideology itself) reveals quite a gap in your knowledge on these topics

"h72rhim","I remember binge reading UQ Holder with the bare essential knowledge of Negima and I can tell you for a fact that it’s not worth it.

The plot flip-flops constantly with power scaling so flawed, it makes something like GoH or DB look normal. The story continuously throws curveballs at you despite not knowing what the hell it’s trying to accomplish and by the time the author finally decides on a proper objective, the manga’s already 100+ in. Add on the fact that the pace goes at mach 20 and you’re guaranteed to be confused and unaware of anything that’s going on.

The characters are as cookie-cutter as they get for your typical battle shounen manga and while I wholly appreciate that the manga is nowhere near as terrible as its anime counterpart, it isn’t really worth talking about.

Negima was an exception with the idea that the genre makes a total U-turn and heads for something that had never been seen in other manga/anime of its time. This isn’t applicant to UQ Holder, though, as the author seems to really like the direction he was headed towards the end of Negima.

One plus is that if you like good fights with a somewhat loose hold of plot armor for the main cast, then this series delivers. All the characters are immortal (not a spoiler since that’s the whole gimmick of this sequel) so you’ll get a good fill of brutal/gory panels within most of the chapters.

"h6wsgtz","I think there’s a way to fight for that world that’s more honest than just pretending it’s here though. Or worse, acting entitled to have other people act like it’s here.

I guess it’s really nuanced, which gets lost in a Reddit discussion. There’s a difference between simply showing skin and wearing clothes that to a majority of the population are highly sexual. There’s a difference between expecting not to be harassed (which every woman has the right not to be, regardless of what she’s wearing) and expecting not to be noticed and seen a certain way.

I’m not saying crop tops and dildos are equivalent; I’m just pointing out that you can’t desexualize something just by saying it’s not sexual. I’m sure some crop tops in some stylings actually don’t look sexual. I’m only talking about what’s obviously a sexualized look even if you don’t want it to be one.

I’m not saying what’s next either. I’m not worried about some kind of degeneracy. As I said, I was in the kink scene, I love women expressing their sexuality! I’m not telling anyone not to do that. It’s just disingenuous if you know something is a sexual look and then you get mad when people see you that way.

I guess our difference is that I fundamentally see self-expression as a relational thing. Everyone is entitled to be free from harassment, but no one is entitled to be free from the perceptions of other people and the context of society. We don’t live in a void. When you choose what to wear to the grocery store and much more so what to wear in an Instagram video, you may be choosing what you like but you are also choosing how you want others to perceive you. And you don’t get to define the world’s perceptions.

How do we change those? I don’t know. I genuinely don’t believe it’s just by acting out old male fantasies but claiming we’re doing it for ourselves now, so that we can both get attention and be outraged by it. That seems far too convenient, a way to pretend things are changing when everything is really the same…

"h6nvgkx","If the label really bothers you, give him some time. My husband is bi but only realized it and came out after he met me. Fifteen years later, I transition, and he gets to kind of explore that side of himself. But unlike me, he's never been in the queer community before, and it's been a bit of an experience for him. He can get embarrassed to say it and he doesn't know how people will react. Obviously this is still exciting for him because he's bi so he's more inclined to push through embarrassment, but your partner may become more comfortable with the label over time.

That said, I don't know, this is really hard. I've gone through periods with more or less interest in him (obviously, we've been together over fifteen years lol, that's a whole chunk of time to be with one person.) Personally though, my interest in my husband has never been higher. I'm so much happier being able to be an out queer man, I love that people see us that way even with our kids in tow, I am way more interested in sex than I ever have been, and having his support has made me more keen to be with him. I'm not a particularly... Dependent or romantic person either. There have been many times I've wondered why he even stays with me because I'm a inclined to be a independent, moody, distant, asshole. 😂 But I think... I don't know, man. Like.

"h6hgqxq","Firstly, let's clear up some misconceptions. The data doesn't show that Delta is any more serious to kids compared to the Wuhan strain. In fact, the UK has not reported a single death among adolescents under the age of 20 since May 1st, even in spite of them letting Delta run rampant within their population for the past 3 months. Furthermore, they aren't vaccinating 12-18 year olds yet, so the vast majority of their adolescents are unvaccinated to this day. We see this trend in Singapore too, where only a small minority (49 out 1142 in the past 14 days) of our infections are among those under 18, and every one is mild or asymptomatic.

Also, an increase in unlinked cases does mean that ring-fencing becomes less effective, but do we really need such measures within a highly vaccinated population? The reason unlinked cases have risen is because our population is so highly vaccinated today. It's well documented that a breakthrough infection would almost certainly be asymptomatic, and therefore the carriers would be completely unaffected and unaware of the virus. As a result, several generations of silent transmission between vaccinated people can occur before a symptomatic case is tested. By the time contact tracers try to find the links, those in the chain could have recovered fully and never be uncovered. Our vaccination programme is still accelerating, and as more needles get put into arms, we can only expect the proportion of asymptomatic transmissions to rise. Trying to lock down these untraceable infections will be a futile and meaningless effort especially since these cases wouldn't even need medical attention, let alone a hospital or ICU bed.

We will see an increase in infections as we reopen. We will see an increase in unlinked cases as we get more vaccinated and our cases become mostly asymptomatic. We will not return to the unsustainable stage of single digit daily case counts as the virus becomes endemic within our community. However, this virus has been tamed by widespread vaccination, and it doesn't pose a threat to our medical system and society as a whole. The longer our government and our community takes to accept this reality, the more we are handicapping ourselves in the post-pandemic recovery.",1627228708,"it's well documented that a breakthrough infection would almost certainly be asymptomatic, and therefore the carriers would be completely unaffected and unaware of the virus.","unaffected and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely unaffected and unaware","unaffected",NA,"completely",0

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Hindu intellectual class is rising and that’s why they actually hate Arnab. He’s not only doing a better job than them at their own game, but undermining their entire life’s work and value system that was unjustly and coercively applied to a preoccupied and naive people. They are now paying the price for this betrayal, and their dying pangs gives me immense pleasure.

I'm so late on this thread, but I had to jump into say that this was such a fantastic script. I was so invested in the characters, and then the boldness of the end-- kudos to you. Just so amazing. As a viewer coming in, I wouldn't be able to stop talking about this show. 

You've already got great feedback and have mentioned some changes you plan; I just want to say, the main thing that bothered me was Tabitha's character. For me, she feels much younger than a 15 year old about to become a woman. She sounds like an 11 or 12 year old, still asking questions rather than demanding answers, not resorting to typical ""I'll find out on my own"" older teen tactics, and until she leaves in the evening, doesn't seem to have that self-confidence/I know everything attitude that teens get. I actually went back and checked how old she is while reading, because I was so confused about how old she's supposed to be.

That's all subjective, just my experience, and I know she's meant to be naive and unaware of how things work, but I'd like to see her pushed more one way or the other: very meek, quiet, not yet prepared to step into the world of adults; or more rebellious, aware of her power and position, entitled despite all she doesn't know. 

That one quibble aside, this was a banger of a script. Such a great world, so many breadcrumbs to follow in later episodes, a mysterious betrayal-- even the way the magic works feels unique.

"h649rjh","This is not likely considering the endemic nature of the virus worldwide. The vast majority of our population is partially vaccinated at least, and more than half will be fully protected by today. It's well documented that vaccinated patients would almost certainly be asymptomatic, and we know that a vaccinated carrier has a reduced, but nonzero chance of spreading the disease. What's likely happening today is that a very large proportion of our infections are asymptomatic and the carriers are completely unaffected and unaware of the virus. When the chain eventually reaches an unvaccinated person who goes to the doctor, the transmission may have gone through several generations of silent transmission. By the time the contact tracers try to link the case back, the carrier could have recovered naturally already, completely unaffected by the infection.

This is a good thing. It means that even if the virus is spreading within our population, almost every case won't even need a doctor visit, let alone a hospital or ICU bed. Through rapid vaccination, we have tamed the virus to a threat comparable to the seasonal flu among the majority who protected themselves. The only caveat is that our unvaccinated seniors are still at risk of this endemic disease.

"h5xlzyo","If they ask for an email, after you JUST EMAILED THEM, it's a scam. It's not identity theft. They use a robot to collect thousands of responses and then compile them, and sell them to spam companies. They pay decent money for a list of *currently active and responsive* email addresses. It's a plus they know you're looking for housing too.

If the pics are irregularly cropped (different sizes and aspect ratios) it means they cropped out a realty watermark. Probably old and not even on the market.

NO ONE is old and unaware of the market. Post an ad for below market value and you're gonna get 50 responses in the first hour. I see a lot of ads go up for a tad under market, contact them, they get in touch and hours later have already edited the ad so it's way more expensive. People know what competitive looks like. Lol but glad you're holding out hope you can pay super low rent due to other's ignorance :/   /s

If they write their email in the ad, it's a scam.

If they put their phone number in the ad, it's probably legit. If it's a local area code, even better. I'm sure they'll exploit this eventually, but right now it's the best way to know.

If the place says dogs OK cats OK but the body of the ad doesn't, probably a scam. They set those to pets ok by default when posting them. They copy and paste descriptions from legit ads, so those usually won't mention pets. One time I saw an ad and the dude who posted it literally forgot to delete the email he must have been forwarded as the end of the scam ad said ""Make sure to mark it as pets ok, dogs ok, private bath, and price $500.""

Also look for local details. ""Short walk to brewery"" is vague and could be scam. ""5 minutes to UC Davis, near the amtrak station in old downtown, I'm a worker at Intel in Sac"" are good hints.

He had the steel-wrapped warriors, honestly the best of their generation, on their plate-maille barded destriers ride at full charge at the orc village. Their armor and swords the finest that money could buy, their experience had been bought in blood and their courage was priceless. But that had been before the smiling old orc had stepped out behind the purple tree. A few words whispered and the tree began to spark like it had been hit by lightning, then the lightning arced forward and his men and their horses fell. The General had never seen anything like it. The men were gone, their armour charred and black, their horses lifeless and from out of the village tents came a chant: Ungumrt! Ungumrt! Ungumrt! The old, toothless orc smiled again as he walked forward, unarmed and yet deadly. Small and frail and yet powerful. The chanting continued and as the small orc continued slowly forward, hobbling towards the General, the orcs of the village started congregating on ridge overlooking the pair. The chanting continued until the old orc reached the mounted commander and raised a single, gnarled finger. ""They were good men."" The general snarled at him, like a cornered dog. ""They are better now. Less killing doing now."" replied the happy orc. ""You go now, there is mourning to be done in your tent. We will let your dead take with you."" The General stared with hatred. The chanting had started again. ""You will regret this!"" he spat angrily. The old orc smiled again. ""You welcome in our village. Bring more clanky men. Ungumrt make more better men for you."" The general pulled his horse away in a curse. And the Orc smiled. In the village, a group of confused orcs stumbled from the tent behind the Ungumrt tree. 10 of them in total, they stood naked and unaware of who or what they were. The 10 of them blinked in the bright daylight and looked around dazed. ""What happened?"" they asked. The old orc beamed at them. ""You better men now.""

It's completely understandable to have anxiety, or to be distrusting, in the world we're in. You don't necessarily have to have an external ""reason"" like abuse to justify being skeptical or even afraid to be around others. But if you ask me, this sentence is very telling:

It's wonderful that they wanted to protect and support you, and they sound like very good people with genuinely good intentions.

You'd likely be surprised how *common* it actually is.

1) A story that makes them feel better about what they do to us.

or 2) Are seduced by the mass of others to partake in these actions.

Mob mentality is real, so when people tell other people stories about each other, or befriend someone to bring into their group that seems nice, and or full of popular people, individuals will convert to those people's way of thinking.

Not to defend that, since personally I think it is important that people learn about the world around them, but I think one reason for that is that it's pretty easy to tell the story of Kosovo to an interested observer in a way that's fairly neutral and makes Britain seem broadly decent. Northern Ireland though? There just seems, from the outside, to be so much disagreement about everything, and everything seems wholly alien.

Certainly if you ask some people to tell you ""so what's the deal with Northern Ireland? You know, in general?"", they'll end up telling you that the British Army are murderers and terrorist attacks are okay sometimes within minutes. So you go to the other side, and they tell that the Earth is six thousand years old, homosexuality is sinful and for some reason it's important to wear orange and talk about King William, and that basically uses up the time a normal person is willing to devote to learning about Northern Ireland. And they walk away more perplexed than before, more convinced than ever that the whole thing is a write-off.

"h5f2bgq","&gt;that systems can be racist in effect without being explicitly racist

This requires you to believe in unconscious bias (as a mistake or error cannot be labelled as racist since racism requires purpose behind it, an act of discrimination) which is an anti-scientific unfalsifiable theory. I cannot believe in something like that and do not believe that people are racist and unaware of it. It sets up a kafkatrap in which we get the absurdities of things like, my protestation of my not being racist means it's white fragility and I'm therefore racist. 

It takes us down a very dark path. I accept there are racists in the world, but unless you can prove it objectively then I'm going to assume they're a good a person and not racist whether intentionally or otherwise.

"h599w44","I am afraid one major flaw with certain segments of academia is the Dunning-Kruger effect - they are incompetent and unaware of it, so believe they are having great thoughts when in fact they are not.

This is a good example, unfortunately. The person you are quoting who was talking about trying to mod the game in this way doesn't understand how video games work.

Paradox Interactive makes grand strategy games based around certain eras and cultures. These mechanics are ill suited to other eras. The hereditary nobility of the feudal era bears little resemblance to modern society as well.

This has nothing to do with ""colonialism"" and everything to do with basic game mechanics. It is not some grand insight but a failure to understand what games are and how they function.

Games have what is known as a scope - something that they are trying to do, some core gameplay loop they are trying to achieve. Trying to make a game function beyond its scope seldom ends well.

The idea of ""a game that can do everything"" is attractive to people who are naive to game design. In reality, such games end up pretty terrible, because the scope creep results in lack of focus and poor game design. People play a particular game for a particular experience, and ignoring this has killed numerous projects.

For instance, Titan was a MMORPG designed by Blizzard to succeed World of Warcraft. The idea behind it was that you were a bunch of superheroes who would do some jobs their secret identity by day and then go be superheroes at night.

However, the bimodal gameplay made playing the game miserable because the half of the game that wasn't your preferred thing was busywork and you couldn't just focus on one thing to the exclusion of the other. It also just ended up being not all that fun.

The project was canned and never released while a few superhero ideas got recycled into Overwatch, a much better and more focused game.

The same applies here. Trying to depict tribal societies is probably a project unto itself that would not jive well with other sorts of gameplay. You would want to dedicate a game design to it, and it would probably not really resemble ""grand strategy"" games.

There are additional issues as well, the largest being that the people who are talking about this would be absolutely enraged by a realistic depiction of tribal societies.

For example, researchers have found that such societies were often extremely violent - 10-50% of men died violent deaths, and things like raiding nearby tribes for people and resources was common.

On top of this, tribal societies fell before more advanced civilizations for a reason, and a ""realistic"" depiction of tribal society's potential long-term development would likely push players in the same direction of becoming more sedentary and generating more food and building settlements and cities supported by more advanced and efficient agricultural technologies to maximize their tribe's potential, as that is how you ""win"" as a society (""winning"" here being able to support a large population with dominance over your surroundings which make you much less vulnerable to raids).

Even if there is no explicit  ""win"" condition, many players would likely push this way if allowed to - and while playing out the neolithic agricultural revolution would be cool in a sense, it would probably not make people really happy who want this, especially indigenous Australians.

Indeed, a lot of this stuff would be very upsetting - which is one major reason why so few games attempt to depict such societies in the first place.

Do it accurately, people get upset, and some people would likely see it as evidence of racist animus against people in tribal societies.

Do it inaccurately, people decry your lack of research and revisionist history.

Indeed, realism is often not even desirable from a gameplay perspective - what is realistic and what is fun and engaging are often not the same thing.",1626342214,"i am afraid one major flaw with certain segments of academia is the dunning-kruger effect - they are incompetent and unaware of it, so believe they are having great thoughts when in fact they are not.","incompetent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"incompetent and unaware","incompetent",NA,NA,0

"h4yw2rz","So is he no longer seeing your daughter? Or forfeiting regular contact in favour of a different arrangement?

I can kinda emphasize but with less drama. My sons(9) dad got into a new relationship 3 years ago, they live an hour away with her two kids. He went from seeing my son once a week to sporadically every few months for maybe 2 nights maximum. She clearly has issues with my son. 

As much as I know you'll want to explain and tell your daughter it all, I wouldn't. My son is 9 and as far as he is aware his dad loves him loads, they have a good time when they see each other and there is no bad blood between me and him.

This isn't because I think the way he is treated is okay, but because he is young and I just want him to be blissfully happy and unaware of adult issues. I want him to enjoy his childhood with as little worries or insecurities as possible.

"h4yefdy","The 190 passengers of American Airlines’ Flight 1774 boarded the plane last week in an orderly manner and took their seats for an approximately two-hour ride from Dallas-Fort Worth to Charlotte.

Elizabeth LaClair was sitting in Row 2 when she heard a woman sitting behind her say to the man next to her that she did not want the plane “to fly up anymore,” becoming increasingly unsettled.

“She just seemed off and very odd,” said LaClair, who was flying back home to Augusta, Ga., after hiking in Utah.

“She started getting more and more agitated and very loud, and the man sitting next to her, along with the flight attendants, kindly tried to console her and calm her, but nothing worked,” LaClair added.

Suddenly, the woman who appeared to be in her 30s and had green hair, ran to the door and tried to open it, LaClair said.

Flight attendants ran and “tackled” the woman, then restrained her wrists and feet with duct tape and what appeared to be zip ties, LaClair added.

“It was the look of pure shock of someone who has been a flight attendant for many years and is thinking, I can’t believe this is happening,” she said.

After being partially restrained in a crew area, LaClair said, the woman seemed to become more erratic and violent by the minute, kicking and screaming expletives, causing “a ruckus.”

That is when the flight attendants asked passengers in the rows ahead of and behind the woman to stand up so employees could subdue her and duct-tape her to the seat.

American Airlines confirmed the incident in a statement sent to The Washington Post on Sunday, saying that as the commotion developed, the crew reported a “potential security concern” after the woman tried to open a boarding door and “physically assaulted and bit a flight attendant.”

“The individual was restrained until the flight landed at CLT [Charlotte] and could be met by law enforcement and emergency personnel,” the statement said. “We applaud our crew for their professionalism and quick effort to protect those on board.”

The pilot told passengers to stay in their seats and said there was “a problem in the plane,” but did not offer further details, leaving other passengers in the back of the plane confused and unaware of what was happening.

A spokesperson for American Airlines did not respond to further questions about the episode, including whether the company’s policy allows the use of duct tape to restrain passengers who endanger others, but the spokesperson said the woman will be barred from its flights pending further investigation.

The Federal Aviation Administration has reported a recent increase in the number of reports of unruly behavior on flights. In May, the agency said it was reviewing 1,300 reports of passengers behaving badly on flights since February — after initiating 1,300 such cases in the decade prior.

1,300 travelers have been reported for ‘unruly behavior’ on flights since February, FAA says

In May, a 28-year-old woman on a Southwest Airline flight was accused of attacking a flight attendant after she ignored instructions as the plane landed in San Diego. She was arrested after allegedly giving the crew member serious bodily injuries, including the loss of two teeth.

“This unprecedented number of incidents has reached an intolerable level, with passenger non-compliance events also becoming more aggressive in nature,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of Transport Workers Union Local 556 in a letter to Southwest Airlines CEO.

The plane from last week’s incident landed about 3:20 a.m. on Wednesday at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, where police and emergency personnel boarded the aircraft “to provide treatment and transport the customer to a local hospital for evaluation,” American Airlines said.

A video posted on TikTok showed the woman wearing a purple shirt, strapped to her seat with silver duct tape over her mouth and around her arms and chest, screaming what sounds like “You! You! You!” as passengers exited the aircraft past her and flight attendants calmly saw people off.

Even after being fully restrained, the woman continued to yell obscenities throughout the flight, LeClair said.

“All we wanted was for the flight to land, which felt like an eternity,” LaClair said, praising the flight crew for its quick response and for keeping the passengers safe in a volatile situation.

He had the steel-wrapped warriors, honestly the best of their generation, on their plate-maille barded destriers ride at full charge at the orc village. Their armour and swords the finest that money could buy, their experience had been bought in blood and their courage was priceless. But that had been before the smiling old orc had stepped out behind the purple tree. A few words whispered and the tree began to spark like it had been hit by lightning, then the lightning arced forward and his men and their horses fell. The General had never seen anything like it. The men were gone, their armour charred and black, their horses lifeless and from out of the village tents came a chant: Ungumrt! Ungumrt! Ungumrt! The old, toothless orc smiled again as he walked forward, unarmed and yet deadly. Small and frail and yet powerful. The chanting continued and as the small orc continued slowly forward, hobbling towards the General, the orcs of the village started congregating on ridge overlooking the pair. The chanting continued until the old orc reached the mounted commander and raised a single, gnarled finger. ""They were good men."" The general snarled at him, like a cornered dog. ""They are better now. Less killing doing now."" replied the happy orc. ""You go now, there is mourning to be done in your tent. We will let your dead take with you."" The General stared with hatred. The chanting had started again. ""You will regret this!"" he spat angrily. The old orc smiled again. ""You welcome in our village. Bring more clanky men. Ungumrt make more better men for you."" The general pulled his horse away in a curse. And the Orc smiled. In the village, a group of confused orcs stumbled from the tent behind the Ungumrt tree. 10 of them in total, they stood naked and unaware of who or what they were. The 10 of them blinked in the bright daylight and looked around dazed. ""What happened?"" they asked. The old orc beamed at them. ""You better men now.""

However Honey THINKS she knows everything. Not in a bad way, but when someone has a limited view of the world, they are able to familiarize with it well and there comes a point they think they know everything and are a master because they don’t have any idea a bigger world exists.

In The Who’s a good therapist episode, Honey literally talks to the other dogs about how they chose to be together, unlike her and chief, and that’s when we find out that Honey is under the impression that because Chief and her are the only dogs in the house, that that is all her life is ever going to be. Honey does not see past the walls of the house.

So when she finds out that some dogs “chose” to be together it’s prying open her small mind, also when she sees the coyote, and when she meets the Big Cookie lookalike at the beach who says she lives the van life.

Honeys entire character is one that is originally shown to know everything and has it under control, but she is one of the most insecure and unaware of what’s ACTUALLY happening.

"h4jos63","It sounds like word substitution/replacement because of the aphasia related to her dementia. It's also a common feature for people with Primary Progressive Aphasia. 

Stress and frustration can make word retrieval more difficult and if she feels rushed or intimidated by staff she might feel that if she doesn't speak fast enough then her needs won't be met. Remind staff to give her enough time to take in the information and form a response. I recall one resident always substituted the word ""papers"" because it related to something she often said when she worked a secretary in her younger years. 

It's definitely a dignity issue because it sounds like they are mocking her. It's sad because having Alzheimer's doesn't mean she can't pick up on things like tone or attitude. Glad that you are trying to step on those things. I can almost picture the staff laughing while asking her those questions to try and get a rise out of each other. She might not get what they are trying to do, but she probably picks up on the fact that they are basically laughing at her.

"h4jcvet","I work at a vet and hopefully can answer your questions. Know that every vet handles things differently. 

First of all, you absolutely DO NOT have to be present. Ignore the ignorant comments that say you have to be. You don't. No one will think less of you. If you do not want to watch, ask your vet to sedate your pet first (some do this as a standard but make sure) this way your pet will be asleep and unaware of what's going on, or whether you are there or not. 

This is a deeply personal choice. Your pet will not die alone. The vet assistant or tech will be there to help the doctor. I've aided a few euths myself when owners do not wish to be present and can assure you they are loved on just as much by us as their owner. 

If you like to be present, that's fine as well! You can ask your dog to be sedated too, so he will be more relaxed when the final injection comes. This might be more beneficial to you. Sometimes veins are hard to find, dogs can get worked up, ect ect so they tend to react less to those things. Every pet is different of course, and your vet might sedate as a standard procedure. 

You will be brought directly into a room (you can call from the parking lot to be sure you can go into a room right away). Clients in the waiting room might stare, which DRIVES ME CRAZY. But the vet staff won't. The vet won't. Once your in a room, they may go over the basics. They'll ask what you want to do with your pet afterwards - either the clinic disposes (if this is not explicitly a cremation services, your pet goes in the dumpster, just an FYI), cremation with or without ashes returned, or you can decide to take your deceased pet home. Taking him home, they'll wrap him in a bag or box and carry him out to your car for you. They'll have you pull around back for that. You are free to spend as much time as you like with your pet, both before and after. When it comes to the final injection, it's a very quick death. Sometimes they will urinate or defecate on themselves afterwards (I haven't personally seen this happen but it can). Sometimes they might gasp for breath, but that's just a reflex reaction. Sometimes they'll take another breath, but again, just a reflex that can happen after death. Sometimes pets cry out (haven't seen this personally but have heard it happening). 

Yes, you will cry. And that's okay. Sometimes the staff will cry with you. Sometimes the vet will shed a tear. My vet cried with me when I euthanized my pets (before I worked there).

My first dog I elected to say goodbye in the room with him. They sedated him and I asked them to do the final injection away from me. They came back to tell me he'd passed. I do regret it, but there are many clients who aren't with their pets during those final moments. My second pet I was present for, but my parents were not. They have told me they wouldn't want to be present for any animal death. I stayed with my other dog and it was very peaceful. They sedated her and I talked to her, petted her head, ect as they injected her. They'll find a vein, either on the back leg (most often) or a front leg. Just depends on where they can find a vein. Some dogs have crappy veins and it can take a few sticks to get it right, so be prepared for that if you stay. 

I'm sorry you have to go through with this.",1625790858,"if you do not want to watch, ask your vet to sedate your pet first (some do this as a standard but make sure) this way your pet will be asleep and unaware of what's going on, or whether you are there or not.","asleep and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asleep and unaware","asleep",NA,NA,0

"h4eo02h","To preface, Beliefs don’t always govern actions. Many things govern actions — impulses, feelings, external pressures, plans and intentions. Any given Christian should know that they don’t always act in favor of their beliefs and values. That’s not always on impulse either. But I still wouldn’t call it choice. 

Believing in free Will allows the person to live naive and unaware of the shackle of moral responsibility they’ve unnecessarily placed on themselves. From a belief in free Will follows an intentional agreement with feelings of regret, shame, and judgement. Overall negative feelings that need not be agreed with. What positive feelings might follow, when we believe we’ve actually made the right choices? Surely pride, a feeling of which Christians also tend to be critical. 

There is obviously more to it than that, more emotions and intentions tied to a belief in free Will. I think, overall though, the result of belief in free will bears net negative product. 

So what happens when the shackle is realized to be what it is? Well, though you may sometimes still experience those feelings, you can stand in stark disagreement with them. You can relax about the consequences of your past wrongs and focus on how you might change in the future. You can more easily practice humility, compassion, and forgiveness. There are still a few inevitable negative emotional experiences that come with it, but ultimately less so, as I’ve experienced, than with a belief in free will.",1625696557,"believing in free will allows the person to live naive and unaware of the shackle of moral responsibility they’ve unnecessarily placed on themselves.","naive and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"naive and unaware","naive",NA,NA,0

"h4cyv03","&gt; Equal and opposite? Only within the context of traditional gender roles.

No. Equality is a figment of imagination. Especially gender equality. It simply doesn't exist. 

&gt; By nature, men and women each evolved to have a separate and exclusive source of value.

True. But the value that we each contribute is not equal in any way.

&gt; For women, the ability to bear children. (Arguably the most important value to a species).

It's the bottleneck of the reproductive process, but it is not the most important element. Please, stop the pussy worship!

Granted. Humanity needs men and women. Humanity cannot survive without men and women. However, the process of gestation and birth is something that a woman can do in a coma. 

#In a coma!!!

A pregnant woman without the protection and provision of a man, is dead meat. She would be dead within a day or three. She cannot carry the baby to term without his support. She cannot raise her baby without his support. Even today, she has the support of the male collective, even if she doesn't have an individual man.

His support requires actual achievement. He must work and bust his ass, to protect and provide. He must succeed in life to accomplish his role in reproduction. She OTOH, can achieve her role while completely unconscious and unaware of what the hell happened. 

But because she's the bottleneck of reproduction, she's the most valuable??? Give me a break!

&gt; Each source of value actually created the closest thing you can get to a ""balance of reproductive value"" between the genders.

Traditional gender roles were balanced, but they were never equal. 

There is no equality between the genders. Not value equality and not legal equality and not any other form of equality.

"h3pco0s","That’s fair, your response makes a lot of sense with that context. And while I do agree that age differences in partners aren’t necessarily indicative of issues, it’s been my experience having been on this sub for a while now that an age difference of 4 years or more (especially when one of the people is younger than 23) is almost always the first red flag.

I personally think age is a big factor here. He’s (presumably) had the benefit of an education or at the very least 5 additional years of life on this earth to experience emotional growth. It seems from his inability to communicate or compromise that he has decided to waste that time instead, not growing as a person, and partnering up with someone who has not had those 5 years to learn so they literally don’t know there could be better situations for them out there. OP’s comments highlight this, as she implies that he is the best partner she thinks she can find. 

People who are older tend to go for younger people because they are inexperienced and unaware of better opportunities out there. They’re either the same level of maturity as the person they’re dating, which means that additional time on earth was wasted NOT growing, or somehow they’re even more immature. They know people their age are aware of this and will not tolerate it, however people that are younger don’t know not to tolerate it yet so they likely will for a period of time.",1625159886,"people who are older tend to go for younger people because they are inexperienced and unaware of better opportunities out there.","inexperienced and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"inexperienced and unaware","inexperienced",NA,NA,0

"h3nnlmx","Of all your preflop options, minraise feels like the worst. I wanna say that ideally your best option is jam - since the other 3 stacks are very short including a 5.5 and 6.5bb stack. When you jam there, SB is supposed to call off incredibly tight. IF villain is extremely loose and unaware of ICM even in this FT dynamic then I'd say don't jam. If you're not jamming, then your next best option would raising 3-3.5x. Limping isn't good when there's ICM pressure. But I also won't pretend to know exactly how we're supposed to play preflop overall. There are a lot of factors involved. I said the raising 3-3.5x is probably the next best option, but do we want to put that much of our stack in play when we only have 15bb and 2-3 guys are so shor? I'm not sure. But we definitely have some hands that absolutely don't wanna fold pre. KJo is probably just a little too strong for us to outright fold. Jam is always option #1. If player type dictates KJo not being a jam then 3-3.5x raise is #2.

It was my first time coming across this so it didn't click right away that it was off.

LUCKILY right after I sent the money I realized this felt off, did a little more research and that's how I learned my bank was basically about to overdraft a lot of money. My bank was helpful and cancelled the check, and helped me get the western union recalled so I got a full refund minus the fee for the western union which was more than fair. Walmart has a surprisingly good policy to protect people who are scammed in this way as long as it's your first time (and if you don't learn after the first time that's on you).  


I've since learned it's cash only for this shit because a lot of scammers try to take advantage of people just trying to sell shit online.

That being said, I got to understand how toxic she was herself and that she wasn't entirely faultless either, and she was totally clueless and unaware of her role in her problems.

The reality here is that no matter who is responsible for what, and who fixes what, you're the guy who's gonna get caught in the cross fire. As painful as it may sound, you may be left behind with nothing after the damage is done. Whoever moves on to heal afterward, it doesn't mean one is obligated to the other just because they stuck together during a dark time.

I say this because I have had some bad habits in the past, and it drove a wedge between me and my ex of nearly a decade. I saw firsthand how toxic negative behaviour affects a rs and how much damage your kind of thinking does to both parties. You're enabling things whether intentional, and whether you want to admit it or not.  

People mistakenly assume that just because we were there for the other in woe means there will be a happily ever after, and while that does happen, it's more likely that both people are left in the dust thereafter with nothing to show for it but a loss of years of life, and an inability to get back into the dating scene cos of how much damage and trauma they've experienced.

Anyway, I still have the post open, so here it is for posterity:

""Buckle up kids, we have a developing situation. First I'll set the stage and make a long story short. I (32M) and GF (F28) were renting when we received an offer we couldn't refuse from GF's father. Drastically reduced rent in an apartment off of GF's parent's house to allow GF to return to and afford returning to college. So we moved. This was our fatal mistake.

Dramatis Personae

Me- too old for this

GF- Girlfriend

The Gathering- GF's cousin, his wife and their 3 year old and a mutual friend

Karen- the hero of this tale GF's mother and future MIL

Karen's husband- he exists but isn't in the play

Kids- the readers

I came into the situation late and unprepared and unaware of the coming storm. Having left work I grabbed a quick dinner on the way and did the weekly shopping. I came home to a small gathering and not being a complete fuddy I put the groceries away and went out to the patio. They asked if I wanted pizza to which I being an adult who had already fed himself declined.

What I missed. Having arrived to only the gathering and GF I was unaware that previously Karen had also been present. They had been enjoying the pool when Karen disappeared. (To go buy a steak for her and Husband we found out later.) Remember this kids it'll come up again later. Gathering decides to order a pizza, this us when I came in kids. Gathering having known Karen for some time decided to call and ask Karen if she would like some pizza.

No answer. They decide to order a full pie and extras, to have extra should Karen and Karen's husband want some.

We'll jump to when the pizza arrives. Gathering begins to eat and proceed with the merrymaking. Que Karen coming out to cook her steak and she notices the pizza, and proceeds to become angry that no one asked her and that she would now go hungry having no other recourse despite gathering assuring her there is a whole pie and she can have some. She returns inside and slams the door. We being rational adults (including the 3 year old) continue behaving rationally.

This of course means we are speaking ill of her and she comes out and states. ""I can hear you motherfuckers."" Continuing to curse and call us ungrateful, thoughtless and rude while flipping everyone off. (Including the three year old) Not yelling yet mind you, just a loud talking.

Again Karen disappears and things return to a relave calm. I being a poor sleeper excuse myself to begin winding down for the next work shit, and go our apartment to play some Persona 3 before bed.

From below I hear it the shrieking. Karen I found out later was demanding that mutual friend take her side while chasing her from the home. The remaining gathering having demanded that Karen stop cursing in front of their child.

GF then comes and fills me in briefly before stepping into the bathroom. Then it happens kids, Karen barges into the apartment, our apartment and unable to locate her daughter finds me relaxing and playing Persona 3. And kids she unloads. Some of the highlights being ""The disrespect."" ""No one has any respect"" ""I do everything for everyone and get nothing"" ""It was wrong, GF knows it's wrong, mutual friend knows it's wrong, gathering knows it's wrong."" ""I'll raise the rent."" I don't know I was white knuckling it while fusing some personas. Luckily GF comes running from the bathroom to get Karen away before I lose my temper and start responding. Once done, she locks the door which remains close despite Karen running into it a few times for dramatic flair.

This is the ultimate reward for any Chinese-Americans who do science in the United States of America.

&gt;activists, legal scholars, and national security experts have argued that it rests on shaky foundations, is limited in its efficacy, and **fuels wide-scale racial profiling that has profoundly damaged the US scientific community.**

It's only shocking if you're naive and unaware of the history of the United States of America and how it treats minorities. In America, Chinese-American lives don't matter.

&gt;“It’s just shocking,” says Yasheng Huang, a business school professor at MIT, who brought together a group of academics, known as the Asian American Scholar Forum, to discuss these issues after his colleague Gang Chen, the head of MIT’s mechanical engineering department, was arrested for grant fraud under the China Initiative. “**The standard is incredibly low to put a guy in jail and charge him with serious crimes, destroying his life and destroying his career.”**

In American, it's pretty much a crime to be a Chinese-American scientist.

&gt;In an analysis of DOJ press releases covering 79 cases brought as a result of the initiative, the civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice found that **48% of them resulted in no actual charges of economic espionage,** but rather charges like wire fraud, tax issues, or other infractions that amount to disclosure mistakes on administrative forms

This is the real aim of this program. To blackmail Chinese-Americans into spying against China.

&gt;**Sadiku also tried to persuade him to become a spy for the US government,** using his Beijing University work as a cover.

This is how ""freedom"" and ""human rights"" works in America. 

&gt;Observers say the details of the case echo those of others brought as part of the China Initiative: **a spy probe on an ethnically Chinese researcher is opened with little evidence, and the charges are later changed when no sign of economic espionage can be found**

Basically, the FBI is just making up cases to fill up their quota requirements.

&gt;According to German, the former FBI agent, this is due to the pressure “on FBI agents across the country, every FBI field office, [and] every US Attorney’s office to develop cases to fit the framing, because they have to prove statistical accomplishments.” 

American freedom - how sweet it tastes.

The language is beautiful, the use of characters who are very familiar seen through a perspective which isn't the most common one, the depth of the emotion the protagonist feels when he loses his whole family to plague, yet survives...I'm not writing at the moment, and although I'm a very omnivorous reader and will just as happily read pulp sci-fi and thrillers as books that aspire to being high lit (and I've read highbrow books which are lumps of crap as well), the best books do have that luscious prose that keeps the reader hooked and unaware of the time and place that they're sitting in. (And this is not just the domain of litfic; a good thriller is written with pace and action in mind so that the reader is pulled through it seamlessly.

That sort of thing is what prose can do that some other media can't. Knowing how prose works is one of the most important parts of writing prose fiction. If you're writing a thriller, you need to know how the words pull you through the story so you can create the right effect on the reader. If you're trying to experiment, having a wide range of reading experiences means you can choose the right tools for the job. The best writers have all had that instinct down to a T: even the books that are fashionable to hate did something right for their particular audience.

"h2y7c7m","What Sardesai and gang have been doing for decades (they are after all typical marxists, just go lookup how they view media) Arnab does it 1000x better. That’s why they hate him. He’s beating them at their own game. 

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Hindu intellectual class is rising and that’s why they actually hate Arnab. He’s not only doing a better job than them at their own game, but undermining their entire life’s work and value system that was unjustly and coercively applied to a preoccupied and naive people. They are now paying the price for this betrayal, and their dying pangs gives me immense pleasure. That’s why I love Arnab, not for his journalism but for his acumen and acting as a conduit of exposure for probably the first generation of a Hindu intellectual class.",1624587041,"the hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening.","preoccupied and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely preoccupied and unaware","preoccupied",NA,"completely",0

"h2q89t2","So… when I was 5 years old I used to live in a cul de sac in Illinois. My father, being military, meant I moved quite often. I’ll get to that part.

So me and this girl lived adjacent from one another and we played all the time. We were in Kindergarten and 1st grade together. Hide and Seek, playing house, swimming, riding bikes, truth and dare was the run-of-the-mill activity list for us in this neighborhood.

Kids used to always tease us chanting “Name and Name sitting in a tree. K I S S I N G.” It was humorous and we’d often laugh it off, but one day we were over her house playing house and she just sat on her bed. I was pretending to cook and she goes, “Mmm it smells good, but can you come here and help me?” I obliged. She stared me deep in my eyes and said, “Why do other kids say we kiss when we haven’t?” Being 6 I didn’t have the world figured out let alone my favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. I shrugged I’m bewilderment. No idea found me. Put her lips did right she said, “We should.”

So that was my first kiss. But then…

*enters grandmother*

“WHAT ARE YOU TWO CHILDREN DOING??!!”

Me… scared as hell… looking at the floor where the piggy bank fell. “Counting pennies?”

Fast forward 10 years during yet another military issued move.

We stopped in St. Louis to visit family and my mother took us to the mall to get some school clothes and what have you. I remember Nelly being really popular at the time and at this age I was definitely into girls.

I saw this really pretty, petite, mixed girl with extremely curly hair walk by with some friends. Jokingly, I yelled out, “Ayo shawty what’s your name!” She turns around and both our jaws hit the floor.

There was 0 probability we mistook one another at that very moment. For a moment the world stopped. Everything around deafened and blurred.

We locked eyes for what seemed like an eon and we walked directly up to one another.

Only sentence she spoke:

“So that’s why the NAME REDACTED’s said our family should come for dinner…”

She awkwardly leaves and I’m just dumbfounded and unaware of what the hell is going on. Life just came full circle for me and I was having a hard time gripping the fact I just saw the story none of my early childhood friends believed: the owner of my first kiss.

Fast forward 3hrs.

We pull up to the same cul de sac I grew up in and great the family that invited us. Nice family with great values that were pivotal in my developmental years. Me and the other “child” (now teen) decided to go out and see the old neighborhood.

Almost in queue a white vehicle rolls slowly to a stop right in front of my old house and I see this small shadow step out of the backseat and start running towards us.

It’s her.

Not to bore with details: but we begin talking and begin finishing each others sentences. We sit closer and closer and decide to go out for a walk to view the neighborhood. We sit under our favorite tree growing up.

Her: “Can I admit something?”
Me: “Sure. What’s up?”
Her: “Things aren’t the same from when we were kids… but… I’ve never once forgot about you. You made my childhood fun. You made me feel… something I’m still not sure I’m familiar with.”
Me: “… love?”
Her: “Well you didn’t have to say it and kill the mood. You’ve always been quick to answer and never quick to think.”
Me: “… you mean spontaneous? Like when I fought off the asshole who crushed your snowman because you started crying?”

We both laughed until the last one could be heard echoing in the dusk.

We stood up and she just stayed there hugging me.

“You should come to Six Flags with my Church Group.”

I obliged.

Fast forward 8.5 hours which felt like a quick trip to Mars by bicycle.

My mother drops me off at her new house and we go in for breakfast.

Me: “Hey Mr. REDACTED! What ya cook?”
Him: “The only thing I’m allowing you to put your lips on in this house.”
Her and I lock eyes and our parents start hysterically laughing.

“Y’all didn’t think we knew?”
I began rolling my dunce cap.

We left as the van pulled up just in time to save us from the life support of embarrassment our parents subjected us to.

We shared headphones and listened to music the whole way. Unsurprisingly, we had similar taste. She started playing more and more love songs.

Fast forward $29 for a coke and hot dog later.

We are sitting in line for bumper cars and I’m excited to be doing something fun away from family. She grabs my arm and lets her friends run lady to get ahead in line. We sit there silently looking at the line. She then proceeds to stare at me. Her eyes read “Listen to me”. Confused me about as much as it would anyone reading that sentence.

“You know…” *drops pennies on the ground* “You’re pretty good at counting from what I can remember.”

Thus began the moment that defined me as a man til this day. A kiss stemmed from love. That would be the first, and last time I ever experienced that. And I cherish it as you would a family heirloom.

She’s married and happy now. I’m quite the opposite, but I still have this joy knowing this story is a chapter of my life.",1624418110,"only sentence she spoke:  “so that’s why the name redacted’s said our family should come for dinner…”  she awkwardly leaves and i’m just dumbfounded and unaware of what the hell is going on.","dumbfounded and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"just dumbfounded and unaware","dumbfounded",NA,"just",0

Here's a bit of a story that I'm very displeased with telling bit moreso that it happened.

I spent all of my 20s in an on/off again relationship with a woman in Louisiana that I met online. First time meeting, I flew to her, she bought but didn't buy a round trip flight, at 23,I thought nothing of it. Until I realized I didn't like her ways then I wanted to go. So I booked a Greyhound from Shreveport, LA to Sacramento, CA. Well, 23yo men don't know what the hell they want in a woman, they just know that they want to bury their PP inside of her. So I came back... and left. And came back. And left. I knew the southwest region of the US quite well. I knew of all the stops on the route. Well, my final time leaving, I had my own truck. I loaded everything up, punched in my destination on my handy GPS device and hit the road, driving 2017 miles, door-to-door. I drove non-stop from LA-AZ, only stopping for gas, cigs and Monster Nitro energy drinks.  Well in AZ, before Phoenix, I pulled off for cigarettes and gas, spending no more than 10 minutes at this Chevron. I did not stop or pause my gps.... This stupid effing device rerouted me while I was inside Chevron, I didn't realize it. (I really should've figured something want right when I wasn't being directed back onto I-20). Anyhow, I'm following my gps, not paying attention to the fact that I'm in a little ass rural town that feels like it was ripped straight out of GTA:SA, when my radar detector goes off. Laser radar.

"h2glpto","Thanks for clarifying - I'm responding to the original post for clarity. I don't need answers to the questions I'm going to ask, they are for you to consider as you reflect on this experience.

&gt;I study a lot of topics in school ranging from food chemistry to microbial physiology- for simplification purposes I am a molecular biology student going into my senior year. Going into the internship, I was extremely nervous because it was an engineering and business geared role, areas which I have 0 experience or education in. I felt like everyone was against me there and since this was a very social role, I crashed and burned immediately.

1) This experience didn't align with your area of study or experience. Why did you sign up/apply to be included in this role? What was your motivation in trying this direction? If you didn't meet the minimum expectations for this position (background knowledge, previous experience, etc.) why were you accepted by the company in the first place?

2) Why does the social nature of the role mean you crashed and burned? Why did you feel like people were against you? Was this an internal feeling or were there specific behaviors you observed from others? (If it's an internal feeling, maybe you could work on identifying and overcoming social anxieties you weren't aware of.)

&gt;On the second day, I was in the locker room and a crew leader was leaving at the same time as me. She looked at me and said, ""How do you like it here?"" I said ""This has been an eye-opening experience so far!"" She said, 'You don't have to lie to me and tell me you like it here"".

3) This speaks more to the crew leader's temperament than anything else. Was she having a bad day? Maybe she's a bit of a negative person. I would stop focusing on this interaction.

&gt;I am a woman (21F), the other 3 interns were guys. I got there on the first day before they all did because I am from the area and they were out of state. My manager had not arrived yet since she worked 2nd shift, but the manager I met refused to shake my hand. He pointed me to the room and told me to just sit down and go on my laptop. When he came back, my laptop wasn't working. He wouldn't answer me back. I asked him 3 times what was going on and he said, ""Not my problem, someone else will help you later."" When the other male interns arrived, he was asking them what universities they were from, telling them about our state, and asking them tons of questions. He left me out of this whole talk.

4) Did you arrive earlier than your instructions said to, or disregard any of the first-day instructions? This can cause any number of disruptions when an established team is welcoming new members.

5) Did you offer your hand for shaking first, or did the manager not offer his first and you view that as a refusal to shake hands at all?

6) As a person involved with onboarding, this entire greeting sounds wildly unprofessional. You should have been given clear instructions on what to do on your first day and who to speak to if you had issues. If your manager didn't start until 2nd shift, you shouldn't have started until 2nd shift. That being said, sometimes things do fall through the cracks and it's possible you were one of the things in this situation.

7) If your interactions with the rude manager were difficult and embarrassing for him, he may have responded to you the same way if you were a man - some people are just really socially awkward and unaware of their own behavior. To consider: did any of your own behavior make this situation worse (sitting off to the side, not introducing yourself when the other interns walked in, etc.)?

&gt;I have no experience with machinery. I've never handled a wrench in my life. One of my projects involved oil lubrification, so when I heard my project contact say something about drips of oil I asked what that was. She told me that was a dumb question.

8) Working with machinery is dangerous if not done correctly. There are no stupid questions. This person is perhaps a subject matter expert (SME, knows the job inside out) but not a qualified trainer. From this, you should learn how important it is to treat every question and questioner with respect.

&gt;When I expressed concerns about being underqualified, I was told ""You're a biochemist! I could never imagine being a biochemist. If you're smart enough to figure that out, you don't need our help. You can rise to the challenge alone."" Umm, I would not have gotten to where I am today without the support of many advisors, friends, and professors.

9) This person was trying to make you feel better. If they were in a position of leadership, they should have asked what areas you felt needed improving and should be able to identify those areas independently of your responses.

10) If proper training materials were not available for you, that is on the company. If they were, but required stronger background knowledge than what you had, you should have communicated that to your supervisor and asked where you could build your foundational knowledge on the topic.

&gt;I had an immense amount of stress in my personal life and medical stuff to handle. Since this was a day oriented job primarily, I had to take a ton of phone calls and inform my family of possible diagnoses. Admittingly, I did not spend as much time on the factory floor as I should have been. I found out from another intern, that the supervisors went to him and told him that I would be getting a poor performance review and they asked him if he knew why I was behaving the way I was. They shared details of my review with him and he told me I would not be getting an offer. No one came and spoke to me once. I informed them of the personal struggles and eventually they laid off me for taking time off the floor, but the damage seemed to already be done. 

11) If this is what happened, this is unacceptable behavior on behalf of you and the supervisors. 

11a) Your obligation was to immediately inform the supervisors of your personal situation (not details, just that you needed to take some time to deal with it). It might have been better to ask for the day off, rather than interrupt their workflow by being consistently, surprisingly, absent from the floor. Also, if your issue was causing untold stress for you and disruptions to your availability for the company, it may have been better for you to resign immediately, rather than expect them to just deal with it.

11b) It is absolutely never appropriate to discuss another team member's performance review. Your peer was wrong to participate in those discussions and the supervisors were wrong-er for including him in the first place and for not guiding you through an open conversation about what your behaviors meant for the team.

&gt;When I got my performance review, I was told I needed to be more emotionally expressive so that people would find me more engaging? I said, ""this isn't anything personal, I am just an introverted person."" When I asked for suggestions, I was given none.

12) I am glad you had a performance review in the first few weeks - sometimes interns aren't given that kind of feedback. Receiving feedback is hard - I recommend digging deeper into this topic for future review sessions.

13) Asking for suggestions on how to improve is great, but keep in mind that the expectation is that you act on those suggestions. It can be better if you offer suggestions on what you can do to improve in a way that is comfortable for you. For example, if they ask you to engage more and tell you that smiling more is what they expect, and then you don't smile more, you are not improving. However, if they ask you to engage more and you say that you'll ask more people about their work experience so far (and then do that!), you're meeting their expectations in a way that works for you.

&gt;I was placed in a room with large amounts of chili powder. At the 45 minute mark, I was hacking my lungs out with watery eyes. I ran back to the supervisors office and grabbed my headphones. They had popsicles upstairs and I was going go and eat one and listen to music. I found out another supervisor saw me crying and told everybody I hated it there after that. No one tried talking to me about what happened to see that I had chili powder in my eyes/lungs/nose.

14) This sounds like a lack of appropriate PPE. Either it wasn't available or you didn't use it. Your response should have been to inform a supervisor that you were having physical difficulties - companies generally have safety equipment like eye washes that could have helped.

15) Also, in my experience, listening to music is not an acceptable use of time during an internship.

16) Generally, these kinds of gossips are damaging to everyone in the workplace. It takes years of practice to learn how to deal with them effectively - as an intern, I think this is another opportunity to learn how not to behave in a professional setting.

&gt;On my last day, a supervisor asked me to go home early several times.

17) Were they being kind? Maybe they could see you were upset? Maybe your work product wasn't critical that day? Maybe they are a rude person. If they were your supervisor, you should have taken that as a signal to go home.

Its possible you got lucky. I have once or twice in my years, but doesnt happen often, and when it did, it kicked my ass. 33yo man freaking out in his buddies back yard on 3 tabs. Had a wonderful experience once i calmed down, but was way more intense than any 3 or 4 tab trip ive had prior.

Or maybe your lucky as fuck and got some of them killer swiss tabs i saw in the drugsdata page.

Take just one when you test it. Jugde effects based on personal preference, then you can either take more or less next time you trip and have a general idea on what to expect.

"h28mi80","Every now and then we’ll bond with someone in a truly special way, and every moment with them is perfect and unforgettable so we inevitably fall in love. We’ll hold that thought for weeks, or months waiting for the right time to tell them, only to find out they don’t feel the same way. 

This happened to me a few years ago, and it caused me a lot of pain but neither of us wanted to end the friendship. It was ok at first, but I was still in love with her fully knowing she will never fall for me. Our dynamic never changed, every moment together was still just as perfect, but that only made me feel worse, and our relationship became increasingly strained. We fell out in the end and haven’t spoken to each other since. 

If you know this relationship is impossible, why come back into it? You’ve already made a decision, and that was really brave of you. It will suck because if you two decide to be friends again, you’ll likely get on just as well as before. If you know he’s leaving it’s not worth chasing it. 

You’re not an asshole for making this decision, but he’s probably confused and upset. Based on your post it seems he really values your friendship a lot, I think you should talk to him about it, but make it clear you’ve made your decision and why, especially how you feel he’s deceived you. Hopefully he’ll learn not to do it to someone else in the future, because it sucks to be led on for nothing. 

Some replies are saying he’s manipulative. Maybe but as a boy I think he’s just dumb and unaware of the pain it’s causing you. Also he may actually like you but is reluctant to move forward because he knows he’s leaving, it’s easier for him to accept. 

When I was younger I never dated someone for more than a few months. I just had no fucking idea what I was doing, I was scared of commitment and unsure of where I was going with my life. Still got a lot to learn, but I’m much happier without chasing anyone.

"h1ut5s4","I have a theory that he intentionally pretended to be less socially aware initially than he truly was. If he had made the rest of the crew aware of his full understanding of biological society and psychology from the outset, they wouldn't have seen an impressive android, they would have seen a human with something *off* about him, and it would have landed him in the Uncanny Valley. Maybe he even had a bad experience with this in one of his previous assignments.

But by starting out a bit naive and unaware of the biologicals' customs, the crew got used to the fact that he was an android, not a human. This way they don't expect him to behave like a human would and the honest mistakes he makes are easily-forgiven because, well, it's known to happen.

Evidence:

* ""Accidentally"" broadcasting the girl's pleas for help in Pen Pals
* Expertly manipulating Fajo's assistant into letting him go
* Knowing how to handle an insubordinate temporary XO in Redemption II without having seen Picard do something like that (because he never had to)
* Knowing how to handle Worf in Gambit II and being aware that even honest and objective criticism without ill will behind it can have an emotional effect on him

**Gang name:** ""Ol'timers"" or ""Oldies"".

**Description**: Ol'timers is somewhat an elusive gang consisting primarily of ex (and presently employed) military and law enforcement veterans (whatever the ""law"" is represented by) of all races and all nationalities. Gang is providing protection and specializes in controlling ""clean"" medical and recreational businesses with extensive illegal backstage operation (unlicensed rigger docks, organ trafficking, unlicensed drug production etc) . It is possible that it can be tied to other bigger criminal organizations such as Yakuza or cartels, but then it is not clear if it is tied by business or simply has members infiltrated those entities.

**Recruitment:** There are always not enough money in your retirement fund, post-deployment consequences not covered by your medical, or  something you said somewhere what prevents you moving higher than a lieutenant.  What if I tell you that there is an organization which will help you acquire financial stability and support of people who understand you like no others? You probably don't even need to quit your current job. Call this number and you will get the feeling of your military brotherhood back. Just like back in the jungle when everything was easy and you knew where to shoot and who to trust. 

The only real requirement to become an Ol'timer is law enforcement or military experience (more the better) and passing the unofficial background check by gang's ""intelligence department"" (none likes snitches or people who pretend they are a vets). 

""Benefit package"" include medical treatment and implants for those needing them (at gang's illegal clinics), monthly monetary wage for every member, field operation bonuses, and support during incarceration. You may think that you are working for a small corporation. Just without rating and employees list. 

**Gang symbols:** An unusual (for a street gang) thing about Ol'timers is that they are trying to fly under the radar as much as possible and blend into the crowd in order to make their competitors paranoid and unaware of possible danger (or absence of such). Members of the gang most times wear plain clothes with weaponry and armor hidden underneath. 

There is one thing which Ol'timers use to identify their presence: lollipops (the ones you can find at doctor's office). Whenever they execute a successful hit or dispose a trespasser, they leave a single lollipop candy on each corpse. Jars of lollipops at the front desk of a business usually identify that a given establishment is under protection of Ol'timers. It is pretty obvious, that the choice of such ""business card"" format is not for saying anything about Ol'timers but rather identifying what they think about their competitors. 

**Philosophy:**  Ol'timers are basically an embodiment of unofficial inner ""clubs"" forming inside of the military and law enforcement organizations. People who look after each other, support each other, don't trust the official command, establish their own unwritten rules and codes of conduct. Only this time those people are organized in a network, have extensive cross-department cooperation and sources of an independent financing. 

**Modus operandi:** There is no base, no central location, no single place for meetups. All gang members are living their normal lives (possibly even working their jobs) to the moment they contacted by previously assigned intelligence officer who will tell them where to go and what to do. If the equipment they  have at their place is not enough, they will be directed to a drop-off container on their way to the target.  What will be the target? Anything. From a new recruit or a business owner asking for protection to a rally point for a raid to competitor's territory. 

Control over the protected business is established via Matrix monitoring and members of the gang residing close to the location (relocating or switching houses with other gang member if necessary).

Deep rooting of Ol'timers in law enforcement provide them significant advantage of extensive knowledge of what, how and when local cops will be doing and how to use it with benefit to the gang. There are quiet a few moles who siphon information to this gang. 

**Organization:** On top of Ol'dies' hierarchy is the ""committee of five"" or ""five heads"". Head of the accounting (responsible for monetary resources, paying benefits to gang members and money laundering), head of intelligence (background checks, acquiring information about competing gangs, monitoring protected businesses, counterintelligence activity), head of transportation (providing vehicles for the missions, delivering equipment and resources, making drop-offs), head of research (managing day-to-day operations of illegal facilities and providing medical care for gang members), and head of operations (planning and execution of in-the-field operations).

Then there are field officers and intelligence officers. Field officers are in charge of any face-to-face command during the in-the-field operations, while intelligence officers are in charge of delivering messages and communicating outside of in-the-field operations. Officers in charge are presented to their subordinates beforehand and it is strictly prohibited to follow orders from any other person even if they will call themselves higher ups of the Ol'timers gang.  

**Combat doctrine:** Ol'timers heavily rely on ambush tactics. They will blend with the crowd, use low-key vehicles and camouflage themselves to get maximum surprise effect. Sniping, explosives and drone ambushes are also popular. Open combat is very much not their style. The fact that they don't have a known number of members also means that if the competing gang will decide to attack someone who they consider an undercover Ol'timer, they need to constantly worry about possible attack from the rear or a retaliation which may strike at the worst moment possible. It is simply cheaper not to have any bad blood with Ol'timers, unless you are completely not valuing your people's blood an time.",1623695957,"**gang symbols:** an unusual (for a street gang) thing about ol'timers is that they are trying to fly under the radar as much as possible and blend into the crowd in order to make their competitors paranoid and unaware of possible danger (or absence of such).","paranoid and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"paranoid and unaware","paranoid",NA,NA,0

This is something people have discussed for a long time, the article itself is from 2016 but contains a quote from George Orwell first published in 1941:

&gt;England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “God Save the King” than of stealing from a poor box.

"h1pmi8d","Yes! Diagnosed at 40. Made a huge amount of financially and emotionally buggering mistakes up until now. Life getting better though! Feel like I have a roadmap now (neurotransmitters are dogshit, do this to make them better) so that's exciting. 

*Disclaimer:* I'm not a startup CEO, hoping to become the next unicorn, and I'm not a product-based business. I'm a pitch consultant who is doing OK and, once my personal finances are in better shape, I'll be able to live a very comfortable life from my business, while having a decent amount of personal freedom too. That's my goal, so these thoughts might not be applicable if you're slogging in Silicon Valley to be the next Bezos...

Since finding out about ADHD, I've found it easier to split thoughts around this into macro and granular. 

'**Macro' is strategic:** how does your business model fit with your strengths and best mitigate your weaknesses? What 'mindset' work are you doing to fix some of the flawed beliefs you have, either about your own abilities or how much you need to meet society's expectations?

*Example 1 (Business Model):* I am a consultant. I have some retainer clients. That's the mecca, right? Dead cert money! (And yes, it's definitely helping with the debt I piled up while undiagnosed and unaware of the various dysfunctions...)

BUT! I find working for these clients absolutely exhausting. It depletes me so much that I'm left with very little energy to put into scaling and efficiency. As soon as a project goes on for more than 4-6 weeks I'm mentally OUT. So I'm restructuring to try to bring in a steady flow of project-based clients instead. This is absolute madness in conventional business terms. But for me it's the only way I'll be able to maintain this for a long time, and that's what counts here. 

*Example 2 (Mindset):* I tried to do a product business on Amazon a few years ago. It was a disaster. It didn't feed into my skills (beyond a few weeks of hyperfocus), and beyond my overall concerns about the long-term viability of it, I also just didn't *give a tiny toss*. As sappy as it seems, I do like 'making a difference' and I didn't see how finding a marginally better dog pram to sell into the US was going to do that.  'Interest' is fundamental to ADHD. So before you worry too much about productivity, make sure you're doing something that means something to you; that lights you up in some way. As I said to a client of mine with ADHD, there is no point replacing a ladder with an escalator, if the ladder was propped against the wrong wall in the first place.

Honestly? A good business coach could spend hours with you on the macro alone. But even realising it as a category could be useful. (I'm not a business coach, btw. I've just done a lot of work on this)

'**Granular' is tactical:** how do you structure your day? How do you plan? What tools and processes do you use to help you work to *your* best?

*Example 1*: I work best in the mornings. I try very hard to keep all meetings to the afternoon, so I can use my best focus time on deep work. 

*Example 2*: I have certain tasks I will procrastinate on forever (mostly those of retainer clients). So I use Focusmate to get those things done. And yes, sometimes I procrastinate on booking Focusmate sessions. It's never a perfect system. But this work is getting easier, and that's a win.

*Example 3*: I use Trello boards to capture ideas as well as tasks (different boards for each). I have a Trello Chrome extension so I can save sites down to a card, knowing I can reference it again if I need to but it's not creating clutter in my brain. Average # of tabs open is now 15 vs 45. 

There are dozens of tactics you can use to be more 'productive'. I've probably tried 100 or more as when I was undiagnosed I got obsessed with productivity. Some work better than others, and I suspect it's largely based on exactly where your executive dysfunctions lie.

*One very important caveat:* I like finding productivity tools and tips to get useful or important things done. But I think it's also crucial to make time for joy and relaxation and curiosity etc. Some productivity gurus would have you fill your every waking hour with this stuff, which is self-defeating. The point of using these tools to get stuff done is to free yourself from the anxiety of not doing them, so you can create time for fun and joy. 

Anyway, hope some of that mammoth block of text is useful.

"h17q92e","&gt; Feral cats are domesticated cats that live in the wild by definition. Google it.

""In the wild"" simply means ""not belonging to any human"". Not ""outside of cities"".

Feral cats can and do live in cities and are indeed a problem in some places.

&gt; Domestic cats are nowhere near adequate vermin control in cities.. for every cat that is a subpar vermin hunter in the grand scheme, there are hundreds that won't even bother hunting vermin.

This is simply false. Cats are excellent at hunting vermin and kill hundreds each year. Moreover, their presence also deters such creatures from even inhabiting certain areas.

Anyone who has had a vermin problem then acquired a cat is likely to observe a very significant difference.

You are no different from such people.

Yes, cats absolutely make an enormous difference as to local rodent populations, and especially their boldness. One study of cat-rat interactions found that even though the cats only killed a couple rats over the course of a couple months, the presence of cats led to a 99% reduction in rat presence in the FOV of their motion-sensitive cameras, meaning that the presence of cats deterred the rats from venturing out into the spaces that cats occupied.

What is the objective ruling for whether a player is ""set""? The rules for a screen are as follows.

&gt; A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.

&gt; In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be. This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.

What is a ""normal step""? Some of these guys take massive strides, so according to the rule book and screen set for Jokic would have to be at least three or four feet away from the defender while one set for Murray could be half the distance.

What is ""an opportunity to avoid contact""? If a defender just doesn't look at the screen then it's a foul according to the rulebook. Does Ryan Anderson being defender necessitate screens be set further away since it takes him longer to avoid contact?

My point about being able to transmit HIV while testing negative is still accurate. Unfortunately HIV testing does generate a substantial amount of false negatives for a test for a viral infection. This is particularly true among recently infected individuals. These false negatives are the reason why it is recommended that when tested for HIV you have one test and then another at least three months after the exposure. This is known as the window period and is very well understood. It takes time for the body to produce the anti-bodies that are routinely tested for in an HIV test, about a month in most people. Tests that detect the virus itself have been developed but they still have a window period of 2+ weeks.

"h0xh420","Sorry, I know what you mean and my initial comment was just poorly worded, I just think this is a difference in the wording we use and not a difference in belief. 

Sexual maturity isn't something found in a single moment, children don't fully understand what sex means even when they're first made aware of it so while they can explore it naturally at their own pace, and as they get older might want it, they might also not be ready and still be learning. Delibrate attempts to be provocative are normal during this process but are more attempts at self exploration in a hopefully safe enviroment rather than genuinely asking for a full sexual relationship. Nothing wrong with peers at this age exploring together, but there is something wrong with an adult with full sexual maturity seeing this and taking advantage of this exploration. 

Still, I don't think even intentional sexual mimicry implies a full understanding of what that entails, it's a learning process y'know? A young teenager may know that they're wearing clothes that people may find attractive, and that finding somebody attractive may mean they want to have sex with them, and even the physical process involved with that, and they may intentionally wear it because of that but that doesn't give them a full understanding of what all of that means, to them or in general, which is only discovered as they grow more mature at their own pace.

Because it means that Marx's belief in the tendency of profits to fall - what he thought was his MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION - was false.

&gt; Because we live in a Capitalust world.

The correct answer is ""because capital goods are incredibly important to productivity"". And capitalists are who provide those goods.

&gt; Thanks for proving my point. Because it’s not the Capitalist tgat builds factories or makes equipment :P

Of course they did. They set up and built up the company. They didn't lay down every stone, but why would that be important?

If you pay someone to build a house for you, it's your house, not theirs.

If you pay someone to make a tool for you, it's your tool, not theirs.

It's the exact same thing.

&gt; One man doesn’t do all that lmao. Such a process is left to countless different people.

There are people at the top directing it all. Sometimes its one person, sometimes it's a group of people.

&gt; It is nothing without the worker. You can throw all the risk or investments you want at a mine. That won’t get you coal. Labour power is required to make commodities. And without commodities, capitalists have nothing.

Without capital goods, the workers are nothing.

This is the problem with narcissists - they fail to recognize that other people are important. They think they're all that matters.

It's worst with the people who have the least value - because they are in denial about it.

Which is more important - the workers, or the capital goods?

All we have to do is look at reality.

Capital goods multiply productivity *exponentially.*

It is the countries with competent capitalists who set up companies that have lots of capital goods that multiply productivity where people have a high standard of living.

Every country has workers. It's the ones that have the competent capitalists that are rich.

&gt; Yeah that’s why the USSR industrialised and modernised an agrarian backwater in a matter of years.

And yet, they were still very poor, whereas the Western and Northern Europeans were vastly wealthier.

The Asian Tigers did better than they did.

Indeed, South America did better than they did. People in South America are wealthier than the Russians are now.

They started out way ahead of many countries and now are behind.

Why is it that every socialist state sucks?

&gt; They have. There are quite clearly significant drops in the graph you posted.

That's not how *trends* work.

Data is always noisy.

You look in data in aggregate.

Stuff rises. Stuff falls.

The question is what the long term trend is.

And there isn't one. The data is just noise. Profit margins neither tend to increase nor decrease; they tend to oscillate around an average. The average they oscillate around changes from time to time, but it can go up and down as well.

It doesn't have any actual tendency to go in any particular direction.

&gt; Are you illiterate or something? I literally adressed this and how it doesn’t disprove the Tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

Saying something doesn't make it true. The data doesn't show any trend.

A lack of a trend shows means you're wrong. You keep clawing at your face and shrieking.

Everything you believe is not just a lie, but an obvious lie.

Anyone who has even the most basic level of ability to do numerical analysis knows you're wrong.

The graph shows you're wrong. You're clinging to the fact that it goes down sometimes, while ignoring the fact that it goes back up just as often. There's no net trend in either direction - it's just noisy data.

&gt; Yeah there is lmao, just look at the myriad of graphs I showed you

None of those graphs are of profit rates.

When you claim that profit rates drop, and your evidence isn't graphs of profit rates, it means that you don't actually have evidence.

It'd be like me linking to a graph of global temperatures and claiming that profit rates are rising because the graph is going up.

It's completely irrelevant and nonsensical.

This is why you are so upset. You are incompetent and unaware of it. You cannot even understand how to do analysis on a basic level.

Pseudointellectualism is a cargo cult of actual intellectualism.

You know that linking to data is what smart people do, but you don't understand what data to link to, or why that might be relevant or important.

&gt; But they didn’t. They didn’t exactly build it themselves ya’know &gt;_&gt;

They organized it.

Without them, it wouldn't exist.

&gt; Doesn’t change the fact that they still are extracing surplus labour value

Except that most of the value generated is due to the use of *their* capital goods.

How much of the value is due to the labor, versus the capital good that multiplies the productivity of said labor?

Facilitating higher productivity is insanely valuable.

The problem with narcissists is that they don't understand that when they operate an autonomous machine that cost a million dollars to build, they aren't the most valuable part of that system.

&gt; Good thing I’m not a narcissist then!

Of course you are.

You disregard the value of contributions of other people and your responses are all a desperate attempt to show how smart you are.

&gt; Bro this is literally one of the most important hallmarks of Socialism. It states tvat value is eerived from avereafe socially necessary labour time.

Yes, that is why socialism is built around narcissism.

The reality is that people work for ""capitalists"" because working in a factory multiplies their productivity by orders of magnitude.

The factory generates most of that value, not them personally. They're just one part of a much larger system.

Narcissists don't understand this, and disregard the value of everyone else, even though those other people are the ONLY reason why they can produce things of value.

They work in the factories because they generate far too little value working for themselves.

&gt; Riddle me this, who built that factory?

Who organized the builders?

Who set up the structure for this whole thing to exist in in the first place?

Heck, who is paying the builders in advance of anything actually useful being produced?

After all, the only way for a factory to produce value is *after* it has been built - but the people building the factory need to be paid beforehand.

Where does that money come from?

It comes from previous profits from previous ventures, or money lent out to people with a good business plan who can convince other people that this is something that scarce resources should be spent on.

The entire thing only exists because of those people who are organizing it and convincing other people that this is a good idea.

Without the organizers, without the planners, without the people who come up with these organizations - you have nothing to build in the first place.

You're a narcissist.

You cannot understand that these people are more important than you are.

Maybe if you could, you'd actually do something of value.

But you never will, will you?

Because that would require you to admit that you aren't special or important. That if you never existed, the world would go on, and it would probably be a slightly better place, because I wouldn't have wasted my time having this conversation with you.

Perhaps if you spent more time thinking about how to produce value for other people, rather than complaining about how you deserve more, you would *actually* deserve more.",1622892947,"you are incompetent and unaware of it.","incompetent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"incompetent and unaware","incompetent",NA,NA,0

"h0o4rzt","Scorpio Sun and Mercury tend to want to get very serious in relationships very quickly. Libra moon also yearns for a harmonious relationship partner.

However Venus and Mars in Sagittarius are less likely to ever settle down permanently and view love as something fun rather than something deep and eternal. 

There is therefore a disconnect between the Sun, Moon and Mercury which rule the self, emotions and thoughts wanting a strong, stable loyal relationship, and the Venus and Mars, which rule love and sex and drive, wanting a fun, more light hearted, and less intensely committed relationship. To put it in clear terms, there is a big part of them which wants to commit and settle down into marriage, but there is another big part of them which values freedom and independence and not being tied down. This explains constantly getting married, and then getting divorced.

As to lack of self awareness, I think most people will point out that Aries rising can be pretty socially unaware and aloof as to saying the wrong thing etc, however in the context of one-sided love, Scorpio can also be very oblivious and unaware of the other person's feelings. I have seen it so many times with close friends and acquaintances who have Scorpio Sun or Venus who genuinely believe they are in a long term committed relationship with someone, but the other person has no idea or interest in dating them.

That's not what profit rates are.

If you spend $X in a year, and make $Y, your profit rate is (Y-X)/X. So if your costs are $40 million, and your revenue is $50 million, your profit rate is (50-40)/40 = 25%.

That's what a profit rate is. That's what a profit rate *means*.

&gt; very roughly speaking, this means the logical way to produce a commodity, for example, is buying a given resource, paying someone to work on it and then sell the finished profit at a higher price than the total production cost. this means the product has a total value that's lower than what those who worked on it are being paid. that means the surplus was pocketed by someone who did nothing but own the machines and resources necessary to employ those who worked.

Larren took his final steps onto the precipice of the mountain, he was warned of the Djinni that lurked there, but someone had to confront the monster. Maybe he could talk some sense into it, he was feeling persuasive today.
He kept his sword sheathed as he waited for the encounter, so as to not provoke any action. As he waited he thought of the rest of his party, asleep and unaware of his venture. They had told him he didn’t stand a chance at convincing the Djinni (whose name he had forgotten) to stop attacking the city. But when has listening to reason ever served Larren, never, reason was for the faithless. 
He dared a peak over the edge of the cliff staring down into the ravine. As he did so he noticed an otherworldly heat on his face. The heat grew stronger and flames began to flicker on Larren’s vision. He rubbed at his now dry eyes and took a step back. As he did so he heard a mighty boom and when he opened his eyes again the form of the Djinni filled his view.
This thing was massive, thought Larren.
“I errrm, can I…take a moment of your time?”
The Djinni appeared to consider this question for a moment, then the heat around Larren began to get unbearable as a great sword was summoned into existence and the Djinni drew back to strike.

Several people from Ollie's stream began to raid Aruran's stream telling him to do an impromptu collab with Ollie.

"h04zjes","Personally, I didn't think much of the show when I first watched it a few years ago. When the second season aired I had barely any interest in it, but I still watched it. After finishing season 2 part 2 I had the urge to rewatch it, and I started liking it more and more. There are many videos on youtube way more convincing than anything I could ever write, that might be able to convince you to rethink your opinions on some aspects of the show. That said, I disagree with you.

In my opinion, Subaru is a pretty realistic character. Unlike most bland protagonists, he doesn't always make the right decision. In the beginning, he's selfish and unaware of his mistakes. I think showing us the ugly side of this character in the Royal Selection thingie was a pretty ballsy move by the author, as it could turn away many potential viewers. I like how that particular event was never overwritten, as it forces Subaru to change. Character development is one of the strong suits of Re zero, in my opinion.

As for Emilia, I would say that her selflessness is her strong suit (most people would give up knowing that they have pretty much no chance of winning based on their appearance alone), but that alone wouldn't set her apart from other heroines. In spite of her willingness to help others, she's not strong enough to do so. We are shown how much she consciously depends on Subaru, even when it comes to obstacles that she must clear herself (ie the trial). Eventually she manages to face her past and clear the trial, and I liked that. She's selfless, but not perfect. I wouldn't call her bland.

But if you want to talk about bias in news media and lack of criticism of those they’re supposed to hold accountable, we can do that too. The first misconception people have about media is that there is such a thing as unbiased news, that doesn’t exist. Different outlets will have different biases, and will critique different people. A smart reader will recognize those biases and look at how different outlets cover the same topics, and there will always be somebody covering just about anything. Bias is not an inherently bad thing. To act as though this is something new or unusual is naive and unaware of the history of news. Certainly recently there has been an increase in the concentration of ownership, but this is nothing new. 

There are also plenty of small independent newspapers and journalists who are not beholden to a billionaire.

"h02y9zc","&gt;The maturity of mind also implies inflexibility. On the other hand, if you have a kid in your early twenties, you allow yourself to grow from this new responsibility and challenge in a unique way. Why not incorporate the parenthood into your development, rather than trying to cope with an ever-changing task at your more inflexible age?

OK, I have my doubts about how accurate this is. Humans don't lose the ability to learn from their mistakes once they are older. So how can a 30yo or a 40yo be less flexible intellectually than a 20yo?

Also what happens if the younger parent makes a lot of mistakes with their first child as young parents often do? Will they mature into an inflexible older adult that will repeat their mistakes with all their other children?

It just looks like a younger parent will be maturing at the expense of their child, using it as a lab rat for trial and error. In the end we might get a more mature adult but also a damaged child because they were raised by someone who wasn't ready. 

It's the same reason why you don't appoint a university graduate as a corporate boss immediately, even if their grades are very good.

&gt;Why, though? It seems like most young people don't really know what to do with their lives, and without much responsibility to weigh them down they lean towards hedonism. On the other hand, if you inspire in them purpose and responsibility, they are capable of great self-sacrifice.

There are a lot of ""ifs"" and not a lot of guarantees. Giving a young person a child doesn't mean they'll grow responsible because of it. It's not a magical responsibility pill. There are plenty of young deadbeat dad and moms that have abandoned their children under the pressure of parenthood.

It's wishful thinking to assume parenthood will lead to responsibility. Also you do not want parents to feel like they are sacrificing their happiness for their child. Because then the child will be viewed as that burden that prevented them from being happy. You want potential parents to be happy and to want to share their happiness with a potential child.

&gt;Isn't the late 20s, early 30s a better time to make a decision about professional career? After you have matured, have figured yourself out, have understood what you need, what your family needs, what the world needs, etc? Essentially, to give yourself more time to explore the opportunities before you. You can still use your time to study for a field even as a parent, your family serving as inspiration and support, conversely, it is difficult to use this time to study how to be a parent, while you are busy with completely different stuff.

And you think it will be easier to build a career with 1-2 young children under your arms? This is logically improbable.

You do not want a couple of young parents with no concrete career to be going to the university, studding for exams and hopping between jobs; wondering what they want to do for a living while their children cry in the background demanding care and stable financial support.

Raising children on a low paying job is a bad idea. Studying for a career with young children is extremely difficult. Being financially unstable and hunting for a job with young children is a recipe for an absolute disaster.

If it will be difficult to study about becoming a parent while being busy with work in your early 30, how more difficult it would be to do it while struggling to build a career and rise the ranks to get better pay. This is essentially putting the cart before the horse.

Lastly the grandparents may be busy themselves, still working themselves, living in another city. It's not the grand parents' responsibility to raise the children of their children. Maybe 100 years ago when families lived together in one house this could be an option, but in today's world this is more and more less likely.

&gt;Because they are kids. One thing is to not have matured completely, and entirely different to be a kid.

See maturity is not a magical switch. A 16 yo and an 18 yo are only 2 years apart. They are not that incredibly different. One is just allowed to vote and to be sent to war. The same way a 21 yo is not that more mature than an 18-19 yo. The have somewhat more life experience, but they are still not too different either.

And that's why young parents are a bad idea. Parents in their early 20s are only slightly more mature than their late teen contemporaries. We call them adults, but they are still only just learning about being true independent adults. They still don't know much about themselves and the world and they definitely cannot be trusted with a baby that is even more defenseless and unaware of the world.",1622468938,"they still don't know much about themselves and the world and they definitely cannot be trusted with a baby that is even more defenseless and unaware of the world.","defenseless and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"more defenseless and unaware","defenseless",NA,"more",0

"gzvqox4","&gt;I first met my boyfriend on tinder, it was amazing and we were just starting off as friends with benefits because he had just gotten out of a relationship and I didn’t really want much at the time. A month had passed and we started to get to know each other better and I could feel myself falling for him. Given that I was still active on tinder, but not actively swiping (this is due to the fact that he had informed me that I could talk to whoever I wanted because we weren’t in a relationship, and I told him same for you). His friend had found me on tinder and had informed him of me being active still, and he had confronted me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I told him the honest truth but he was in denial and was acting like a boyfriend catching his girlfriend cheating on him. Later that month, things were better. I had fully fallen in love with him and same to him (or at least I thought). I wasn’t active on tinder, heck I even deleted me account. But fast forward to five months later I started to notice sketchy shit from him. He was an avid drinker, would get blacked out drunk everyday and when Covid hit it only made it worse. He would stay at my place drinking while I was off at work trying to make money to help me and him survive, and that he was always active on social media but never texting me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So one night when he passed out from drinking, after peeing all over my floor in his sleep, his phone was blowing up with text messages from a girl I was a little worried about. See this boy doesn’t keep his notifications hidden (which is already kind of bad on his part because I found he had been talking shit about me to another girl). He told this girl that I was controlling and that he was stuck at my place that I wouldn’t let him leave. I worked 8 hour days and he had his car at my place, he was free to leave whenever he wanted. I even told him many times that if he wanted to go home to hang out with his friends or sleep in his own bed, he was more than welcome to.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But he often shot me down and told me he loved me and loved hanging out with me. He even told this girl that he was taking care of me and helping me survive by working long days and me being lazy. I was upset and slept on the ground in my own bedroom, upset and shaking. I had just cleaned his pee from my floor and all of his beer bottles from my bedroom and he had the decency to talk shit about me to another girl. He apologized the next morning saying that he was a piece of shit and that he loves me and can’t leave me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;All of forgiven but not forgotten. Fast forward, his phone broke so I bought him a new one and even helped him pay his rent while I was paying my own. But was never truly grateful because a week later I caught him sexting girls on tinder and asking them to come over to my house while I was at work. He apologizes for his wrongdoing but like I said all is forgiven but not forgotten. My birthday passes and I think everything’s great and that he has changed, he’s caring and rarely on his phone but then the day after I attend his families thanksgiving and the night I was working 12hrs overnight at a new job, he had cheated on me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The only reason I found out was because of this girl, she hit me up bragging how she slept with my boyfriend and called me a bunch of names. This happened while he was blacked out drunk and passed out. My world shattered because while he was out hooking up with girls I was helping him with anything and everything. I shook him awake because I wasn’t leaving until I got answers, but I honestly should have left. I got called names that I will never repeat, so I grabbed all of my shit from him and left, even blocked him off of everything. But I had forgotten one account and the next morning he had texted me long paragraphs about how sorry he is and how amazing I had been to him.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He told me that he was crying at work because of how sad he was when remembering my hurt face. I kind of forgave but couldn’t fully. A friend had introduced me to a guy, and I thought nothing of it. I viewed him as a friend and nothing more. Me and my ex (or whatever we were) were still talking and helping each other out, to which this new boy knew about. Even my ex knew about the other guy. But one night I had sexual relations with the new guy while drunk and unaware of what I was doing. I tell my ex or whatever he is about it, he’s clearly pissed and starts to tell me that he fucked a girl I was insecure about four times in the past month, even though he told me he was trying to make it work and better himself for me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But I’m young and in love and forgive him, and tell him we’re even. Now I’m always scared what he’s doing on his phone, but I think he realizes how horrible we both have been to each other and how I’m trying to ensure this relationship works out and that now he’s trying. But I’m not getting my hopes up, because like I said before I forgave but I never forgot.

"gz30oew","Not to go to extremes here, but what we are seeing in business is a reflection of the attitudes of society.  There is a series of phases every civilization goes through from rise to fall.  

Ted Flynn’s book The Great Transformation provides a great deal of perspective to what we are currently experiencing..

From bondage to spiritual growth – . American culture was formed by the injustices that grew in colonial times. Sufferings and injustices cause—even force—spiritual growth. Suffering brings wisdom and demands a spiritual discipline that seeks justice and solutions.
From spiritual growth to great courage – Having been steeled in the crucible of suffering and the ability to endure ,  leaders emerge and people are summoned to courage and sacrifice (including loss of life) in order to create a better world. People who have little or nothing, also have little or nothing to lose and are often more willing to live for something more important than themselves and their own pleasure. A battle is begun, requiring courage, discipline, and other virtues.
From courage to liberty – As a result of the courageous fight, the foe is vanquished and liberty and justice emerges. At this point a civilization comes forth. Heroism and the virtues that brought about liberty are still esteemed. .
From liberty to abundance – Liberty ushers in greater prosperity, because a civilization is still functioning with the hard work. But then the first danger: abundance. Things that are in too great an abundance tend to weigh us down.  the struggles that engender wisdom through discipline fall away. living on the fumes of earlier sacrifices; its people become less willing to make such sacrifices. The discipline and virtues responsible for the thriving of the civilization are increasingly remote from the collective conscience.
From abundance to complacency –  to be self-satisfied and unaware of trends that undermine health and the ability to thrive. Everything looks fine, so it must be fine. Yet foundations, resources, infrastructures, and virtues are all crumbling. As virtues, disciplines, and ideals decay, those who raise alarms are labeled by the complacent as “killjoys” and considered harsh, or judgmental.  Or conservatives or ""fascist nazis""
From complacency to apathy – a lack of interest in the things that once inspired. Many seldom think about the sacrifices of previous generations and lose a sense that they must work for and contribute to the common good. “Civilization” suffers the serious blow of being replaced by privatization in growing degrees. Working and sacrificing for others becomes more remote. Growing numbers becoming increasingly willing to live on the carcass of previous sacrifices. Hard work and self-discipline continue to erode.
From apathy to dependence – Increasing numbers of people lack the virtues and zeal necessary to work and contribute. The suffering and the sacrifices that built the culture are now a distant memory. As discipline and work increasingly seem “too hard,” dependence grows. Suffering of any sort seems intolerable. But virtue is not seen as the solution. Having lived on the sacrifices of others for years, the civilization now insists that “others” must solve their woes. This ushers in growing demands for governmental, collective solutions. This in turns deepens dependence.
From dependence back to bondage – As dependence increases, so does centralized power. Dependent people become increasingly dysfunctional and desperate. Seeking a savior, they look to strong central leadership. But power corrupts, and tends to usher in increasing intrusion.  Family and personal virtue (essential ingredients for any civilization) are replaced by despotic centralized control, hungry for more power. the civilization is gradually ended, because people no longer have the virtues necessary to fight.
Another possibility is that a more powerful nation invades and replaces it with their own culture.",1621710225,"from abundance to complacency –  to be self-satisfied and unaware of trends that undermine health and the ability to thrive.","satisfied and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"satisfied and unaware","satisfied",NA,NA,0

"gyzrcj6","So, im a main evie since 2016, the amount of bullshit you just said makes no fucking sence. Meta evie yes is the wormhole ( with sustain and range on blink, filler to get cooldown reduction or speed on the soar or give 2 ammo after ice block or 1 after soar, lots of fillers), snowglobe and over the mone are most likely terrible choises if you play at higher ranks (if you play at low rank i cant believe you are a good evie player). The only time i think other legendary is better than wormhole is SnowGlobe with dive comps ( the best one would be ruckus and maeve but if your dps are hitscan is good to change maeve to evie brcause of her blast) and there snow globe is good because you use the ult as a skill and give the offtank more free time to punish theyr flanks or dps.
Evie heath no need to be buffed (uou are right about this), but her card needs a buff yes, 30 health per level os the weakest in the game and aperantly you dont know this but the card is buged so you get 29 health insteed or 30 and sometimes the card dont even activate, this card is important as a filler because of strix or kinessa 1 shooting her on headshoot without forcing you to buy haven. 
About evie shoots no nerfed needed on the dmg and neither a buff, yet seeing her with 0.8 or 0.7 (like drogoz) would be interesting but its better to stay the way it is, the projectile cant be even slower so other way evie will become that she was before (super slow shoots where making the aerial playstile impossible to accomplish, and since you seem to pray for ""good players"" or skilled players this all i have to say). Her dps is low being 850, androxus lex moji skye buck vatu vora maeve, all other flanks hae a higher dps then evie, no need ro toutch this. 
About the iceblock a little dmg was good to be back (yes back) evie used to be able to not only teleport inside the iceblock (once she reaches the teleport the ice block was instantly over, avoiding once again the ""camping"") but she also dealed dmg after the iceblocks explodes being later removed (this feature was in paladins strike just to have an idea) so adding this back trough a legendary was interesting.

Now about the Sha Lin part, i thnk you probably got hitted by something called "" Counters"" evie is viable pick obly if the match is good for her (at high rank once again), the meta as been horrible for her this last 2 years, first lian and cassie on meta (got nerfrd) then the super strong offtanks (got nerfrd) thethen viktor and vivian rising (got nerfed) then shalin (nerfed, and one of the best evie counters in game because of the criplle and burst melting more then halfh evie health) then bk (nerfed and bugged like other AOE characters that you probably dont even knoe about) then now tiberius vora androxus dredge khan furia dmg grover criplle all in the meta to counter evie. 
So sha lin play styke did not change a single bit, only he his finnaly a strong character and finaly can punish an evie, not theyr fault you try stupid things (like saying evie decks should not be focused on self healing).
 In conclusion you tried to look smart and a very good ""evie player listen to me"" and ended up looking very stupid and unaware of the things about her, and you tryed to ""ashame"" the AoC member for no reason.

"gytvp2m","You might be thinking, “What is this metal thing?”. If not, cool… I oncehad a guy assume it was a refrigerator. He never even questioned ituntil I told him what it was. A lot of people see many things withoutany clue as to what they really are every single day and never reallyquestion anything. Well thinking this is a refrigerator or whateverwithout figuring out what it truly is, is like automatically assumingthe first computer you ever saw was nothing other than a battery orsomething. Anyone who thought that, might not ever get to discoverBlender… Along with everything else a computer is capable of. Imaginethe same scenario for many other things. In this case, the metal thingis a cryostat. It is a large container filled with liquid nitrogen. Thecontainer is about 11ft tall and although liquid nitrogen is -196degrees celcius, the outer layer of the cryostat is room temperature.Between the inner and outer layers is a vacuum without air like athermos bottle. This way, the liquid nitrogen boils away at the slowestrate possible and the cryostat needs to be refilled less often. Why isit outside though…? That has to do with what is submerged in the liquidnitrogen and my own artistic expression. People are kept inside thesecryostats. About eight people are kept in each one of these cryostatsand maintained within cryostasis at freezing temperatures so they can bebrought back to life in the future when it is possible to do so. Thereare various versions of cryostats that all look unique and that are usedat different facilities, but this one specifically is used at theCryonics Institute in Michigan. It is outside in this artisticrendition, because it represents the experience and the memories thatthe cryopreserved people have in cryostasis. They are mostly unknown,they are alone, and they are waiting for scientists to develop thetechnology to revive them. They are unconscious and unaware of theirsurroundings. To them, they might as well be anywhere. Although they arenevertheless alive, there is also no telling how much of their memoriesare retained since some amount of decay is likely involved and thecryopreservation procedure itself has a few harmful effects. As suchwith broken memories, perhaps only fragments of their personal lives andcore understandings of nature remain etched into their minds. Hence thescattered pieces of the cryonics facility lay thrown about the forestfloor as if it were a vague dream. What neural connections remain in thecellular structures of their brains may even be lost further during thereanimation process, like these pieces of the facility may be lost tothis ever-changing environment.

"gy10kji","Finding someone with only their IP is very error prone and usually wrong. The IP that you see is probably routed through various ISPs and a home network. Even if the IP address that you have is correct, they're most likely on a dynamic IP, and it's likely to have changed between the time you got it and now. It is very likely that any information obtained in this way is going to not just be wrong, but point to someone completely unrelated and unaware of the situation. I would recommend avoiding that entire line of thinking. 

If you want to get a person's info, get all of the information that you can from their profile. Depending on the person, they might have their approximate location, pictures they've taken, places they've visited, major life events, etc listed right there in their tweet history. Check out who follows them and who they follow - make a graph of the locations of all of their contacts, two or three deep, and you can be pretty sure that the most common location is either where they live now or where they lived previously. Compare any life events you've found with public records from the area (weddings, funerals, divorces, births, really big parties, arrests, housing records). Check the photos and do a reverse image search, maybe you can find other profiles they've created where they posted the same image. Of course, Google the username - again, maybe there's other profiles with more info. Check Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace (seriously), Pinterest, Instagram, etc. 

Basically, the rule is, use any info you have to link to more info. Be aware that collecting publicly available information is _not_ illegal. (Although harassing, stalking, and intimidating people is, but this is ILPT.) Also be aware that other people can _just as easily do it to you_ (probably easier, if you're not actively trying to prevent it), and it's not illegal for _them_ either.

You told him you were uncomfortable and set a boundary. He twisted your words around, told you that your personal, physical boundaries are wrong, and then made you feel badly so that he doesn't have to change or show you respect.

If he does this in other aspects of your relationship, you need to re-evaluate the relationship and make sure that it's actually healthy.)

I have told you before that you touching my breasts, butt, and privates so often makes me uncomfortable. I have asked you to stop before. I am no longer asking. I am telling you to stop. I am setting a boundary. If you want to initiate physical intimacy, that's fine, but only in situations when it's appropriate, like X, Y, and Z. Not at the grocery store or in front of your mother.

I love you very much. But my body isn't available whenever you want it to be. I'm a person, and I'm allowed to have boundaries."" If he starts to guilt you, you shut that shit down.

"gxxb6wz","And to be honest, too many Christians don't take the time to read the Bible either. So you're not in bad company in any way.

&gt;But i feel like it's still kinda accurate.

I'll address something you said previously. Lucifer does not torture anybody. Lucifer ends up getting thrown in hell. But that's his necessary outcome for his behavior. There is no torture in hell. How is a place of non-existence for previously existing spirit being. It's no different than our grave is for the dead physical bodies. Hell is just a place for dead spiritual bodies.

And, if you don't mind, I'll give you a brief overview of scripture. That you can put in your back pocket and think about if ever you have in mind to think about it.

We were given a physical body. That physical body comes with a desire to want to not die. The part of your body that is responsible for maintaining your survival, is called your amygdala. This is something that you can look up on the internet. It is responsible for managing your memories, your emotions, and your survival strategies.

Growing up, as a toddler you start to figure out that it is really good to feel good and it is really bad to feel bad.

As a young teenager, you start to figure out that it is really good to look good and it is really bad to look bad. It's even good to associate yourself with things that look good and it's bad to be associated with things that look bad.

And finally as a young adult, you start to figure out that it is really good to be wise and aware and it is really bad to be unwise and unaware. You will spend the rest of your life trying to figure this one out.

There's more to it. But let's just say that we spend our life trying to survive the experiences we don't like. Like feeling bad, looking bad and being considered unwise and unaware. Of course we also celebrate and enjoy life the most when we are feeling good, looking good and are being considered wise and aware.

If you read the short chapter of Genesis chapter 3, you will read the story of when Eve was considering eating the forbidden fruit. What she says is that she recognized that the tree would be good for food, meaning It would feel good to eat. She says that the tree is pleasant to the eyes, meaning it was good to look at. And the real kicker is, you says that the tree was desired to make her wise. 

Scripture let us know that these three main desires are a part of our physical major, which is different than God's nature. Specifically, we have our body that comes from the world. And then we have our spirit that comes from God. 1 John 2:16 let us know what's going on with us, and let us know what was going on with Eve right before she ate the fruit.

Now there's nothing wrong with having a body. But have you ever noticed that life is much more than simply surviving? And let me illustrate it this way.

If the only thing that was important was making sure we had enough food, proper shelter, and close to where. And maybe some good medical care. Then as long as we had that in our life, then we shouldn't have any issue with slavery. Or a different example would be, if we had all of our physical needs met, like the physical needs of a zoo animal, and we shouldn't have any problem being in jail.

And here's my point about this.

There is something about us as humans that longs and yearns to have an experience that goes beyond mere survival. It is vital that we experience freedom. And therefore slavery is unacceptable. It's also vital that we experience our ability to cause and create things. And therefore prisons are unacceptable.

The only other desire that goes beyond mere survival, is our desire to cause create wonderful things for people that we care about. Including ourselves.

So this is how I describe it. There is a part of us that desires to experience freedom. Specifically, the experience to cause and create things that are wonderful. Specifically, the experience of love, joy and peace for others and ourselves.

Scripture would call this part of ourselves our spirit. But some people don't believe we have a spirit. But nobody denies that freedom, causing and creating, and the desire for love, joy and peace in our lives, is common to everybody. So what you call it is an important.

All of scripture is all about the discovery that when you are stuck in mere survival mode, it has a tendency to kill, steel and destroy your desire to experience freedom to cause and create the experience of love, joy and peace for others and yourself.

All of scripture, is a story, and a plan, about how to overcome being stuck in mere survival mode, while learning how to walk with some level of mastery, in a way that allows one to experience the freedom to cause and create the wonderful stuff.

Now this is in a very simple version of what's going on. But it is an overview that I'm sure you have never heard of.

"gxvsggv","What Sardesai and gang have been doing for decades (they are after all typical marxists, just go lookup how they view media) Arnab does it 1000x better. That’s why they hate him. He’s beating them at their own game. 

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Hindu intellectual class is rising and that’s why they actually hate Arnab. He’s not only doing a better job than them at their own game, but undermining their entire life’s work and value system that was unjustly and coercively applied to a preoccupied and naive people. They are now paying the price for this betrayal, and their dying pangs gives me immense pleasure.

"gxu2x58","&gt;There’s no such thing as someone with a PD that’s self aware

and

&gt;when so many seek diagnosis simply because they ‘relate’ with said traits

Surely there has to be some semblance of self-awareness to understand the traits that you live with are enough of a problem to seek a diagnosis?  Sure, not every will do this, nor will some people care - either because they lack the ability to do so or just simply don't want to care.

I do.  I've struggled with depression all my life since my very early teens.  I've known I wasn't like other kids, like other students at college, like the people I worked with during my ridiculously varied career.  I had enough awareness to know that my depression alone was not the reason for this, but that it was yet another symptom that lead me to a journey of self-discovery.  I'm not saying I have SPD (yet) because I have sufficient reason to think it might be, but I am sure seeking a diagnosis to examine the possibility.  It might be something else (AvPD for example) entirely.

&gt;A personality disorder are traits which are ingrained in a person

Yes.   And for a lot of PD's they can start to be seen at certain ages.

&gt;in the sense they lack the self awareness to see how their personality is a problem

I know I am a problem.  People have told me.  I have figured it out by feeling fucking awkward when I've done something against the social norm.

&gt;Someone that is aware enough of their issues is an unlikely candidate for a PD.

Tell me - how do people go about getting a diagnosis for a PD?  They have to recognise that there is an issue with their personality, their behaviours, their mannerisms.  Once someone becomes aware of these things, then they can look at what to do about it - ignore it, try to live with it, get help for it, get a diagnosis for it.  It all starts with the realisation that there is something not quite right with the self that needs attention.  I'd hazard a guess that many with diagnosed SPD don't really follow through with treatment, but having the diagnosis gives them a point of reference to understand why they are the way they are.

I'll end with a quote I read regarding the self-awareness of the schizoid:

&gt;Although there is the belief people with schizoid personality disorder are complacent and unaware of their feelings, ***many recognize their differences from others***. Some individuals with SPD who are in treatment say ""life passes them by"" or they feel like living inside a shell; they see themselves as ""missing the bus"" and speak of observing life from a distance.",1620812665,"i'll end with a quote i read regarding the self-awareness of the schizoid:  &gt;although there is the belief people with schizoid personality disorder are complacent and unaware of their feelings, ***many recognize their differences from others***.","complacent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"complacent and unaware","complacent",NA,NA,0
"gxtvabq","Saw the trailer and had a feeling it would be feminist trash and so saw the YouTube movie clips and it was. Feminist Karens in the comment section going ""yes queen"" to all the intentionally distorting words like ""nice guy"" and ""crying wolf"". Portraying women when drunk are innocent and unaware of surroundings while men when drunk are aggressive and conscious and consenting. drunk woman = victim, drunk man = predator. When in reality, for these situations usually both are too intoxicated to know whats going on and both are legally at fault but fact is they both are incapable of understanding what they are doing. She literally helps 2 girls get drunk/drugged and, supposedly, raped and scares another woman into agreeing innocent until proven guilty shouldn't matter by making her think her daughter is drugged and going to be sexually assaulted. The movie portrays it's okay because she is justified to extract revenge... even though she wasn't the one that was supposedly the victim, it was her friend who later offs herself.

The message of the movie was another #BelieveAllWomen and #metoo that innocent before proven guilty should never be considered because women are always good and truthful... meanwhile she lies, blackmails, drugs, damages property and assaults people. She finds guys drunk or on drugs, pretends to be drunk too and then reveals she isn't then goes ""how dare you"". They just take common words/phrases in these televised cases and try to give them all bad connotations when the context they were used in were much more grey. They act like every situation is girl is telling truth and society doesn't believe them because it has always been the case and never have situations as bad as the UVA rape story, aka ""A Rape on Campus"" never happened multiple times were girls lied to get an advantage and got caught and even after exposed the boys falsely accused are still harassed and can't find jobs because they are forever treated like ""they were guilty, they just must have gotten away with it""... even when the girl doesn't even exist in some cases like UVA and feminists still had the nerve to say ""they are still guilty""

Disregarding the feminist politics aside, the story is boring, the ""plot twist"" isn't a plot twist and super cheesy, and the action that is ""so well done"" is more mediocre that Starship Troopers 2 acting.

"gxt89g0","The thing is, they clearly have ways of altering and implanting memories, so we really can't trust any of the reported details of any of these experiences. They could all be pure hallucinations or a mix of real and fake memories.

Because of that, it's impossible to deduce any motive or understanding from these details.  Anything they tell us or show us could be a lie, and based on the sheer number and  contradictory nature of reports, that seems to be the case.

Knowing that, all we can really look at is the effect and outcomes of these events, and the fact they are happening at all.

Strip away the details and you will see where the consistencies lie. 

There is some sort of intelligence behind them, that is capable of constructing believable narratives for us. It seems to know things about us and be able to communicate with us. It seems to have some level of ability to predict future events. It wants us to listen to it and believe it's narratives, and doesn't seem to like it very much when we don't. 

At times it drives us into conflict, yet it also sometimes helps us and may even feed us insight and technology. 

Some think it wants to make us fight each other, either to keep us distracted or to feed off of our negative emotions or maybe even to ultimately make us destroy ourselves. If it wants our complete destruction it seems to me it would just do that itself in a myriad of ways, so that's good (either it doesn't want to or it can't, both good options).

It could be that it wants to keep us enthralled and unaware of it, so that it can harvest us or use us for whatever ends. If that's the case, we might be playing with fire a bit by trying to figuring it out like this... 

I think another possibility is it is trying to help us evolve in its own way, by driving us forward through pushing our beliefs and knowledge along, and at times yes making us fight (look how much stronger we got after WW2...

Super frustrating and self defeating for the gun community here.

Currently, I've been getting a lot of 2 wands/swords/pentacles in my readings about myself and it's made me scratch my head as I don't think I have any choices in front of me- or at least I thought I didn't. So I asked my deck using [this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/835623208437678160/841515835927167017/Screenshots_2021-05-10-23-23-00.png) wonderful spread someone linked in Discord. 

I shuffled and pulled the cards + a subconscious from the deck. 

**What crosses me:**  4 of swords reversed + 2 of swords 

**Option A:** The star reversed 

**Positives of A:** Death 

**Negatives of A:** Queen of Cups

**What do I need to do/change to get to A:** Page of Pentacles Reversed

**Option B**: 2 of Cups

**Positives of B:** 8 of Swords Reversed 

**Negatives of B:** Ace of Pentacles Reversed

**What do I need to do/change to get to B:** Page of Cups

**Advice:** Judgement

**Subconscious:** The Devil Reversed 

My short and lovely interpretation is: 

What crossing me right now is the recovery coming out of rest, or maybe I'm not resting that much and self-love - I might be pursuing someone who doesn't want me- and I'm very blinded and unaware of what I need to do and I know I need to make a choice. 

For option A- I think this is about great disappointment and leaving something I didn't want to and feeling like the world is on my bad side. But, it's good as it's close to a chapter and gives room for rebirth! If I leave though, I might think with my heart too much and might feel clingy and disappointed about my choice. I need to start letting go and taking time away, remembering what I wanted earlier to get to this option. 

For option B- someone or something will offer me a partnership (Friendship? Love? Business..? I am in separation from someone but I don't think this might be pointing to it). If I go with it, I'll be freed and I'll get a new perspective on a relationship with whoever is coming and offering me that cup. But, I might miss a lot of chances I could have had without them and it could be a very rushed and irrational decision without thinking. To accept B, I need to start accepting my emotions being okay with them, and understanding them more. 

Advice: Learn from the past, there are consequences for every action so any choice will have that. 

  
Subconscious: Freedom and reclaiming control!

I do want to add a few things though, most of them are reasons why I think Ozma went about implementing these motions. One, Ozpin(Ozma) had a direct hand in creating the Academies because it gave him a position he could 'earn' that wasn't one that he had to be born into, plus it came with a number of benefits to it. It held a position on the governing council, one that wasn't voted in, thus allowing for Ozpin to hold it for long periods of time. It allowed him to train up warriors to be his tools in his shadow war against Salem, selecting those who were suitable for use as his 'agents.'

As for the military, he utilized public opinion which saw the civilian population direct their ill-founded belief that their existence was responsible for all the suffering that happened, because for what other reasons do armies exist except to fight other armies.

There are mountains of research showing how tiny cues can radically change people’s perceptions. That’s the entire point. Being a racist doesn’t mean feeling that you are, it doesn’t require any effort at all. It’s effortless. 

What requires effort is not being prejudiced. Realizing that all your impressions are formed in part by your culture and being aware of that and acting to correct for it.

One thing that makes depression very difficult to manage is when you are dealing with people that have never experience depression.  They really aren’t being bad or uncaring they just have no idea what you are actually going through and the only experience they have to compare is not even relevant.  

I am saying this as someone who developed depression later in life.  Before it hit me I had the same attitude as your parents.  I know the place I was coming from wasnt one of malice or actually lacking empathy.  I was simply ignorant and unaware of my place of privilege not having an issue that affects the very core of our human wiring.  Now that I’ve gone through it I’m horrified at the way I tried to “help” friends.  Horrified enough that I had to reach out to people I hadn’t spoken to in years to apologize for the abysmal way I treated them. 

What I’m saying doesn’t excuse what they are doing.  Those actions are hurting you not helping you.  The only possible way to get them to understand without having them go through it themselves will be through the help of an educated professional.

""Were not Western wannabes!""

Meanwhile your country is built upon liberalism, secularism, and democracy. There is not one single component of Eastern influence in your government because it operates on a secular-liberal epistemology.

This is what many people tend to do, they will claim that they've retained their culture, cultural norms, and customs and that they haven't been Westernized at all while accepting every single ideology to have come out of the West as the best systems of governance.

You live in a society where everyone speaks Turkish, looks Turkish, and dresses Turkish but pro-democracy, pro-liberalism, and pro-secularism. If you are ideologically Western (Turkey is) then by definition you are Westernized.

Ataturk even chose the Latin alphabet for the language. I'm not saying that Turks should have kept the Arabic one, but you don't get to change from one foreign alphabet to another only to talk down to the one used prior *when* you don't ever use the original alphabet. If Turks truly wanted to be nationalist without any Western influence (and Arab cultural influence) then they would have used the original Orkhon alphabet instead of the Latin one which is clearly an attempt to become more associated with the West.

""But those ideologies *are* the best""

No, they aren't. They're extremely flawed and those who believe that the West's success is built off of its ideologies and not its conquest and subjugation of nations that continues on today is delusional and unaware of the historical truths surrounding this.

If you don't want to be Western then drop the democracy, liberalism, and secularism and either return to Tengriism or Islamic governance, drop the Latin alphabet, and revert to a traditional Turkish society in the form of a nation-state.

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it.

He was already in hot waters due to his rather long break and being carried away by her would be bad, especially given that he seemed to be of a higher rank than her courtesy of a lack of Justice coat on her end.

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening.

"gw72yjm","THE DYNAMICS OF THE FIVE

**The Direction of Disintegration: The Five Goes to Seven**

Starting at Level 4, Fives under stress will begin to exhibit many of the qualities of average to unhealthy Sevens. Average Fives tend to retreat from connection with others and from activities in the world which they fear they will be unable to accomplish. Thus they become increasingly narrow in their focus and concerns. The move to Seven can be seen as an unconscious reaction to this shrinking of the Five's world, albeit in the scattered, hyperactive discharge of anxiety found in the average to unhealthy Seven.

At Level 4, Fives are focusing their energies in studying, practicing, and preparing. They do not feel confident to enter the arena of life and believe that further developing their knowledge and skills will give them the protection they need to survive. Along with this, however, comes a desire for variety and a restlessness of mind characteristic of type Seven. Also like Sevens, Fives at this Level are constantly acquiring information, building their collections of music, books, and videos, or whatever else captures their interest. They move from one topic to another, looking for the subject that will satisfy them, for the project they can really get involved with. But in this state of restlessness, none of their pursuits are entirely satisfactory to them.

At Level 5, Fives have become even more preoccupied and involved with their projects and ideas. They are beginning to isolate themselves socially and to become more focused on their thoughts than on the world around them. Fives begin to be starved for stimulation, and under stress may begin to involve themselves with a wide variety of experiences which do not relate directly to their central projects or motivations. They distract themselves with video games, movies, and science fiction and horror novels. They love to let their minds free-associate, and can enjoy moments of silliness and offbeat humor which often surprise the people around them. Fives under stress may also develop a taste for nightlife, exploring restaurants, bars, and nightclubs—often as voyeurs. They will usually be secretive about this, however, and few of their friends will be aware of this aspect of their lives. As their anxiety escalates, so does their desire for distraction and stimulation.

At Level 6, Fives are becoming more fearful, and despair of ever finding a niche for themselves. They become threatened by most interactions with others and can be antagonistic and provocative in defense of their intellectual or creative ""turf."" They get into high gear in their avoidance of anxiety, and can be insensitive and aggressive in their pursuit of whatever they want at the time. The jaded, calloused qualities of the Seven only reinforce the Five's growing cynicism, making them impatient with people and extremely hardened in their view of the world. Some may find them wild and exciting at this level, but most people are put off by their intense, bristling energy. Further, Fives under stress will not hesitate to use drugs or alcohol to quell their anxieties. They will pursue whatever offers them relief from their pain and fears, even if their escape is costly and short-lived.

At Level 7, unhealthy Fives are extremely isolated, cut off from contact with others and the world, and consequently have no constructive outlets for their inner intensity. When they go to Seven, they discharge this energy in a variety of escapist behaviors, which only makes them more dissipated and incapable. Unhealthy Fives lurch from an isolated, fearful state to one of wild activity. Their minds are beginning to run out of control, and when they can no longer contain their fear, this enormous mental turbulence gets acted out in impulsive and often irresponsible ways. They lunge into mindless activity, by which they succeed only in getting themselves into worse trouble and more serious conflicts with the environment. They are irrational, have extremely poor judgment, and make poor choices about which actions to take. When others question their self-destructive escapism, their responses can be abusive and infantile.

At Level 8, Fives are full of terrors and cannot distinguish the horrific images that erupt from their unconscious from reality. Under increased stress, their behavior becomes manic and reckless. Moving to Seven now, deteriorated Fives go totally out of control. Some of the terrible things they have feared may actually happen as a result of their erratic and irresponsible behavior. And as fearful as Fives have become, they are often heedless and unaware of real dangers. For example, they may be killed—not because they are devoured by their furniture or exposed to death rays from their television, but because, not watching where they are going, they get run over by a truck. Out-of-control Fives are reckless and accident-prone: they may be poisoned, not by the KGB but because they mistakenly ate something they should not have. Neurotic Fives need to reestablish contact with reality (particularly the positive aspects of it), although at this Level they are completely incapable of doing so. They act impulsively, erratically, and hysterically, like a manic-depressive Seven, becoming increasingly unstable and unpredictable. 

At Level 9, Fives are consumed with terror and are desperate to escape the horrors they perceive around them. Similarly, they cannot find anything in themselves which inspires confidence or gives them any sense that they will be able to cope with the rest of their lives. Fearing that they have reached some sort of horrible dead end, they may compulsively do permanent harm to themselves or someone else. Even if they do not kill themselves, their reckless activities may well have severely damaged their health and limited their ability to pursue any further activities. Like unhealthy Sevens, they are debilitated, burned-out, and paralyzed with fear. As anxiety reaches an ever new pitch, they may do something irrevocable, such as impulsively killing someone or committing suicide.

**The Direction of Integration: The Five Goes to Eight**

Fives typically do not feel that they know enough to act: there is always more to know. They will always feel insecure until they have mastered the real world and are not simply masters of their own minds. From a psychoanalytic point of view, their egos are typically too weak for the ids—their aggressions and other impulses tend to overpower their minds.

This no longer happens to healthy, integrating Fives because they have incorporated their perceptions of the world into themselves by identifying with them instead of merely observing them. They no longer identify just with their thoughts, but also with the objects of their thoughts. Thus, integrating Fives have overcome their fear of the environment and are learning to trust it. Hence their self-confidence grows, after the manner of healthy Eights.

When they go to Eight, Fives also realize that, as little as they think they know, it is still more than almost anyone else. They also realize that they do not have to know absolutely everything before they can act. They will learn more as they do more; they will be able to solve new problems as they arise. They understand that they will know what they need to know when they need to know it. Their confidence will come not from some collection of skills or some vast body of information that they have memorized, but from a real connection with their presence in the world. They then experience themselves not as separate from the world, not as a helpless speck, but as a powerful, integral part of it.

Integrating Fives act from a realization of their own genuine mastery. While they do not know everything, they know enough to lead others with confidence. The correctness of their ideas has been so well confirmed by reality that they no longer fear acting. They acquire the courage it takes to put their ideas, and consequently themselves, on the line. Thus, integrating Fives realize that they are able to contribute something worthwhile to others. As a result, their thoughts are finally given expression in action and possibly in leadership. Integrating Fives show others how to do what only they know how to do. And, as we have seen, the practical value of their ideas may be incalculable.",1619631460,"and as fearful as fives have become, they are often heedless and unaware of real dangers.","heedless and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"often heedless and unaware","heedless",NA,"often",0

I mean really the end of the battle didn t feel natural at all, that awesome ninja that mocked Hidan for not being able to make the difference betwen the real and the clone got caught off guard because of the clones.. also rasen shuriken takes quite some time to charge, why was Kakuzo just watching Naruto..
So this is how Naruto vs Kakuzo was for me :
K : Omg he s charging some incredible technique, i can't be hit by that. 
N : fails
K : Ok, his team helped him, oh look he s charging that again, this time I surely won t be hit.
K - get s hit.
 So why didn t he try to stop Naruto while he was charging rasen shurkien, and no it can t be because he was aware of the others, he could just send one of his hands or spit some fire on Naruto. He also attacked Naruto second time completely reckless and unaware of the others, he was way clever than that, even Shikamaru said a few episodes back that he is clever and he won't make a move without knowing what is facing. 
 Also how could Naruto make a rasen shuriken mid air and how tf did Kakuzo didn t manage to avoid that hit when he was 1/1 at speed wih Kakashi.. came from behind? No, it was a raging kid with a extremely loud technique, it would have been easy task for him to avoid that.

"gvcn816","Attempting to legislate morality has never worked and always has other ""unintended"" consequences (I put unintended in parentheses because the mass incarceration rates for the urban poor and minorities for drug crimes was very much a desired outcome of the so called ""war on drugs""). The negative outcomes of the criminalization of most narcotics such as the separation of families, the violent nature of black markets created by the demand for illegal drugs, the invasion of privacy and disregard for constitutional rights inherit in policing drug use, the generational mistrust and fear of police and the federal government and the complete disregard for any studies or evidence that is contradictory to the accepted view of drug use to name a few far outweigh any perceived benefits of the current laws. 

I would also like to address the OP's mistaken statement that ""hard"" drugs such as cocaine and heroin have no ""legitimate"" or medical use which is simply incorrect...cocaine is a schedule II drug meaning it has recognized medicinal value and is still used in certain circumstances by medical professionals to this day and while heroin itself is not used to treat pain many of the most effective and proscribed painkillers and anesthetics are opioids derived from the same plant as synthetic heroin. I point this out to show how the general public is very misinformed and unaware of the very complicated reality and history of the human consumption of narcotic substances.

Regardless as a topic of discussion within the classical liberal view the only thing that really matters is how the ""war on drugs"" and the criminalization of drug use effects the liberty and dignity of the individual and on this point the answer seems to me to be very clear...it is paternalistic and a violation of the basic human right to self ownership to dictate what substances a person may choose to put in their own bodies. This is a fundamental right that must be respected within any understanding of classical liberalism...anything less is antithetical to the sovereignty of the individual.",1619028605,"i point this out to show how the general public is very misinformed and unaware of the very complicated reality and history of the human consumption of narcotic substances.","misinformed and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"very misinformed and unaware","misinformed",NA,"very",0

Children and women  are then treated as a commodity to be sold and used for their programmed purposes. 

A police detective back in the 90s had been seeing an unexplained explosion of cults forming, and put together a document detailing how these cults have been operating. Included was a detailed description on how the mind control method worked,

The testimony from the OJP report lines up perfectly with Hammonds Greenbaum Speech (https://www.empty-memories.nl/science/greenbaum.pdf), and reiterates that there is a major cult problem across each city in America. 

In my locality alone, there are multiple reports of cult activity spanning decades, most of them never made major headlines, save the one that inspired True Detective. 

Why do all the writers of modern media seem to be so well versed and initiated in the Mystery Schools? How is this knowledge so widespread when there is no obvious place to learn it available to the public? What do Cults like “The Finders” want with Children, why do they keep appearing, and how are these groups so similar in their success? Why do they all operate exactly the same, with a focus on Kidnapping children? 

They all seem to run on Masonic styled rules and laws, with degrees of initiation, ritual, meditation, and sacrifice. The body of the congregation is usually unaware of the true dealings, while the head honcho always seems to have everyone and everything under control. 

This system pops up so often, that I’m starting to suspect that these Charismatic Cult leaders are agents of a larger institution. Often we hear of ties to major names with these people. NXIVM was majorly connected to the richest echelons of the world, and John of God was great friends with Oprah. Even Charles Manson wrote music for The Beach Boys. 

These guys are likely sent out by someone, to read from a script and set up a commune for some purpose. Why? I don’t know, but this thought always stays with me,

With the NSA having access to all the data on the planet, and the military funded beyond comprehension, they say that we’ve had the resources to end  the war on Drugs, Terror, and So on, in one year. 

And yet, we know now that these Gov agencies actually control and started things like the Drug problem, and even profit off it. What’s to say that we don’t do the same on the more profitable venture with Humans?",1618880908,"people like john of god, and keith reniere, who’s mission it is to gather a devoted following, whom are completely brainwashed and unaware of the founders goals.","brainwashed and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely brainwashed and unaware","brainwashed",NA,"completely",0

"gv1biaa","I agree 100% with everything you said and just wanted to piggyback onto it the ""13 steppers"". For those unfamiliar with AA/NA, there's 12 steps to recovery that they follow. Sometimes. Personally, I really didn't understand,  because at the time I was younger (16 years old), and would see certain people while going around the room during introductions, have a changed sobriety date. Each week. Sometimes both meetings in one week. Which kinda seems like they're not working the program or at the very least taking the program, as seriously as others. When you're a young 16 year old woman who's been using for 4 years and has already been through inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities for drug addiction, yet is still using, this is confusing at first witnessed. Then, when the meeting ends and the majority of the women there are side eyeing you and low key avoiding you, while the men are wayyy to friendly, understanding and eager to help.... yeah it puts a bad taste in your mouth. The 13 steppers are the people, males and females, who prey on the new comers and take advantage of their vulnerable state for their beneficiary gain. Usually it's replacing one addiction for another and I'm not talking about them recommending a great gym to work out at. I'm talking about them working you and us addicts, active/clean/white knuckle sobriety/actually sober are excellent manipulators. 
Also, I remember the 1st sponsor I had. Now, giving her the benefit of the doubt that she was strictly an alcoholic and had no understanding or experience relating to drug abuse, she definitely should have never agreed to be my sponsor to begin with. At least during that time in my life, fresh outta rehab and floating on my little pink cloud, I truly wanted to achieve my life back and be sober and happy again. Instead I had a woman who 80% of the time would ignore my phone calls, if she did answer would tell me she was doing something and would call me back (never did) or would minimize my feelings. I was still going to high school, the same school I used at with the same people I skipped school to use with and the same ""friends"" who I would buy from. That's kinda important and I had achieved my 90 in 90, by myself with the guidance of my family as my support system and one other woman who saw and understood where/what I felt. Unfortunately though she hadn't had enough clean time to be a sponsor yet. When I shared my experience with my sponsor in a meeting one day, without straight up calling her out and humiliating her in front of everyone, she let me have it! She told me that I'm just a kid, have no idea what losing everything including people in your life to this disease (unbeknownst to her, I recently had lost a close friend who overdosed in his Ma's house and she found him along with his younger sister who was my younger brother's friend ... I also lost my family's trust and at that age, it's a huge thing to factor in. Along with self respect for myself because when you have no $$ to pick up, you better supply your dealer with something and I'm sure I don't need to explain that one any further) ... I was then told that I was too much for her to have to ""take on"" as she has numerous others who she sponsors prior to me. Wow! Did that really put into perspective what I thought of myself at that age and state of mind, as a confirmation that I don't matter not even to those who are supposed to be able to relate and carry on the message. 

After many years of screwing up, I finally became sober, without the assistance of AA/NA. I went to college and graduated with a 3.84 GPA, I worked with adolescents at the very same facility that I had once attended and I never ever pushed the whole follow up with your local AA/NA meetings, etc. I explained to them that you have to remember that what works for some may not for you and to try to get to the root of your reasoning behind your addiction. Don't beat yourself up or spiral back if you relapse and make sure that you find a good support system, preferably one that doesn't use themselves. 
Anyway, I'm sorry for the long reply but I just had to share my thoughts and opinions regarding my agreement with what you stated. I always felt like AA/NA meetings gave off like a cult type mindset vibe and it's a very selfish program. A little too selfish for myself. I'm not going to knock those who have benefited from the rooms because if so, I'm so happy &amp; proud of you. I'm simply saying that it's not the only alternative and it definitely can do more damage than good, especially when you're a newbie in the most vulnerable state possible and unaware of the types of people who you may meet on the otherside of those doors with intentions that rehabilitation centers don't exactly tell you about as they're pushing you out the door because your insurance company has stopped paying for your treatment there.",1618798129,"i'm simply saying that it's not the only alternative and it definitely can do more damage than good, especially when you're a newbie in the most vulnerable state possible and unaware of the types of people who you may meet on the otherside of those doors with intentions that rehabilitation centers don't exactly tell you about as they're pushing you out the door because your insurance company has stopped paying for your treatment there.","possible and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"possible and unaware","possible",NA,NA,0

"guy71ze","Not supportive or at least ignorant. I'm not saying this is the case with her, but straight people tend to 1.) Take their own straighteness for granted and 2.) Be hyper aware of and uncomfortable with explicit queerness. So they'll conveniently be unaware of all the ways heterosexuality is literally everywhere constantly (movies, tv, ads, conversation, assumptions) and only be aware of when queerness is present, and then they'll over exaggerate it. The basis of this is that they consciously or unconsciously view queerness as abnormal and straightness as normal. Because of this, they're unaware of how ubiquitous their sexual orientation actually is and how big of a deal society makes of it for them. Hence why you'll see people Twitter complaining about how tv shows have too many gay people or how queerness is being shoved in their face when there are like 20 straight characters and 3 queer ones. It makes no logical sense but they still see it that way. 

Straight people take their sexuality for granted and so they don't have to mention that they are straight or take it into account when navigating the world. The world considers heterosexuality the default, which is why when you search 'couples' on most image websites, 99% of them will be heterosexual and you have to explicitely search 'gay couples' to get actual gay people. So your mom gets to say that she's just a married woman because the world already assumes 'married woman' equals 'straight married women'. Non straight people don't get to depend on the fact that they are the default like your mom does, they have to explicitely express it. And then they get accused of caring too much or being too in your face about it. 

Next time your mom says this, remind her of the fact that she doesn't have to talk about her sexual orientation explicitely because her sexual orientation is considered the default, and everyone already assumes she is straight so she doesn't have to speak up and correct them. That most representations of women, in media, careers, the medical field, beauty, parenting, religion, literally everywhere, are directly catered toward her as a straight woman, so she can afford to be apathetic and unaware of it. If she lived in a world where being straight was the marginalized minority she would be far more aware and expressive of it. Also ask her to consider whether queerness is REALLY being shoved in her face or whether she has a double standard towards queer people that makes it so that she can he hyperaware of and bothered by queer people's expressions of their own sexuality. Straight people talk about their own sexuality everytime they mention having an opposite gender partner or talk about having children biologically. When they talk about finding the opposite gender attractive, dating the opposite gender, reading novels based around straight romance, assume their kids have crushes on the opposite gender, talk about character's who like the opposite gender, etc. But it is never seen as 'shoving' because they consider that normal and take it for granted.",1618733621,"that most representations of women, in media, careers, the medical field, beauty, parenting, religion, literally everywhere, are directly catered toward her as a straight woman, so she can afford to be apathetic and unaware of it.","apathetic and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"apathetic and unaware","apathetic",NA,NA,0

"guwom3y","Nope your eyebrows are really very naturally feminine in part because you have little or no brow ""bossing"" or ridges and thus no recessed or hooded eyes and a higher eyebrow. 

Your expression may be a bit blank for a photo. I can go blank too as I can't really pretend emotions naturally if ""posing"".

But I have found out that after transition my expressions became less of a ""monotone"" and I just opened up rather than trying to hide. I just seemed to become more expressive around others after transition. 

Even so some people think I am somehow amusing, though usually I am clueless why.

It is a bit of a mystery to me but I sometimes think that I may have mild asbergers spectrum condition. I especially tend to not really understand some sensitivities to medical and other topics - especially around mealtimes. I don't emotionally see any personal problem but I'm told others do. Some of this may mostly be non-socialization except as an adult after transitioning - truly a late bloomer.

If I offend you below please forgive me as I am prejudiced in favor of transitioning and would have done it sooner if my features were as nice as yours.

That said I think maybe you have something similar to myself in trying to sorta *hide* yourself in androgeny. (I lived there for years slowly changing and mainly waiting for electrology and Estrogen to make it easiest.) I still live there for the most part as I usually look mostly like a slightly butch lesbian (yep that's an accurate one).

I don't know for sure if you were really all that successful as a person in guyspace except in semi-convincing yourself. I say so because in your photos you seem more an androgynous underdeveloped young girl. 

I do understand if you are uncertain and very cautious about transition and changing your family relationships. I have no way of knowing your family but most of mine eventially came around at least grudgingly with time and my changes (I personally started hormones and electrolysis a while before disclosing my thoughts and feelings to them about transitioning FWIW.) I think you'll do fantastic if you do, despite any misgivings as you look much better now than most of us after doing so much more to change. 

I think afterwards (or maybe during) you'll find some people may have already thought that you might transition. I was personally totally clueless in high school why I was being called fag or faggot. I still sorta am clueless except that I was maybe giving feminine vibes but totally clueless and unaware of it. They got it wrong though, I still prefer girls.

Anyway, forgive me if I may have offended you for being too presumptuous and saying too much. I probably just miss talking to others on the web and then there is my asbergers spectrum thing about inappropriateness too which probably describes this long post.",1618697853,"i still sorta am clueless except that i was maybe giving feminine vibes but totally clueless and unaware of it.","clueless and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"totally clueless and unaware","clueless",NA,"totally",0

Yes, is bad and I had to learn by first hand: in many scenarios the best thing to do is shut up and let them destroy themselves with their own words. They're ignorant and unaware of stuff. They will do their best to make it look like you're wrong and they're always right. 

But I do believe it's best to let them trip and fall on their own. Understandable that sometimes this go over someone else's pride, but let them be wrong or get away with it (most of the times), be aware the game can't run forever, but you don't always need to bring justice to this world.

Still, I believe here you mentioned one exception to the rule, the kingdom of narcs: healthcare. This is tricky because the life and well being of someone is at stake. 

In my case, the (my) narc broke one big rule to get her way. 

She did it with me at her side and not someone else with more authority, that could put her back in place, but still, she tried to overrule the personal needs of someone OVER her own need of power and control over (literal) s\*\*t. 

For whatever reason, with me as a witness, she didn't want to bring someone to the toilet and asked them to ""just do it in the diaper"".

I had to stop her there, take charge for her complaints over my own *disruptive* actions (over *her command*) and the needs of this person. In the end I just told to the narc ""I can't do what you ask me to do, I take full responsibility over my own actions, I know what I'm doing, blame me to others if you like"".

I don't know how it went after that, I'm kind of curious to know if they hired or fired this narc. My bet is that she got hired and still works there.

I wish I could tell you more, that this narc is an idiot and got what she deserved, that I got a compliment for my job well done, but no. 

My only achievement is that the person in question managed to reach the toilet in time and do the deed where they should, alone, in peace. That's it. 

Patient first.

Disclaimer: I don't have a full-on healthcare education, but to be fair I don't think I need a master-degree in childcare to bring someone (who can walk, talk and sit and think of their own) to frick'n toilet.

"guuuaeg","When I was 20 and living at home with my parents I thought I could live/travel in Southeast Asia for several months. I booked myself a ticket and thought I'd be fine because I was cocky and thought I was better than everyone because of strong ""look at me!"" energy. Everyone else was going to college and I was like Taylor, going on my \*\~own\~\* journey (altho I've never been in an MLM so there's that...).  
It was so fucking hard. I emailed my mom every single day. I was sooo insecure with myself  and felt so minimized by other travelers around me because of how much happier they were (probably because they were traveling for fun, not to fill a void or prove something, like I was doing.) It's very difficult to transplant yourself to another country when you're doing it for the wrong reasons &amp; when you're so miserable with yourself. I genuinely thought if I physically placed myself on the other side of the world, I would magically be happier. But my insecurities came with and were magnetized the moment I stepped out of the airplane. 

Taylor has so much inner work to do and I genuinely hope that she becomes even slightly aware of how unhappy she is. If she decides to move to MX, she will be in for the shock of her life but I hope she powers through it. I wanted to come back early from Asia but I also had so much pride that I stayed and I think those last few weeks are when I started to come around and really begin to see myself for who I really was.

"gut0ae3","NTA. Have you ever heard of a psychological ploy for narcissists of a scapegoat and a golden child? It seems like a textbook case for you, and I would suggest you read everything you can about being the child of narcissists. You, sadly, seem to be the scapegoat. That was my role, too.

You need to get used to the idea that no one in your family will ever take your side. That doesn't mean you aren't behaving appropriately. You need to stop thinking your family as an excellent gauge of appropriate behavior. That is abundantly clear. 

The things you describe, especially the birthday stuff, about how you were always told that you and your needs were less than your sister are textbook narcissist manipulation. Don't get mad. It isn't personal. Just, your parents are broken and unaware of how bizarre their thinking is. Normal people would never consider half the crap you brought up here, let alone the stuff you're too scared to say.

The answer to your parents is, ""no."" That's all. You don't owe them an explanation because you are an adult and it is your money. The fact that they will make an effort to make their ""child"" feel bad to get what they want just says a great deal about their crazy, but nothing about you.

I would suggest you really take some time to read about others like you. I think it will be an eye opening experience to hear stories from others that sound so eerily like your own.

"gusmisg","regardless if you play casual mode, the objective of the game is to WIN. This is inherently competitive. You are supposed to not die, get kills, farm gold, get items, destroy towers, destroy the throne. You played a core character this game and had no items, probably very little kills, and probably died a lot. Relative to the other players in this game, you played badly.  


 Of course, people will always play badly. However, if you are consistently playing well below everyone else in the game, it should be your moral prerogative to, if you want to enjoy this competitive team game, improve your level through the options given to you by the game as others have pointed out. It is a reality in mobas that when you play badly, you negatively impact on your teammates ability to enjoy the game.   


Compare to a game of soccer, where if you are a bad goalie you might concede more goals, or if you are a bad striker, you might miss more ""easy"" goals, in dota, if you play badly, you make the enemy team relatively STRONGER to your team by giving them gold and exp. Imagine if you are playing soccer and everytime your new goalie concedes a goal the enemy team gets faster stronger and has better ball handling. It would cause a lot of frustration.  This is the inherent cause of teammate toxicity in mobas. When you play badly, you drastically make the game less enjoyable for your teammates. While toxicity in chat towards you should not be congratulated, it is the unfortunate reality of mobas.

So what do I think they deserve? Well as an anarchist, statist pigs are my enemy. But as a progressive - I wish them as much harm as they cause others. I wish the pigs that shoot innocent people get shot at, I wish those that abused others gets abused. Most officers would deserve atleast ""moderate"" punishment under this criteria.

&gt;your trying to disconnect these politicians and police and company owners from the general population, so you can dehumanize them because if you convince yourself that they aren't human then you cant become as bad as they are, meaning you don't have to confront that part of yourself that is capable of commiting these atrocity's

No. Dead wrong. You have a trait that I find dreadful in people. You try to assume things about the way others think. Humans have developed a complex psychology - trying to use the logic you naturally go by to predict others who go by their own logic will never ever be 100% effective. You will never fully be able to know someone else simply because of the sheer astronomical complexity of the human psyche.

HOWEVER

I am aware that authority positions attract people with specific traits, its not that im projecting these traits onto them. Positions of power, and hierarchal structures of people will always attract the greediest of mankind. The kind of people willing to steal others prosperity and watch them all suffer. This is statistically evident, im somewhat confident you know this and I dont have to pull up a source, but I will if you ask. 

You might call me crazy but i dont think most people are willing to face the full effect of their destruction. Even if you have a shred of empathy, the weight of your sins would crush you. The only way to counter that is immense greed. Greed much more powerful than your empathy. I dont think most people could deal with the fact they are the reason 1 person is dead. Let alone hundreds, or hundreds of thousands. Or being part of the reason people are in poverty - without being also immensly greedy.



&gt;even though they are in fact human and you are also human, meaning you and I and EVERYONE is capable of doing them. if we ignore that part of ourselves we can, instead of grappling with this reality and working on ourselves to have unerodable morals to prevent us from becoming the vary thang we hate, which is too often the case.

"gtsas45","#  THRIVE, MLM, My Experience, Disgust for Those That Dream? Murderer(s?), My opinion.... 

I think I have some perspective on this topic. I can’t understand why people are so judgmental and emotional about Thrive and MLMs  in general. Can’t wrap my head around it.  MLMs are predatory for the most part- one of the reasons is that the ""employees"" who market, sell and to some degree brand the product are virtually unregulated and often time unqualified to make any profit more than once. However, IF a service or product that is marketed and distributed through an MLM structure is presented by a knowledgeable rep who is willing to respond honestly to questions AND admit when they don't have the answer then find the real answer for a potential customer... THEN the MLM itself is serving its purpose: to provide a platform to market their product (your pitch, testimony, social media post or email etc), a means of continually feeding the prospective customer pool (your social media and natural connections in life), and a system of product delivery (your product for samples and “parties”, your “website”, mail-order through you). No hard there, right? Few but some MLM brand offer quality products that are effective and or enjoyable. 

In my opinion. 

Even if all MLMs are pure evil, let’s just say they are, it is curious that so many people express distain and disgust, emotions that are generally reserved for rapists, murderers, ego-centric, a-holes and certain in-laws, for people that find themselves drawn into the illusion MLMs have nearly perfected over the past 50 years that proposes then promises an ideal, satisfying career, better health or a more comfortable lifestyle. Why is this so… terrible? Why should we be disgusted by a person inspired by decent career and life goals companies like le-vel provide and then mark with a sales figure bullseye “consultants” are repeatedly told they CAN and WILL reach? What is strongly communicated in that message but not explicitly stated is “if you aren’t successful with us, there’s something wrong with YOU”.

I myself got involved with 3 MLMs over the past 14 years ranging from offering total BS products to offering high quality products by nearly anyone's standards AND transparency in product formulation and business structure and compensation plan. Not all MLMs are the same. The first I got into was high pressure, unrealistic sales pitch scripts reps were ordered to repeat by making 100 calls a day. The company still exists. It’s a scam for sure. Everyone that hangs around for more than 6 months finds this out. Lots of suckers in this MLM’s wake. 

The second was a niche product line and it was fine and your potential ""in the company was oversold"", but what new recruits are told is no different than what your ""upline"", your boss and others you may need to answer to in any company, would tell you when you start the job. Companies want new employees (or consultants) to be invested in the company’s mission and success. All successful (and unsuccessful) companies want their employees -at all levels- to be excited and committed to doing a good job in their role in the organization. So this second MLM offered an OK product and the founders and a couple other’s in the company were way to jazzed about. Fine. No reason for distain or disgust. 

The third MLM I ""did"", I figured somethings out. I liked the product a lot and did my research for 10 months to be exact. Leading up to my dive into this MLM, I was substitute teaching with this idea of deciding if I REALLY wanted to go back to school as a single mother to earn my Master’s Degree to become a Special Education Teacher. I had a history of starting big things and not completing them. (Is this a hallmark of typical MLM enthusiasts? I’m asking.) I decided to try this MLM out full on while subbing. I made the decision and  I did it 100% (the MLM and I earned that Master’s Degree and best job ever as a teacher). I can report that as a consultant in this MLM  I made  darn good money. I made enough to pay for my first year of grad school! I made very good money for exactly 4 months. And then I left the MLM pyramid. By design. If I stayed on and did as well as I did in month 3 when I got to month 5, 6, 7 and on… my monthly net income would have decrease by 400%.  Prior to enrolling, prior to getting onboarded, prior to the team calls and trainings and purchasing a $200 consultant kit and an $800 “fast track to manager package” I could see that this company's commission structure was HEAVILY front loaded to reward “consultants” who were ready and willing to jump into business buildin  knees first. The commission plan immediately rewarded eager entrepreneurs with money in hand. Fast trackers with money to hand-over in exchange for product. Product for prospective clients to sample, more product to use myself so I could “sell it”, and more product… enough product to throw a ""party"", to throw MANY parties filled with friends trying my stuff and… the limited front-loaded commission plan quickly rewarded newbies willing to sign-up everyone they know within the first month. I made sure I could do the things the seemingly generous commission plan required of me and I made damn sure I would do them. I did the things.  And I made good money. And I swore I would gracefully say ""later"" after 4 months. I did that too. I had to really. 

Unless I fancied myself as being one of the statistically improbable and nearly impossible .00002% of motivated new ""consultants"" who would earn a 6 figure income pedaling the product, I had to close shop 4 months in. 

I personally believe that something like what I finally did, the third time around, is the only way a new consultant will make a real profit (not gross profit). The vast majority of inspired consultants end up being suckered. 

Next disclosure, I tried Thrive. The whole experience. I still use a DFT and Boost (has lots of greens) and one of the hydration drinks that contains potassium that I personally need to take in some absorbable form for health reasons. I think the products are effective in supplementing nutrients my body needs and THRIVES on... but that's MY body. Not everyone's body will have this experience. This is important: Recommending one blanket nutritional program and energy supplement for everyone is dangerous and irresponsible. 

Just my opinion. 

Whatever my opinion may be, to blame Thrive supplement's ingredients for any of the dysfunction and psychopathology that exists in the Watt's story is kind of ridiculous unless you are willing to conduct the research needed to validate such a claim… and still it’s kind of a ridiculous hypothesis to attempt to prove. Anyone can say anything, literally anything about any product, any person, any mom doing her best and still screwing up at times. Like we all do in life… over and over again. We do the wrong things, we say the worng things and it’s freaking hard. At some point we learn life’s lessons, if we are lucky, and we do more right things and say less crewed up words. Hopefully. There are many words folks tend to say about the Watt's murders. There are many words said that are by nature not allowed all at once. The words are still said. There are many words said about Shanann and her life and Thrive. To my ears, those words frequently sound cracking and lacking and uninformed and unaware of how gross they sound to others. Those words that people keep say about the Watts and a mother and a young woman trying to find her best self are as arbitrary and nonsensical as feeling distain and disgust for a person doing the “MLM thing”. It makes no sense to have disdain and disgust for a person with inspiration that was sparked as they listened to the script an MLM spun for anyone listening. MLMs spend the lion's share of their money perfecting a nicely packaged promise that can sound like a promise made to you that assures your future will be made of the dreams you've held for yourself for a lifetime ... because you sell their shit their way.",1617868952,"to my ears, those words frequently sound cracking and lacking and uninformed and unaware of how gross they sound to others.","uninformed and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"uninformed and unaware","uninformed",NA,NA,0

All types have emotions and have Fi. The issue with ENTPs like me is that, because we're so detached and unaware of our emotions, we run away and skimp our negative emotions and do not process them. As result, over time those negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, hate or whatever build up until it's too much and starts overwhelming us. And even at that point, we still try to run away from it. Resulting in a very unhealthy ENTP

"gtlp8zf","&gt;Its a rather interesting philosophy though it seems like there is no such thing as forgery if you don't recognize the original as property to begin with. 

No because **the original is a physical thing modified by a specific person**, and a forgery is a copy of an original intended to fool people into believing it originated from that person.

Copying though, in itself is not necessarily forgery if it is not passed off as having been created by that person. And a person may make several copies of their own work but no one would say they are forging their own work.

&gt;I personally feel like there are too many logical loose ends this far down the path.

There are actually more problems in copyrights and patents, and not to mention the difficulty of enforcing them in a modern age where copying things is extremely easy and hard to track.

One problem for example, two people were developing Calculus independent and unaware of each other, such things are possible because ideas and information are not physically bound and exist in their own landscape.

"gtdacm7"," Na última semana, eu e minha esposa discutimos fazer uma pequena renovação de cenário aqui em casa. Há um ano participando de conferências e reuniões online, decidimos por mudar o cenário nas paredes. Compramos alguns rolos de papel de parede e painel com paisagem.

 A princípio, assisti a alguns vídeos no Youtube e logo conclui, eu posso fazer isso. Entretanto, decidimos por contratar um especialista para fazer a instalação.

 Durante a aplicação, o instalador – Adilson – ainda me questionou. “Você não olhou o Youtube e tentou fazer”? Abri um sorriso surpreso e confessei que se não fosse pela minha esposa, teria eu mesmo feito.

 Ao ver a instalação ao vivo e todo o material utilizado, entendi que se eu tivesse tentado, apenas por sorte, teria conseguido realizar o trabalho com a mesma qualidade, no mesmo tempo e com o mesmo material. Os rolos de papel foram a conta exata e tudo foi realizado em uma manhã sem desperdício ou acidente.

 Muitos quando iniciam seus investimentos, fazem o mesmo. Assistem a alguns vídeos nas mídias sociais e, como eu com o papel de parede, logo concluem, [eu posso fazer isso](https://degraoemgrao.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/03/10/se-deseja-parar-de-trabalhar-para-viver-disso-pense-duas-vezes/).

 Muito antes de mim, dois pesquisadores já perceberam esta ilusão que carregamos. David Dunning e Justin Kruger concluíram que quanto menos sabemos, mais acreditamos que somos especialistas.

 Conhecido como **efeito Dunning-Kruger**, o fenômeno foi publicado em 1999 no trabalho dos mesmos autores com o título “Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments” (Inábil e inconsciente disso: como as dificuldades em reconhecer sua própria incompetência o levam a superestimar suas habilidades).

 Curiosamente, o estudo teve como ponto de partida o fracassado roubo ao banco de McArthur Wheeler em 1995 nos EUA. Espantosamente, Wheeler não usou qualquer máscara para cobrir o rosto durante os dois assaltos que cometeu e foi preso uma hora depois. Ele estava incrédulo sobre como os investigadores chegaram até ele. Para ele, o fato de cobrir o rosto com suco de limão, o deixava invisível às câmeras.

 Segundo Dunning e Kruger:  
 “…when people are incompetent in the strategies they adopt to achieve success and satisfaction, they suffer a dual burden: Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it” (quando as pessoas são incompetentes nas estratégias que adotam para alcançar o sucesso e a satisfação, elas sofrem um duplo fardo: não apenas chegam a conclusões errôneas e fazem escolhas infelizes, mas sua incompetência lhes rouba a capacidade de realizá-lo).

 Em investimentos, é comum ver pessoas que acabaram de iniciar os investimentos e já acreditam serem capazes de elas próprias fazerem a gestão de carteiras de investimentos com ações e derivativos. Vídeos nas mídias sociais os levam a acreditar que podem viver de renda apenas fazendo [*day trade*](https://degraoemgrao.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/03/10/se-deseja-parar-de-trabalhar-para-viver-disso-pense-duas-vezes/) ou [*swing trade*](https://degraoemgrao.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/03/17/revelado-o-segredo-do-segundo-milhao-de-bettina/) com uma estratégia “infalível”.

 Com certeza você já ouviu falar de estudos que mostram como a maioria dos [gestores profissionais](https://degraoemgrao.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2017/10/03/voce-tambem-caiu-no-vies-do-otimismo/) perdem de índices de referência como o Ibovespa ou o CDI. Muitos sabem destas estatísticas, mas ainda acreditam que eles próprios conseguem fazer o que equipes com mais informação e experiência têm dificuldade.

 Comprar ações é muito simples. Acredito que é ainda mais simples que instalar papel de parede. No entanto, montar uma carteira com rentabilidade maior que o índice e com menor risco não é fácil.

 Não quero dizer que você não possa escolher os ativos que vão compor sua carteira, mas cuidado para não ser mais uma estatística dos pesquisadores Dunning e Kruger.

**TL;DR**\- Due to how many changes would be caused by the movement of the Stones and interactions caused in the attempts thereof, when Steve goes to return the Stones and doesn't come back via Pym-Particles, there's *no way* he could have come back ""the long way"". Therefore, whoever ""Old Man Steve"" or ""Roger Stevenson"" is, it is ***not*** the Captain America we and the Avengers know and love:

 **imposterogers**

if marvel revealed that steve rogers was actually stuck in the quantum realm it would legitimately be one of the most unsettling plot twists they could manage like not only would it mean that old steve is not steve at all, rather someone or *something* else, but it would also imply that steve didn’t finish his mission and return all the stones &amp; that the very fabric of reality is in danger

**imposterogers**

the thing about this is that the reveal would be absolutely bonkers and hit SO hard no matter how they did it bc not only would the audience would have the immediate and sinking understanding that they were wrong and unaware of the severity of the situation But they’d also have to watch as the rest of the characters continued day to day life w/o any suspicious while an imposter lived among them, reality begins to falter, and the real steve is stuck somewhere

while I’m at it .... possible ways they could reveal it

1. a scene with old steve interacting w sam and bucky immediately followed by a shot of Vormir that gradually zooms in on a man (steve) dancing alone on the cliff w a blank expression

2. old steve makes a huge mistake and answers a question or does something that we the audience know is 1000% ooc to the extreme but no one else notices

3. someone DOES realize old steve is an imposter but old steve realizes they figured it out .... and then we find out just how dangerous “old steve” is

**imposterogers**

how it could fit into the mcu :

\-falcon &amp; the winter soldier proceeds as normal. there’s no hints that’s something wrong. the Very last scene of the series is the dramatic reveal (to the audience only) that old steve is *not* steve rogers

\-this is not immediately touched upon again. there is no easy fix or instant solution. rather, in the shows &amp; movies, there seems to be something off. events and characters exist that shouldn’t &amp; others disappear. reality is beginning to decay.

\-wanda &amp; vision is a result of this: they are forced into an alternative reality (the 50s)

\-loki (who travels interdimensionally) begins to notice the signs and the danger the ENTIRE multiverse is in, and alternates between causing mischief and trying to bandage the holes in reality back together

\-enter dr strange. maybe it’s bucky who alerts him, fearful of what has been posing as “steve” &amp; what happened to the real one. or loki, who “wouldn’t be here unless it was important”. or wanda or or or. but then his film is a direct response to this growing problem within the mcu. the unraveling of reality. the invasion of whatever is trying to cause it. it’s a battle against time, as his memories and abilities begin to fade away. it’s him finding the real steve, wherever he may be, and whoever did this to him.",1617519545,"therefore, whoever ""old man steve"" or ""roger stevenson"" is, it is ***not*** the captain america we and the avengers know and love:  &amp;#x200b;   **imposterogers**  if marvel revealed that steve rogers was actually stuck in the quantum realm it would legitimately be one of the most unsettling plot twists they could manage like not only would it mean that old steve is not steve at all, rather someone or *something* else, but it would also imply that steve didn’t finish his mission and return all the stones &amp; that the very fabric of reality is in danger  **imposterogers**  the thing about this is that the reveal would be absolutely bonkers and hit so hard no matter how they did it bc not only would the audience would have the immediate and sinking understanding that they were wrong and unaware of the severity of the situation but they’d also have to watch as the rest of the characters continued day to day life w/o any suspicious while an imposter lived among them, reality begins to falter, and the real steve is stuck somewhere  while i’m at it .... possible ways they could reveal it  1. a scene with old steve interacting w sam and bucky immediately followed by a shot of vormir that gradually zooms in on a man (steve) dancing alone on the cliff w a blank expression  2. old steve makes a huge mistake and answers a question or does something that we the audience know is 1000% ooc to the extreme but no one else notices  3. someone does realize old steve is an imposter but old steve realizes they figured it out .... and then we find out just how dangerous “old steve” is  **imposterogers**  how it could fit into the mcu :  \-falcon &amp; the winter soldier proceeds as normal. there’s no hints that’s something wrong. the very last scene of the series is the dramatic reveal (to the audience only) that old steve is *not* steve rogers  \-this is not immediately touched upon again. there is no easy fix or instant solution. rather, in the shows &amp; movies, there seems to be something off. events and characters exist that shouldn’t &amp; others disappear. reality is beginning to decay.  \-wanda &amp; vision is a result of this: they are forced into an alternative reality (the 50s)  \-loki (who travels interdimensionally) begins to notice the signs and the danger the entire multiverse is in, and alternates between causing mischief and trying to bandage the holes in reality back together  \-enter dr strange. maybe it’s bucky who alerts him, fearful of what has been posing as “steve” &amp; what happened to the real one. or loki, who “wouldn’t be here unless it was important”. or wanda or or or. but then his film is a direct response to this growing problem within the mcu. the unraveling of reality. the invasion of whatever is trying to cause it. it’s a battle against time, as his memories and abilities begin to fade away. it’s him finding the real steve, wherever he may be, and whoever did this to him.","wrong and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"wrong and unaware","wrong",NA,NA,0

"gta7t19","There's a part of you called your body, it has one main desire. Your body simply wants to not die.

You develop a very elaborate survival strategy in order to make sure that you don't die. Before you right before you die you will start to feel bad, or look bad or you'll become unwise and unaware of something. So your body's figured out that it's really good to feel good, look good and be wise and aware.

But aside from simply wanting to not die, there's a part of you that wants to experience all of the wonderful things that life has to offer. Specifically, this other part of you wants to experience the freedom to cause and create the experience of love, peace and joy for others and yourself.

The issue is, your body's desire to make sure it doesn't die can work against your other desires to really enjoy life. The easiest example to see is that you cannot be really mad and angry at the same time you're being peaceful and filled with joy.

God knew this about people. And so one of the things that he did was he gave us away to become really good at living a life filled with love peace and joy. And become really good at making the body take a backseat to our desires that mean the most to us.

Because some people are bothered when they hurt other people, or bothered when they make really bad mistakes, or bothered because they really just don't like who they are anymore... God gave us a way to let past events stay in the past. It's called forgiveness. 

If you can forgive yourself and those around you for all the crap that's happened in your past, it gives you an opportunity to start to walk into a future that's filled with the love peace and joy that we all desire.

Walking into this future, requires believing that it's possible that you walk into a future filled with love peace and joy. Cuz obviously, if you don't believe it's possible you're not going to be able to do anything about it. And believing that it's possible to walk into a meaningful future is what faith is all about. And Faith here simply means doing something that you think is possible.

Christianity is all about setting up structures so that everything that I just listed can be practiced, learned and walked in successfully. And, as with all things when humans get involved, sometimes you'll find pockets of great success and you'll find pockets of miserable failures within Christianity itself. But that is the nature of what it is to be human.

&gt;And an after life it makes no sense you're dead how can you still live on to do things?

What you're referring to, would be like and unto how a Christian would de-emphasize our natural desire to want to not die, so that we can emphasize our spirits desire to experience love peace and joy. The way we say it in Christian terms is this...

""It is no longer I that live, but Christ that lives within me.""

It is no longer my body that's going to rule over my life, but it is Christ's desire that I live a life filled with love peace and joy...

"gt1wor1"," Before I give my advice I want to let you know that you're not alone. I've been here too before in the past. It took me meeting my partner to realize that all of this stuff was in my control. No one outside of myself controls my actions or reactions. I have much love for you and I know that if I can fix all this kind of stuff then so can you....now on to the advice &lt;3

Most people have a list of things to fix in their homes.

**So why do so few have a list of things to fix in their life?**

Because they're not intimate &amp; attentive with their life, the way they are with their house.

Understand that just like a home, your life has never-ending renovations that can be made. And more importantly... it likely has issues that need to be resolved, ASAP.

In a home, these issues are obvious because we live in our house, and interact with all parts of it often. In your life, these things are obvious as well-- but only if you're doing the daily work. Only if you're deeply involved with improving your life. Only if you interact with all parts of your life often.

**That means you can't ignore nutrition, mental health, or your feelings Or mistreat your husband. Or fail to set boundaries with kids. You need to be interacting with all these areas, regularly.**

In a house, if you never go near the kitchen, you won't know the fridge stopped working until the food rots. In life, if you never improve your beliefs, you won't know if your mood is causing problems, or your environment, or what until life gets even worse.

If you don't have a home remodeling list, you'll live in a broken-down, ramshackle place for years to come. And if you don't have a life remodeling list, you'll live in a terrible cluster-f\*\*k life.

**So pay attention to your life and write down a list of things to ""remodel"" about it.**

If you write down the list correctly you'll have hundreds of things to work on. Do not get overwhelmed. This is a blessing!  
It means you have a lot of freedom of choice. You have an abundance of options. You can wake up and work on a few easy ones today.

Like switching to half a bagel for breakfast. Or putting your child on their own for ten more minutes.  
Easy, gentle improvements. But you have access to them because they were somewhere in your list of hundreds.

Or you have the freedom to wake up and tackle a ""big one"". Like setting up a whole gym schedule. Or going to couples therapy.

The point is, all of us, myself included still, have many things we'd like to improve in our lives. The ones who feel good are the ones who are making real, lasting, permanent, improvements, bit by bit, day by day. The ones who feel good are the ones who take an honest look at themselves and improve whatever we can from our list of frustrations, one by one. With a calm, loving approach.

The people who feel like crap are the ones who refuse to make a list, refuse to work on at least one thing a day, and choose to stay stuck and unaware of their momentum.

I know you can do it. It just takes the commitment and practice to improve yourself. I believe in you. Wishing you much joy and success.

The idea of someone going to the doctor, finding out they're three months pregnant, then being told there's no possible way to get out of it, sounds horrifying... but if there has to be a middle ground, I'd say that's the softest one.

"gt0lod2","If he is already attracted to you there isn't anything you need to do to tease him. Trust me, he is always aware of your presence, what you are wearing, the scent of any perfume you use and so on. He will be teased just by seeing you.

However, you can stimulate him ""accidentally"", by which I mean on purpose in a way that appears to be an accidental. You can leave one button of your blouse open as if you missed buttoning it when getting dressed. Or like it just came undone on its own. You can drop something on the floor in front of him and bend down to pick it up. This does not have to be obvious, like in porn. Any movements you make that are somewhat out of the ordinary will catch his eye and trigger his imagination.

I once had a friend at work stop by my desk and crouch down to remove something from a briefcase or bag. I can't remember if she had missed a button or if she was just wearing a loose fitting summer top. But from my sitting position I could see almost her entire chest and stomach. She had on a cute lace bra, I recall that much. I was very turned on but she seemed unaware of what she was showing or what I was thinking. You can tease your boss with that kind of ""accident"".

If he sees you leaving the bathroom buttoning up your top or looking a bit flushed, he'll wonder if you were touching yourself. Same thing if he sees your hand in your lap but his view of what you might be touching is blocked. Keep his mind occupied with you. ""Was she pinching her nipple just now or absentmindedly adjusting her blouse?"" ""Is it my imagination or did she just look at my bulge and lick her lips?"" ""No panty lines? No sign of a bra strap across her back? Is she not wearing any underwear today?"" Things like that.

Here in the US you would have to be careful to not appear to be trying to tease him. Your business culture might be different, but you do not want to force him to reprimand you again. He may be required to report you to his superiors if he thinks you are breaking the rules. Therefore, you have to coax him into crossing that line first. Let him say the wrong thing or act in an inappropriate way before you do. At least here that would give you a legal advantage if the situation ever reached that point. But as I said, it might work differently over there.

No matter what though, always turn down his advances. What I'm suggesting is for you to make him confused, anxious and frustrated. You want him to think about you day and night, but never know for sure if you're trying to seduce him or just very sexy and unaware of your effect on him. Leaving him guessing will drive him crazy.

"gsuhltn","UPDATE MESSAGE FROM ME, MOE UNZ: I have always been honest with you, our beloved fans and customers. Other lesser snus shops would have remained quiet but the SnusCentral community deserves more. Now that the situation is contained, I want to present the facts and sincerely apologize.

The vast majority of you were unaffected and unaware of what I am about to tell you. No orders placed since late last week are affected.

For those who were affected, two weeks ago or so, SnusCentral was performing a massive backend software upgrade and one of our servers crashed during the process. (This was NOT the fault of me, Moe Unz, BTW).

The server crashing during the upgrade took out our Customer Service and Order Processing ability. Almost every system affected has been back up and running (for the most part) for a little over a week BUT had resulted in a backlog of 90 orders from back then and Customer Service being overwhelmed with emails they were unable to respond to.

The backlogged orders should already have been shipped; current orders are unaffected. Customer Service is prioritizing the email backlog and is responding as quickly as possible. If you haven't received a reply or your order yet, it is not because you are being ignored. (Just to repeat, I Moe Unz had nothing to do this. I was in HR training that week).

When I discover why the server failed and which vendor was responsible, I will travel to their offices and beat them with my broom on both of our behalves.

We are more sorry than I can express in English for the inconvenience and our IT Team has been and is continuing to work around the clock to get everything working like clockwork again.

Customer service is continuing to work through the email backlog as their systems come back online. Order Processing &amp; Shipping has been back online. We have brought in additional support from our other websites to manually check the new code for bugs and help out processing orders. Please bear with us!

"gss60hq","I was young and unaware of going into the step parent life and my step girls were 2 at the time. 

I learned a lot from talking to my own step parents and how they felt and dealt with being the ""outside adult"". 
The advice they gave me was to always respect that when anything big needs to be decided for the girls its never my job to make said decisions, it's their parents job. If you are asked your opinion you can give it but you  cannot be offended if they decide otherwise. That was a big one for me and I stick by it. 

I also had a therapist who opened a door to a new perspective of the girls are lucky to have me as being me and not a strict parent figure. They have a mam and dad and now they have me who they can feel more safe with sharing things with that they wouldn't share with their parents and that is certainly true. 
I built such a good bond with the girls that they know that I will keep them safe and healthy but I am absolutely someone that they can trust who will not betray them. They come to me with things they are worried about when it comes to HCBM because they know I will talk them through their feelings and I have no hard feelings against her so they won't pick up a bias. 

One thing from myself personally is how I chose to ""parent"" the girls. We are a household of getting the girls to express themselves and learn new things. When someone happens we don't shout, we sit down together ask what happened and how they are feeling because of it and what we can do next time instead. 
We also are huge on having them learn their personalities and making decisions for themselves.
Our biggest rule in the house is that you can make your own decision as long as your kind to yourself, others and the things around you. (Within reason they still have a rough bedtime etc).

Yeah they faced a lot of challenges and made a lot of mistakes, but they also unquestionably made massive strides in improving the material conditions and lives of their people. Classically communist countries see massive leaps in literacy, education, healthcare, and reductions in homelessness, and ''authoritarian'' revolutions like Cuba's did not ""crush"" democracy, there WAS no democracy under Batista, Castro was strictly and objectively better in every possible way than murderous right wing ACTUAL authoritarianism supported by the USA. There was no democracy under the Kuomintang or the Tsar. These were underdeveloped, oppressed, pre-industrial countries that were already suffering famines and poverty that later got conveniently blamed on Communists who objectively made their lives better but all any liberal can think about is """"but what about the newspapers!?!? Do the Fascist right wing scum that oppressed and murdered these people get their newspapers and their liberties to be murderous fascists??"" Meanwhile as these countries were forced to catch up to the rest of the developed world from scratch, without an empire or colonial slave subjects to exploit for labor, they had to constantly and heavily militarize to fight off counter-revolutionary imperialism like the White Army.

"gsoowur","Rampart is actually not great at holding down an area, so playing defensively in the sense of finding out where zone ends and camping there is not optimal in my opinion.

She should be played aggressively in the sense that you need to be looking for fights and angles and be on the move often. 
That said, she also can't be played aggressively in the same way that octane, horizon or wraith can for example. 

My ideal rampart fights are ones where I can deal a lot of damage early on and then push, with the knolwedge that I've got walls behind me if things turn back. So the key is to always have a mid/long range weapon. If enemies are in the open and unaware of me I set up sheila, and try to get one or 2 knocks/shield cracks with it. If I do, usually the enemies are aware of me and find cover. At that point I pack up sheila and push. If enemies are not in the open, or are aware of me, I don't bother with Sheila and use a mid/long range weapon to open the fight and deal high damage from afar. I never play rampart without a long range weapon because if I have to be too near to open a fight, my walls become less useful (they are not a great reactive ability).

As a proactive legend, Rampart requires making good rotation decisions and understanding where teams have dropped and where they are likely to rotate towards. If you can position yourself in a fight so that you can be sure that there is not team behind you, it allows you to leave your walls up. You can then mount an assault by placing a wall, dealing damage, moving to the next cover, placing another wall, dealing damage, etc. It's a very methodical way of pushing a fight and the good thing about it is that it allows an easy retreat. Probably less reward than jumppadding onto a team, but definitely less risk, and in  a BR this is not a bad thing. Of course, when you have really gained an upper hand in the fight by downing one or two players, it's useful to have another legend that can close the gap quickly. This is my biggest issue with rampart, sometimes you are left a bit behind and you have done a lot of damage, but can't quite finish the fight. This is why a passive I keep suggesting on here would be to be able to get a small speed boost when jumping through an amped wall.",1617024801,"if enemies are in the open and unaware of me i set up sheila, and try to get one or 2 knocks/shield cracks with it.","open and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"open and unaware","open",NA,NA,0

"gsmyn38","Anyways, Marduk had begun to hate most of the other Annunaki, and had begun to see himself as the savior of humanity.  Known for his brute strength, Lightning, and what seemed like a magic hammer, Marduk was praised by many humans as Thor the breaker of chains and freer of humanity.  This went to his head, and he began to see himself as the only true hope and light for humanity.  He raised a massive army and began to fight agains the Annunaki to free more humans, but he couldn't resist the vastly superior armaments that Enlil had access to.  This is when Marduk's family friend Loki came up with a plan.  Loki was like Marduk's uncle, he was an Shapeshifting Reptilian Orion Noble who had grown up with Enki Ea and had followed him throughout his life and travels.  Loki convinced Marduk that he could recruit help, because Marduk's incredible bloodline, he could use it to call upon the rogue Orion clans to come to his aid, and fight with him for the throne.  So Loki and Marduk began to travel and recruit, the recruited many of the Grey, Dragon, and Serpent clans.  The Greys produced a clone army, while Loki lead the shapeshifting reptilians to infiltrate Enlil's administrative bases.  Enlil hated humans, and didn't trust them, and instead prefer to use reptilians to run all his facilities because they were less like to question orders.  This made it easy for the reptilians to infiltrate his bases.  Soon the hour was right, and when Anu had called most of the ruling Annunaki away from Earth for a summit, Marduk and Loki struck.  They were able to quickly gain full control of our solar system.

It was at this point that Marduk declared himself Ra the One True God.  He told the humans of Earth that they were now free from the gods slavery, and that he would lead them into a new golden age.  But he found many of the humans revolted and demanded that the old gods return.  Not understanding it, he consulted his advisors.  Loki and the rogue clans were masters of mind control and manipulation.  They convinced Marduk to allow them to mind wipe any dissenters.  They went far beyond what Marduk wanted though.

See Loki was loyal to the Archons, the children of the Beast, Yaldabaoth, father of Demons and Archons.  And the Archons HATED the Annunaki.  You see it was Anshar, the father of King Anu, that defeat Yaldabaoth in combat and had banished him into the Abyss.   The Archons have one mission, the fall of man and the souled beings that banished their father to the Abyss and the rescue of their father from the Abyss.  Not knowing the his allies secretly hated everything about him and humanity, Marduk agreed to allow them to compromise our reincarnation system and add a memory wipe for humans whenever they are reborn.  It used to be that humans were born with all the memories of their previous lives, but Loki put an end to that.   They couldn't fully mind control humanity without first causing them to forget who they were.  They also brought in a damage Andromedan world ship to be our moon, where they now house many of those control systems over us.

Meanwhile Marduk wished to help humanity, not knowing the sinister manipulation being performed behind his back.  Marduk helped the humans build the Tower of Babel, which was located in what is currently the Bermuda Triangle.  It was a massive psychic neural network, not only could humans who were connected to it talk to each other telepathically, they could also download information just like in the Matrix, need to know how to drive a helicopter?  Just download it.  All it required was to get a Neuralink device surgically installed onto your skull. Marduk had created a Utopia on Earth, he had shared most of the knowledge of the gods with humanity, and they were beginning to build their own spaceports and a space fleet.

But soon, Marduk's allies began to make their moves.  The Greys took control of the Tower of Babel, and used it to enslave most of humanity.   The tech was so control, humans were no longer even able to scratch their own noses unless the Greys allowed them to.  They could only walk in the direction the Greys wanted.  Humanity was more than enslaved, they were trapped.   Only the few humans that hadn't gotten the tech implanted were uneffected.

Meanwhile around the same time this is happening, Enlil went to his father King Anu, and told him that if they don't strike now, Marduk was going to build and army to overthrow him.  Not willing to take the chance, King Anu allowed Enlil access to his greatest weapons of war.  The Annuanki lord Ninurta and Nergal were given incredibly powerful warships and were told to erase the empire of Marduk.

This lead to the most destruction this world has seen in hundreds of thousands of years.  This was when Sodom and Gomorrah happened.  This was when most of the world deserts were created.  Northern Africa was once a tropical paradise, when they were finished the Sahara was now a desert and the Golden City of Atlantis in its western reaches was destroyed.  The American Southwest was destroyed and the Grand Canyon was created.  The Gobi desert was created.  The Dead Sea was created.   Last but not least, the Tower of Babel was destroyed, due to the technologies that were involved that destruction of it was what lead to the creation of the Bermuda Triangle anomalies.  But when this happened every human that was connected to it, was completely mind wiped, 95% of humanity didn't even know their own name anymore.

Without his human armies, Marduk was quickly turned on by the Greys and Reptilians, they stormed his estates and chased him off the planet.  The Annunaki tried to return to Earth, but the humans no longer remembered them and would attack them as demons.

"gr7ojdd","The manga definitely messes up a lot, which is why I appreciate the anime so much more. 

Your part about Kisaragi's murder is a good point. This is a good example of where the anime's changes absolutely blow away the manga because in the anime this scene is a fucking gut wrench. Instead of Kisaragi being a sacrifice, she's just collateral damage and the scene turns the opening sequence from a fan servicey bid for blood and gore, into a serious and disturbing sequence of events. It makes the viewer vulnerable, and stops Lucy from being an eyecandy object to being a cold blooded murderer. 

I actually stopped watching elfen lied the first time after that scene because I was not able to stomach that. Despite having watched a lot of bloody gorey anime and movies, and TV series like band of brothers, but that moment got to me in a way I didn't expect. 

Eventually I went back and now I've watched the series an unreasonable amount of times.

There are numerous people with autism, downs syndrome, and other mentally stunting disorders who have expressive sexuality.

There is also this slight maybe implication that Kaede may not be a completely heterosexual person, the scene with Aiko. As well as her fascination with female characters comes off as a sexual attraction that likely comes from Lucy's buried memories. More or less implicated by the fact that Lucy herself as a kid was very awkward and unaware of how to really handle herself. The Zoo and River scene are big hints at this. The way she awkwardly responds to be splashed with water, turning to what looks almost to be on the verge of a fight. And then before that being excited by the animals to point that she cant contain herself despite the public embarrassment she realizes she's causing herself. 

Nyuu being a fully grown adult with these kinds of implications, it isn't all that strange that an adult woman would have sexual feelings, and not exactly understand them in her state.

This is probably something that becomes more clear and apparent in a complexity sense  when someone is around mental illness treatment for a significant amount of time. In-patient and out patient facilities often times will deal with mentally stunted and damaged people who have issues and lack understanding of boundaries. 

Now in the manga this definitely comes off as fan service and inappropriate. But in the anime this is played for a sense that she's just creepy. It keeps the viewer from getting attached the way she does, and Kouta even says ""I wonder who taught Nyuu to be so freaky."" Nodding at the viewer that ""this is not ok""

About the Puppy scene. If you're referring to it being unrealistic in both the anime and manga, unfortunately this is where I have to seriously disagree, because this kind of behavior is absolutely unfortunately realistic. Torturing and killing animals is often an indicator of serious anti social behavior, and is well know as an indicator that someone can become a serial killer. Beating a dog to death in front of someone for the sake bullying or hurting someone else or messing with them is realistic in the sense that, these are all kids who have been abandoned, are unsupervised, and Lucy is obviously their bottom of the pecking order target. Taking away joy from her, in the one situation where she actually reacts is exactly the kind of behavior you see in anti social children. 

Children torturing animals is a well known mood enhancement in anti social or abused children. In-fact this behavior is noted by Psychology today: [""Vehicle for emotional abuse \(for example, injuring a sibling's pet to frighten the sibling\),""](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-equation/201104/children-who-are-cruel-animals-when-worry)

So sadly... this is an unfortunately realistic scenario.

The 2nd half is where most of the manga really begins to fall apart in terms of issues, especially with Kurama, the agent, and the diclonius facility. 

In-fact most of the entire 2nd half of  the manga can be dropped without losing anything in terms of actual story progression. If you read volume 1~7 skipping page 203, and then skip from volume 7 to the last 5 pages of volume 11, you lose absolutely nothing of the story. 

While I rate the anime was one of the best of all time, The manga receives a mere 7 out of 10 from me because of how many issues it brings up.

I mostly use the manga as a bit of a background reference for the anime rather than using it as a definitive storyline. Most people would be the other way around.

It helps explain some of the more implied but not concrete defined things about the anime. 

But beyond that the anime is so much better of a story and handles the themes it deals with in an incredibly powerful and meaningful way.",1615963721,"more or less implicated by the fact that lucy herself as a kid was very awkward and unaware of how to really handle herself.","awkward and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"very awkward and unaware","awkward",NA,"very",0

Yes. I caught that.  Recognizing this doesn't automatically make us morally superior, however. Intentional or not, I think you might be coming off that way.

&gt;It's disheartening to get down voted for stating that we have no idea what happened and shouldn't make any assumptions based on the findings of this investigation.

This isn't all that you said. If you had only stated, ""We have no idea what happened and shouldn't make any assumptions based on the findings of this investigation."" I highly doubt that you'd be getting downvoted.

&gt;I don't think our whole fanebase is racist, but I can't keep denying that they a lot are ignorant and unaware of their bias on issues like this.

There's more than enough bias to go around. The surest way to know someone has significant bias is for them to claim that they have none.  Racism and bigotry are far more complex in source and expression than simply choosing to give the ""appropriate"" individual the benefit is the doubt.  

People could have written what they wrote for a number of different reasons. Our own biases cause us to interprete their motivations the way that we interprete them more even than what words they chose to use.  There's no getting around it. 

Hopefully our awareness of this reality prompts us to give others the benefit of the doubt, especially when our experiences with them are written communication only, and most especially if we're going to extrapolate our observations to an entire demographic.  Failure to do this kind of thing is, after all, at the root of both racism and bigotry.

We count people with racist bias among our number, as do all NBA fanbases.  We're indulging incredible naivete or bigotry if we believe we're alone among fanbases.  We'll be more successful changing things for the better if we directly confront specific erroneous thoughts and behavior, assuming good intentions in those we confront, than we'll be if we indulge in judgement and generalizations.

I didn't understand why they were always around until I was legally an adult and living with my fiance after I had experiences thanks to an exroommate that my dog and I shared and caused more issues with both of us, including in our mental health as I now have PTSD too. The bullying I went through in elementary school is a massive part of why I have did as I know things went physical at least once and suspect it may have possibly gone sexual as well but there was never any witnesses who reported so without trying to get into the memories my trauma holder has, as we're currently working on trying to help her heal because she is the most traumatized one and the one who needs to heal the most for us to heal as a system, despite final fusion not being a goal, because individually, we're all at different places in our healing, I have no concrete this definitely happened outside of the one incident my mom heard three different stories from me about. That incident resulted in a broken arm and my mom tried to find out what happened but no one was able to tell her what happened because only the bullies and my headmates knew. I have also recently learned that my first split(when my protector was formed) was due to watching 9/11 just 14 days before my 2nd birthday because my dad also around that time was in another state for work and my mom did not know how to help me and despite trying to, she was unable to get me help or the resources to help me with dealing with the emotions I was dealing with or anything else because people kept telling her, she'll be fine only for me 20 years later to disprove everyone who was saying that it wouldn't do any long term harm. Maybe they would have been right if it weren't for the bullies but who knows but I also only got confirmation on that this calendar year so I no longer doubt because a couple of incidents may have been not that bad on their own but combined, all of my experiences while I was under 10 were definitely bad enough to scar a child. Heck, it would even do damage to an adult, especially if my suspicions are correct and I strongly suspect I'm not too far off on at least a few of my suspicions/theories about why we're a system/what we've been through and I think the fact that we've been in therapy since first grade is why we were able to stay a small system as well as had all the clues to figure out we had did in highschool but didn't have the knowledge until a couple of years later.",1615766667,"when i was younger and unaware of my did to a degree because i was interacting with the others in my head but i did not understand that they are not beings who have their own separate body or had literally passed but stayed in this world as a spirit, had i known i had did, i certainly would have been questioning it a lot more than i am as a young adult even though i just knew it was really bad without the knowledge i have now.","younger and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"young and unaware","young",NA,NA,0

"gqw2eey","It's my experience that this voice comes in the same way our inner voice does and thinks the same way in pictures and concepts. 

""I"" have the thought, but I discern by, following the conversation I guess. For example: I was just sitting here thinking of my sleeping family and friends in the house currently and considering the things I love about them. I was enjoying listening to their snores and began sort of thinking of them all like children when the idea of ""No child left behind"" popped into my head. While that was not the thought I was currently focusing on, I've recently also been wondering about enlightenment/salvation and the ability of everyone to get there. 

I had already determined for myself recently after much reading, thinking, and observing my feelings that yes, everyone not only has the ability, but it's like a roller coaster that isn't stopping anyway, it was never NOT going to happen. It's nature's cycle. Which brings me back to ""no child left behind"". In a moment of present awareness and gratitude, my confirmation came!

I also read a story once about a shaman who while passing on his teachings taught his ""student"" a way of understanding the visions he saw while hallucinating. They used a very, very long and complex ritual to put deep into the student's mind that whatever he saw he would have a guide whispering the meaning in his ear. If he were to forget he had a guide and begin focusing too much on the details of the vision, he would become lost and unaware of any meaning. My interpretation of this based on my own experience is that the ritual was there to deeply ingrain within the student the confidence that they would understand all they would see and hear, no matter how it appeared on the surface. 

This confidence can be given over to one's own heart (in my experience). When deeply in high energetic awareness, I am well aware my heart can discern the meaning of all things and relay it to me. The meaning being only how it all correlates to everything else to see it as a part of a whole containing within it an image of the whole. 

To get there my ""guide"" brings me memories in pictures and thoughts. I hear a song, a lyric pops out at me, it reminds me of something I've been thinking about, I keep my attention there and Eureka! A connection appears! I can follow that connection to continue the conversation, I wonder about it, I see a literal billboard saying ""Paradise is Here!""

I just moved to Miami and hadn't driven a lot here. First few times, I didn't notice much. Today, I went for a long drive inland towards Doral.

I had 2 people randomly switch lane on the freeway to exit right at the end. I'm talking maybe 3-car lengths from the exit at high speed. It's like they didn't plan at all and there was no freaking traffic. So they could have easily driven fast in the slow lane if they were expecting to get off, but nope. Last minute it is! 👀

Then on a slower road, I had a guy not planning at stopping at a stop sign and almost plowed into me. Then a little down the street, a lady nearly hit me as traffic let her through, but she didn't see me coming on the lane over and I hit my brakes hard. ABS came on and the car kept sliding. I almost hit her, and thank god she stopped in time otherwise she would have plowed right into the front passenger side. These are 25-40 mph sections. Stupid lady was trying to do an illegal left crossing multiple lanes! 👀

Then on the way back home, I saw a guy exit, then realize he went the wrong way, so he drove right across the grass and back into traffic. I also had a guy put what looks like a thin metal siding on his truck bed sticking out, unmarked and it wasn't fastened, and there is a good chance at high speed that thing will fly right off and possibly hit someones windshield and decapitate. The guy? Too busy talking on the phone.

Let's just say, I have never seen anything like this. My significant other, doesn't even have the radio on when she drives around here, because people are completely clueless and unaware of their surroundings. She has to be extra careful on the road.

I'm not just talking about people driving fast, cutting you off or weaving in and out of traffic, but the sort of thing that even those people wouldn't do shit like that.

I was flabbergasted and I've lived in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco for many years. I've seen some stupid things in my time, but never so many in such short succession. As for my driving experience? I've driven a car for over 20-years and never had a single car accident. I've driven in snow, in Europe and some of the biggest cities in the US.

Do you really want to risk your life around here biking with people like that?

"gqt7h9n","Because they actually do. All it takes is a few minutes of research and you will see it’s true. Okay so if you don’t want to believe in The Illuminati, look up a REAL organization like The Masons. There is a Masonic temple is just about every city. They certainly have secret handshakes which members use to identify themselves to one another publicly. 

Now after you look up the Masonic handshakes and other hand symbols, look up the Illuminati 666 “ok” hand sign, or the devils horns, or the ok over the eye, or covering one eye in general. Go through all of the pictures of famous celebrities and politicians making these same gestures over and over and over again. Do normal people do this shit? 

I am not saying to you that this stuff is real. I am just asking you to put your narcissistic urge to yell yourself that you know every already and you’re absolutely right. We live in a crucial time right now, and it’s time to examine all angles without bias. This is all I’m asking of you. Ask yourself “what if I’m wrong?”.

Are you strong enough to do that? Or is your ego and need to be right fully in control of your decision making and thought process? Are you strong enough to question yourself and your beliefs?

Did you know CIA’s website host a document titled “bloodlines of the Illuminati” which details all of the bloodlines of this supposedly fictional group? Google it and see for yourself. 

For those ignorant and unaware of the claims behind the conspiracy, it is said that the Illuminati broadcasts their intentions and flaunts their plans in plain sight. They tell you what they are doing and what is happening. People who believe the conspiracy see South ParQ as having done exactly that:

They highlighted the plans publicly, but in a mocking way where most of the public will think it’s a joke or mocking people who believe it. The South Park creators even feature themselves in the episode, among the Hollywood elites, telling you that they are part of it, but again dressed up as a good. During all of this, the scene is filled with “666”, one eye, pyramid and other Illuminati symbolism. 

The claim is that the Illuminati uses Hollywood to brainwash all of us via the media. In order to be successful in Hollywood/Politics you must engage in rituals, and be photographed during the rituals, so that they have something to hold over your head to control you. Don’t say a word or we will release these photos or what you did to gain your fame and wealth.

There’s a video on YouTube of a young Angelina Jolie talking to her friends and describing rituals she engaged in, and how she has compromising photos on people. 

Now I am not telling you this is true. I am telling you these are the claims. You should go read into it because these crazies who believe in this, whom you mock, aren’t just believing it for no reason. And this isn’t a right wing nutcase thing. 
These conspiracies and ideas existed well before the Qanon thing.

Now if there is a group controlling the entire world, and the media, and you are believing the media when it tells you there’s no conspiracy, it is sortve akin to you asking Jefferey Dahmer if he is a murderer and fully believing him when he says no.

Of course he wants you to think that.

I am not saying this shit is true. I am saying at least research it. People aren’t just believing it for no reason or without any kind of evidence. 

What if it IS true? 

Are you gonna be the unaware jackass who fucked himself because he spent all this time patting himself on the pat, thinking he knows everything already?

We live in different times now. There ain’t no time for that type of narcissism. Open your mind and get out of this “us versus them” Democrats versus Republicans blue versus red left versus right mentality. Because that shit will keep you blinded to how this world works by giving you a false identity, a false sense of community, a false enemy, and a false sense of self validation.

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening.

"gqqvthx","&gt; Last night I went on to the sex offender registry, and went through the list of names to find the most vulnerable one. I found one after around 2 hours. It was a 32 year old man 130 pounds, and had diabetes. I knew that he would put up little resistance since he was weak and legally not allowed to own a gun. That night I drove over to his house and scouted out a couple of potential entry points. I finally decided to push in the hall fan in one of the 1st story windows, and I waited until all the lights in the neighborhood were out before doing so. Once I got inside the house I looked around for any potential animals.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I had completely forgotten to check if he had any dogs, but luckily I didn't see any. I started down the hall way and went up the stairs. I stepped on the edge of each step so as not to make any noise. Once I came to the bedroom, I saw that his door was wide open and that I could see him laying there quiet and unaware of the fate that was to befall him. I pulled out my knife and stepped quietly into the room. I walked right up to him and reached over holding the knife to his throat. By this point he was awake, but he and I both knew that if he screamed I would cut out his vocal cords.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I sat there for a while feeling him quiver under my arm, but then I knew what I had to do. I raised up the knife and stabbed him as much as I physically could. After around the 12th time I knew he was dead, but part of me wouldn't let the other part stop, so I kept stabbing into his chest with all my might. By the time I was out of breath and exhausted I had stabbed him 54 times, and I was covered head to toe in his blood. All the blood and gore gave me a boner the size of the Eifel tower, and I proceeded to fuck the body. Ever since then I've been fantasizing every night about my next kill.

When big butts are a beauty standard, you see ppl working towards that. When pale or tan skin is, ppl follow suit. 

Bright white, perfectly aligned teeth is only becoming a global beauty standard due to American influence.

The colour of the teeth has a lot to do with the amount of tea adult Britons drink. You would notice children’s teeth are less stained. Also the paler the complexion, the yellower the teeth appear. It’s why they often use darker completed people with bright lips in tooth related ads.

Your mother on the other hand sounds like one of the biggest AHs ever. She’s the one who chose to marry someone who wouldn’t treat you with love and kindness.

I truly hope you get into therapy. I can’t imagine the guilt you feel on top of your mother treating you so poorly. I sincerely hope you can get some peace of mind about the accident.

Also, please make sure for at least the time being you block your mother and step-father. Have your grandparents run interference since they seem to have your best interests at heart. You don’t need the extra stress on top of everything else that’s going on.

"gqixyku","Unfortunately,  parents don't always understand or aren't capable of giving you the emotional support you need. Abuse is a complex thing, and I would argue a lot of people don't get off without emotional scars from parents. My mom falls into this ambiguous category were she can be a very good and nurturing parent, but her parenting falls apart when she drinks, and she is in denial about many important issues. 

In your case (this is just speculation since I don't know you), it seems like your mom could be scared and unaware of mental health issues, so she responded in anger. It can be very hard to deal with parents that don't understand, and even when you make progress, they may never get there. 

The best thing I can say is everyone's journey is different to healing, and you should work towards what you think will help you the most. Maybe if you have another honest conversation with your mom, she might let you start therapy, which could equip you with better tools to cope with your family. If your mom refuses to give in, you can try to find community supports in your school or even get your own therapy appointments if you are independent enough to go without your mom's consent. As for the abuse, if you feel really unsafe or uncomfortable, you can try to reach out to the community or get a 3rd party involved to deal with your case.

"gqfb019","I'd be interested to know what makes you suspect the OT god isn't the one god. Is he a representation of it, like one facet of a jewel, or a separate being? 

I do like Jesus' style some of the time, I just couldn't get behind what all Christians share as the foundation of the faith; that Jesus was brutally executed as payment for our sins (and that's a *good* thing) and the only way to salvation is through him. I was raised in an energetic Baptist church in Glasgow (not the same as Baptists in the US) and there seemed to be something faintly sadomasochistic about it. Everyone was full of joy, yet they were singing happily about being washed in the blood of the lamb and how they were nothing without god and Jesus.

That's the exclusivity I was talking about earlier. I'm far from perfect but I don't believe I need to be forgiven by anyone except those I've wronged. After much work I've managed to forgive myself for the mess I made of my life and I will try to explain myself and apologise to people I've caused pain to, but I don't understand what Jesus has to do with that? My salvation came through art, through digging into my own heart to see what was in there, and after excavating through the dross what I found was love. Humans are flawed through no fault of our own, so blaming ourselves for that and believing we genuinely deserve hell/annihilation/separation from god, believing we are worthless without the love of god and Jesus is unacceptable to me, it's a way of debasing ourselves.

The statement that ""drunkards will not enter heaven"" also seems highly judgemental and unaware of the realities that alcoholics face. My impression is that it's as though such people are morally corrupt in some way, that they have 'chosen' to drink themselves into a stupor because it's enjoyable, rather than the reality that most heavy drinkers are desperately trying to escape some intolerable feeling or situation.

Who decides what an appropriate amount is? The story I told above happened because I was already a heavy drinker, because I hated myself and my life. It's sheer luck that I also had a facility for sculpture, and that I had the focus to be able to make coherent pieces while intoxicated. As an anxious, shy, reserved person there's just no way I would have been able to soberly throw myself into the work with as much energy, freedom and openness as it took to shake myself up enough to change my self image.

Of course, it is undeniably unhealthy to drink too much too often, it harms our physical health and can impact work and social relationships negatively. Everything in moderation - including moderation imo. Covid has shut me back in the closet which has been difficult and caused occasional destructive binges, but mostly I'm on top of it now.

"gqea8sw","#Hey, /u/Thr0awayBoi, your post is missing an important statement about your age and what you're looking for in an RP. Just repost with the required disclaimer and it'll be approved instantly. 

You **MUST** include **""I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+""** in your post. Please correct this and repost.

**This is a copy of the original post:**

As a sub I’m fine with being things from your son, to a friend, to a boyfriend, to your son’s friend. As a sub I can be a virgin who’s never really had any sexual experiences, I can be someone who just got out of a rough relationship and is looking for someone to be close to, I can be someone who’s only had bad sexual experiences who needs someone to show him what a real time with a woman is like, or I could even be someone just very naive and unaware of your sexual advances and the like. You could play my mom, a close childhood friend, my girlfriend, or a friend’s mom. Honestly, I’m open to other ideas as well, those are just the ones I thought of.

This can be a long term rp or short term depending on how you’d like to take it and as a dom even though you’re gentle, are you also filled with lust and using me for your desires or do you want nothing but to help relieve my stress and help me enjoy a nice time sexually. Perhaps even though you’re gentle, it’s noncon because you decide to take me whenever you want to satisfy yourself or because you know it’ll be a good experience for me in the end. Maybe you’re gentle with how you talk, but you like the sex hard and fast. You’re free to take what being a gentle dom means to you in whatever direction you like. It can be short term if you’d like to do a sort of one shot or it can be long term if you’d like to build the relationship over time and develop the rp further. 

In the end I really just want to see what kind of gentle dom you’ll be and what kind of sub you’d like me to be so I am very open to whatever you’d like to try and am totally fine with you taking the reigns in the rp and leading things. I do have some kinks and limits though. 
Some of my kinks are:Noncon, degrading, cock worship, ass worship, dirty talk, incest, rough sex, creampies, anal
Some of my limits are:Blood, bathroom stuff, animals, feet stuff, rimming

I look forward to working with you! ^^

I didn't plan on giving ONLY dog food out, I did make sure to have dry and wet cat food, as well as treat cat food, to provide him with a varied diet.

"gqcd2pe","My heart really goes out to you. You’ve stayed strong in a very hard situation and you did what is right for yourself. I made the same choice two years ago, and I’ve been soaring ever since. Though it’s hard feeling alone and the amount of work that your caretakers has caused you is infuriating a lot of the time. I totally get that. I often fantasize about who I would be if I came from a regular, healthy family too, and I can’t help but feel resentful that I have to spend so much of my time and energy healing myself. Though..,a cool thing is that after all the therapy and self help, I’m starting to be in a place where I’m actually stronger and wiser than most people. Most people, are actually pretty soft and unaware of themselves because they never had to overcome this level of trauma. Like, I can see that they don’t really understand themselves or others that much (lots of confusion as to why someone is different from them and not understanding their actions or choices a lot of the time). It’s oddly turned into a blessing. I don’t take things for granted (I have real ambition for a nice life), and if something is toxic, I don’t just ignore it  and try to learn to live with it...I just take care of it. 

Anyway, I wanted to say that you might want to look into the book “Adult children of Emotionally Immature Parents.”....that book is life changing, and it could help you to start to connect with others better. You’re definitely probably subconsciously pushing others away because your trust for others is very low. But this is not something you have to live with for the rest of your life. Not even close. There is so much help out there. That book is a great place to start tho. Your self esteem is probably really messed up too (which also effects connection) so maybe also start looking into how to improve your self esteem. 

I know it’s annoying to have to put work into this especially when it seems like others around you are more functional and don’t need to do anything at all, but I was also going to warn you that I wasted about 6 years of my life hoping that things would just sort of work themselves out. I’m not saying that you won’t heal at all, but I’ve found taking issues by the horns has catapulted me forward. I was so messed up that my physical health was suffering a lot, and I can tell you I’m so much healthier and more positive nowadays. More confident too.

"gq41k9p","""Some men don't change, they reveal"" (quote from ""Inland Empire""). 

12 clues to unravel the last ambiguous Cooper's actual identity as yet another BOB-parasitized Doppelgänger:

1) Annie doesn't add anything related to a 25-year cycle, her line is supposed to be read as ""The good Dale is in the Lodge and he can't (ever) leave (period)"", 25 years are the ones intercurring between the theatrical release of FWWM and the airing of season 3;

2) the evolution of the Arm _calls_ *that* Cooper ""BOB...BOB...BOB..."" while there's apparently no BOB there;

3) ""Dougie"" shares with Mr. C the memory of having killed Jack the mechanic, when Bushnell sends him to the Mitchums he repeats the word ""dead"" and pushes his hand on his own cheeks squeezing them with the fingers;

4) the very last frame during the credits to the finale suggest we go ""back to starting position"" and rewatch it all at the light of the whisper in *that* Cooper's ear by Laura/Carrie, well, someone on Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/steven-guy-10/lauras-whispered-message-to-dale-cooper) took seriously the invitation to ""listen to the sounds"" and cleared/cleaned the audio to such whisper, the result is the following line ""Don't assume no-one can spot your dark suit off but me""...what do we have on *that* Cooper's dark suit? 

The FBI pin, that was missing (""something is missing"" and ""it has to do with Special Agent Dale Cooper"", the Log Lady told Hawk) from the good Dale's suit both in FWWM and in the beginning there at the Fireman's in the b/w sequence of season 3 (which occurs right during the scene off Part.17 where Mr. C enters the White Lodge, it's him the ""it"" that was in their house then and the good Dale only gets invibilized not to be seen by his Doppelgänger).

On the FBI pin, there is the same pattern as that of the symbol drawn on Mr. C's Ace of Spades card as shown by him (rotated by 180°, i.e. upside down, so it's not a demon face with ears) to Darya, blackened as in an ""omissis"" like in ""classified"" military documents (that's a typical word used by Major Briggs and ""classified"" is also a taboo, something ""you don't wanna know about"", as Hawk told Frank Truman about the same symbol on his own ""living map""), and on the very FBI logo there's also a balance....remember the Log Lady saying that ""balance is the key"", and the events of season 3 take place under the zodiac sign of Balance (from September 23 to October 2, 2016), it all being another clue to decipher the ending, which is a subtle reference to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""...there we had a ""Scottie"" dealing with acrophobia and a ""Judy"" falling and screaming down from a _bell_ tower, here we have a scottish-surnamed actor (MacLachlan) almost losing his balance before Laura/Carrie screams after realizing (only her, not him, who's still confused and unaware of the Fireman's masterplan) they've trespassed the Threshold between fiction and reality (Jowday, which is both a sentient entity - Ishtar/Isis/Venus/Mystery-Babylon/Babalon/Freya/Kali/Lady Liberty - and a force, a concept, with her codename derived from a scottish verb, ""Jow"", coined in the year 1515 AD to mean both ""to knock"" and ""to toll a bell"", something recalled by the very title of Part. 16, ""No knock, no doorbell"");

5) during the talk with Jeffries in Part. 17, Mike's facial expression turns very negative, as if he's realizing he's just helped the wrong person (Mike's unaware of the Fireman's masterplan);

6) when Carrie asks *that* Cooper ""D.C.?"" and he answers ""No, the State"", they're not just talking about Washington, the dialogue can also be ""read"" like ""Are you D.C., i.e. Dale Cooper?"" ""No, I'm not"";

7) why doesn't Mr.C go kill ""Dougie"" by himself instead of hiring failed hitmen?

Because, like Poe's ""William Wilson"" teaches us, Doppelgängerin can't kill their own selves or that would mean suicide.

8) when the Fireman abducts Andy, he shows him the two Coopers as sides of the same coin, or rather like born out of a cellular mitosis (Mr. C's fixation with cellphones is another revealer);

9) the scene at the sheriff's station in Part.17 being interrupted by the line ""We live inside a dream"" (a meta-realization referring to a ""celluloid dream"") spoken by the same one &amp; only good Cooper seen in b/w at the beginning implies that there can't possibly be two good Dale's at the same time, so the ones at the station are both Doppelgängerin, except one of them is disguised as the good guy but they're in rivalry for the only one ""slot"" of survival outside the Black Lodge's ""firechair"" awaiting both, and my theory is that in season 2's ending each time Cooper took a wrong path inside the Red Room's corridors, a different Doppelgänger was born, all of them parasitized by BOB (which behaves exactly like Chlamydia, but that would be too long to explain now), that this way can be inside more than just one human host at the same time, but the other Doppelgänger cheated the evolution of the Arm by trying to go outside the Black Lodge before Mr.C came back in (note that Mr. C didn't manufacture Dougie, since the only one who's got the cloning technology is Mike's own Doppelgänger, he only tried to took advantage of the awareness of Dougie's existence to turn the FBI against him through the manipulated tulpa of Diane, and Diane herself actually died right after the alleged rape of the early '90s, and the near-death trauma caused the self-birth of the tulpa).

10) why does the evolution of the Arm repeat to the last ""Cooper"" the line Audrey told Charlie about the ""story of the little girl who lived down the lane""?

Charlie's place was taken over by a fitting room's vanity mirror, and the evolution of the Arm was once a dwarf like Charlie, so this means that the one the Arm is talking to is just a mere _reflection_ of the good Dale (and ""Inland Empire"" helps us understand that ""reflections"" and ""Doppelgängerin"" are the same things, I refer to the speech by Grace Zabriskie about ""Little Boy"" - the atomic bomb cousin to the Trinity Test within the same Manhattan Project - and the birth of Evil during the trespassing of the Threshold);

11) why would the good Dale re-meet the fake Diane outside the red curtains to the Black Lodge at Glastonberry Grove instead of, say, Jackrabbit's Palace there on Blue Pine Mountain?

12) as a further confirmation, on Major Briggs' original printed radio-message in season 2 there were _five_ ""COOPER""s in line (1 good Dale, 2 evil Doppelgängerin, 1 Dougie and 1 new clone ""back home"" in Las Vegas as Dougie-bis)",1615136446,"c's ace of spades card as shown by him (rotated by 180°, i.e. upside down, so it's not a demon face with ears) to darya, blackened as in an ""omissis"" like in ""classified"" military documents (that's a typical word used by major briggs and ""classified"" is also a taboo, something ""you don't wanna know about"", as hawk told frank truman about the same symbol on his own ""living map""), and on the very fbi logo there's also a balance....remember the log lady saying that ""balance is the key"", and the events of season 3 take place under the zodiac sign of balance (from september 23 to october 2, 2016), it all being another clue to decipher the ending, which is a subtle reference to hitchcock's ""vertigo""...there we had a ""scottie"" dealing with acrophobia and a ""judy"" falling and screaming down from a _bell_ tower, here we have a scottish-surnamed actor (maclachlan) almost losing his balance before laura/carrie screams after realizing (only her, not him, who's still confused and unaware of the fireman's masterplan) they've trespassed the threshold between fiction and reality (jowday, which is both a sentient entity - ishtar/isis/venus/mystery-babylon/babalon/freya/kali/lady liberty - and a force, a concept, with her codename derived from a scottish verb, ""jow"", coined in the year 1515 ad to mean both ""to knock"" and ""to toll a bell"", something recalled by the very title of part.","confused and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"still confused and unaware","confused",NA,"still",0

When I was first born and my mom tried to breastfeed me, I’d seem fine at first but then projectile vomit the milk back up within the hour. This happened every single time she fed me.

She took me to a different hospital, who suggested we go to Seattle Children’s. There they immediately diagnosed me with pyloric stenosis which is a birth defect where the valve between my stomach and small intestine is essentially stuck shut, which prevents food from moving through the GI system and nutrients being absorbed. They did an emergency surgery to correct it, and I was able to eat and digest completely fine after that.

"gosvoyy","I'm starting to believe that maybe we should bring back the *""levels""* of MGTOW. I don't recall why they fell out of use. It was a good idea from the start since it is obvious that MGTOW is like a spectrum, some are Monks on one end and at the other end we have the Red Pilled who are barely waking up. 

Nevertheless from the beginning MGTOW was always touted as *""That Movement of men who are swearing off women and forsaking relationships with them.""*

Take [this article](http://wagner.edu/newsroom/files/2015/11/151115-Sunday-Times-UK-Meet-the-men-giving-up-on-women-Miles-Groth-quoted.pdf) from 2015 for example. Or [The Sexodus](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2014/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out-of-society/) article from the year before that. Then there is the infamous [Barbarossa video](https://youtu.be/dyenSX4XSZA) from way back in 2010 where he speaks of MGTOW in all but name. 

MGTOW actually has multiple origins, the one you are talking about is the origin of the moniker but it is not the origin of the spirit nor the movement itself. MGTOW existed before it had a name, when the label came out and gained some popularity it gathered momentum when pre-MGTOW Monks and offshoot MRAs all started to converge under this new term. In that respect, MGTOW originated in a similar manner as many springs converging to form a great river that has now started to overflow and flood other areas. 

I have also heard the phenomena called other odd names. ""MGTOW"" was the one that stuck and became the most popular because it served as a point of convergence among such a wide and disparate range of men who were all *""moving away""* from women and especially traditional *and* liberal values. It is a great middle finger to both the Left and the Right.

Perhaps we should bring back the levels to end this argument. And I say there should only be 4 Stages as thus:

Level 1. **Red Pilled and Aware**. When a man is aware of Female Nature but is still ignorant and unaware of Gynocentrism making him naive enough to believe in Blue Pilled principles of dating and relationships. This mas still believes in dating, relationships, and that Unicorns are rare but they exist. This is the stage where men enter the bargaining phase and believe that if they can just change a law. change an attitude, or change something about themselves then things will go back to the good old days not realize that there were never any good old days, it was all part of the delusion they are starting to wake up from.

Level 2. **Red Pilled and Weary**. Is knowledgeable enough about Female Nature and is aware enough about Gynocentrism that he reject all long-term/personal relationships with women. No dating, no co-habitation, no marriage. Is still interested in sex and flings and is willing to take those risks under the knowledge that they are indeed risks and is still willing to gamble on their hefty price. Men in this stage are still in the bargaining phase while slowly entering into the depression phase.

Level 3. **Red Pilled and Pissed.** This is the Red Pill rage phase where a man is more fully awake, aware, weary, and knowledgeable about the facts and the reality of both Gynocentrism and Female Nature. This man rejects all relationships with women: Dating, Flings, Casual Sex, friendships etc. He may or may not still retain the use of prostitutes though due to the finality of such a transactional act. This is the stage where a man is most vulnerable to snap back and tumble down the steps back into the Blue Pilled mentality or snap in the other direction and do something stupid. 

Level 4. **Red Pilled and Disciplined**. This is when men have come to terms with reality itself and have moved foreword with their lives, set new priorities for themselves, and have now completely rejected all females. Men at this stage are indifferent to women, feel no solidarity and no sympathy for them and have disciplined themselves to such a degree as to keep all of their interactions with females strictly to business. If a female does not benefit or advance any of his goals in any possible way she will not take up any of his attention - he will not give her the time of day. Men at this stage are ambitiously focused on their own quality of life, have discovered how to build meaning in their life and pursue their own best interests accordingly. Men at this stage know and understand peace and how to get it. This is the stage where a man is truly free. This is the stage where Monks and Veteran MGTOW are at.",1614319630,"when a man is aware of female nature but is still ignorant and unaware of gynocentrism making him naive enough to believe in blue pilled principles of dating and relationships.","ignorant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"still ignorant and unaware","ignorant",NA,"still",0

"gol2njn","I'm currently working on my book ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People."" The first 3 chapters are on how women are taught to interact with other women. The next 3 are on how we're taught to prioritize others' needs over our own. I'm kidding of course.

But here's how as a woman, I've managed to make and keep friends who are also women.

1. Acceptance. I had to get over the urge to nitpick and judge other people. I had to realize my friends are who they are and that's ok.

2. A shared purpose. Whether that's going to paint nights, joining a dance team, or a community organization, it helps to be part of something.

3. Don't waste time running a steeplechase. If a friend group, dance group, PTA etc expects you to jump fences in order to be ""allowed"" to be a part of what they're doing, cut yourself loose. They're friends, or they're not.

4. If the rules are different for you than for the rest of the group, it's time to go.

5. Follow the unspoken code. Female friend groups often form to protect eachother and stay safe. Dont be the girl who leaves a drunk friend alone at a party, never has her back in a fight, and takes everyone else's side in an argument.

6. Be kind and understanding. Especially when someone has trauma. Believe friends when they come to you for help. ""Are you sure it was rape?"" Are you sure you want friends?

7. Avoid people who spread rumors about others. It might seem fun to be a part of that, but one day you might be the butt of the joke. It's better to be alone than to force someone else to be alone and unaware of why.

8. Girls are usually right about eachother. Don't hang out with a girl because someone you hate, hates her. I used to have a friend (A) who I ended up hanging out with because we had a mutual friend (B) who was a total flake. We got talking when B ghosted an event. But B had always told me A had an issue with picking fights and getting her kicked out of places. That was also true. A and V both kinda sucked, and deserved eachother.

9. Girls tell you things about eachother/themselves  to see if you can keep a secret. If you spread rumors, you fail. Learn to keep secrets.

10. Avoid girls who have ""mostly guy friends"", or openly talk about drugs or their onlyfans etc. If that's what they're serving you, you dont want to know what they're hiding.

11. Expand your age borders. Talk to women who are older and younger than you. A diverse friend group is just more fun.

12. Find your people. Nuns don't go to the bar looking for besties. But they make a lot of friends at the convent",1614177067,"it's better to be alone than to force someone else to be alone and unaware of why.","alone and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"alone and unaware","alone",NA,NA,0

"gofuuzr","Hey everybody!

So, in my next session, my players plan on talking to this dragon in its cave. They know next to nothing about the dragon, save its name. The players have been tasked with parting a crystal bowl from the dragon as part of a hostage exchange (bowl for civilians). The bowl itself is minorly magic: it produces light when filled with water. 

The dragon itself is uninvolved and unaware of the hostage situation: it spends most of its time sleeping in the light of the bowl, dreaming placid dreams to distract itself from its long untended wounds. It's eaten its entire horde in its isolation, save a smattering of gems (I'm working off of E.E Knight's interpretation, dragons convert metal into scales), and it has lost one of its wings due to lack of care.

So what I'm looking for help with is its reaction to the players' request for the bowl. For a lot of reasons, from personal pride to a desperate need to escape its current situation, it doesn't want to just give the thing up. But neither can it just spew fire and crush them; it's scaleless, missing a wing, and emaciated.

"goejt95","The afternoon sun hung high in the sky above the Order of Heroes’ keep. Below it, the people and heroes happily celebrated the day of devotion with one another. Vendors happily called out their wares to people walking by, couples and families walked happily with one another, and some sat back and watched it all happen. 

Eir watched the town from high above through a window in the Order’s keep. The Day of Devotion intrigued her. Due to Hel’s machinations she only had false and fleeting memories of what it was like to spend all day with her family. Her mother’s gentle smile and her father’s kind touch, she smiled softly as she remembered them, basking in the youth of her childhood. 

She closed her eyes as she remembered bringing a small flower to show her mother. A child’s innocence and desire to please her parents. She was so innocent then, so happy and unaware of everything, but for that moment it was fine. Blissfully she ran up to her mother to show her the orchid, and when her mother turned around, she saw Hel’s face. 

The sight caused her eyes to snap open as she brought a dagger to her wrist in an instant. She felt her pulse quicken and for a moment she feared Hel was there. Thankfully the corridor was clear, she was the only one there. She sighed, returning Lyfja to her sleeve, Hel’s influence on her memories was still there, perverting them into sights that brought anger instead of comfort. 

She pushed herself back from the window and contemplated if she should return to Hel. She was god of the dead, the festival was for the living. Despite this fact, a part of her still wanted to participate, her life in Hel had been bleak and lifeless. Here was a chance to finally experience some feeling of life. 

Her thoughts were interrupted as Anna stormed around the corner, fuming about something. She hardly noticed Eir as she stormed down the hallway, her eyes glued to a piece of paper.  Eir believed the woman would’ve walked right past her and never noticed her if she didn’t say anything. “Hello Anna, how are you doing?”

Anna jumped, scrambling for the paper. When she recovered she placed a hand over her chest, breathing heavily. “Eir, how good to see you there, you startled me. Where- where’d you come from?”

“I was standing right here, you almost walked right past me.”

“Right right, of course.” Her hand tightened around the report. “By the way, have you happened to see Phoena anywhere?” She said happily. She did a good job of hiding the anger in her voice.

“I have not seen her recently.” She lied. She felt that Phoena would be much better if her moment with Marcurio wasn’t interrupted by Anna.

“Curses, I need her to finish filing these tax reports, and she decided to skip out on me. I need to be down there, not stuck up here.”

“Why’s that?”

“Think Eir, think of all that sweet sweet money changing hands down there! She trapped me up here! That accursed woman! She holds no love for the years we shared together! When I get my hands on her I’ll drown her in paperwork.”

“You don’t want to enjoy the festival?”

“Well I do have all my sisters, but none of them are here right now. Past that, I have almost come to see the Order as a family. They’re all good people. Alfonse will make an excellent king when the time comes, Sharena never seems to lose her joy and, Phoena, regardless of which one it is, well, she’s a good person, she has her heart in the right place. I’ve known them for years. I don’t really feel that I need a day to celebrate with them.” Anna looked past Eir, out the window. There was a smile on her face, proud and happy for the others. For a moment, Eir caught a glimpse at the woman Anna could be at times.

“Besides I can use all the good feelings to get some money out of other couples today. Boys will trip over themselves to buy a gift for their girl, and I’ve gotta be there.” 

Eir sighed as the Anna she knew returned. “I was debating going and joining the festival myself.”

“You? That sounds like a good idea, I can’t imagine Hel is too happy a place to be at all the time.” Anna sighed. “I know your relationship with family has been… rough, but there is everyone here in the Order. I’m sure they’d be happy to see you at the festival.”

“Are you sure?”

“Completely. I know Alfonse and Sharena would be thrilled to see you, and Phoena too if she’s hiding out down there.”

“Thank you, take care Anna.”

“You as well Eir, and I hope you have a nice time at the festival.” Anna waved at Eir before wandering back down the corridor, softly muttering to herself as she was reinvested into her paper.

This asshole accuses everyone of insulting them while actually insulting them.  

This asshole accuses people of spreading propaganda while literally spreading propaganda.

"goch37u","Comparing the US and UK's crime clearance rates is instructive here, and I already happen to have this data from a previous argument about exactly the same thing.

According to the US's NCVS (National Crime Victimization Survey), the US had about [21 million violent crimes + thefts](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf) in 2018. According to the FBI, we had 10.3 million arrests in 2018.

According to the UK, they had [698,737 arrests](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/number-of-arrests/latest) over the same period. [The CSEW](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2018) (Crime Survey for England and Wales) put it at 1,259,000 violent crimes and 3,585,000 thefts.

Note that these figures are a bit misleading; a naive view of the US stats would suggest that we're capturing a bit less than 50% of all criminals. Remember, however, that some crimes have multiple perpetrators, and some crimes (such as drug crimes and DUIs) don't have ""victims"" (so won't show up in the NCVS), so the [actual clearance rate](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/clearances) is about 46% for violent crimes and about 18% for property crimes.

The comparable figure in the UK is apparently a depressing [9%.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44884113) The violent crime clearance rate there is only 11%, which is less than 1/4th the US rate, and the theft clearance rate is apparently around 6%, which is about 1/3rd the US rate.

So yeah, the differences are pretty stark.

"go9p3gf","You talk about how on each trip to the dark tower Roland is hopefully making character improvements and the reason he gets looped back is because he isn't who he needs to be yet to achieve control of the tower; yet you also talk about how he needs to realize choosing the tower is choosing damnation, so he needs to choose to quit the quest after saving the beams.

Is there a scenario for you guys where Roland learns the lessons he needs and develops his character enough where he achieves control of the tower? Why is the tower bothering to refine him if not to allow him access?

When I read through the series a second time, in my mind whenever Roland made comments about ""I don't know how I know, I just know..."", it was because he eventually reaches the tower and has knowledge or access to knowledge he wouldn't otherwise have. It would also allow him to project that knowledge from the tower to himself or the tet members when necessary, even if anonymously. Some examples are when he takes/knows the jawbones have magical properties but couldn't explain how he knows; and in the Dixie Pig when he speaks to Jake to get him moving - here especially there's no mention of Roland telling Eddie while they're in Maine that he contacted Jake telepathically nor was there much awareness of how the split up groups were doing, they seemed isolated and unaware of each other's progress, but that message could easily have come from a Roland sitting in the tower.

The continual perpetuation that such things are okay. 

Take this season's Mushoku Tensei. It's a pretty solid show for the most part, and I would love it were it not for the fact that the MC is a fucking degenerate. And I don't mean like, he's kinda pervy. He straight up copped a feel on a child to see her boob size then tried to take her panties off while she slept. This is a guy that got reincarnated as a newborn kid and is physically growing into a man. However, he still has the mind of a 40 year old dude. That is deplorable. And it's not even like in the show they ever try to make him feel shameful about it. It's just like, ""yeah this dude is a massive perv. This is the protagonist. Enjoy"". 

Now is this on the same par as the what goes on in Shield hero? No. Shield Hero is nowhere near as bad, but there's still a group of people that think the two should he a thing. Hell, the author in the WN and later the LN wants the same thing. 

&gt; I think we can all agree that Grogu(baby yoda) is still a child despite being hundreds of years old.

So I can only speak on what I know about Lil Greenie cuz I've only seen season 1. Yes. He's child. He acts like a child. When in that show or in the fandom has anyone tried to sexualize him or ship him with another character? No one has, cuz Lil Greenie looks and acts like a child.

Raphtalia looks like an adult, but in many ways acts like a child. You can say the whole ""kissing = pregnancy"" line was for laughs. It totally was. But it also establishes Raphtalia as being extremely innocent and unaware of more mature subjects.

&gt;She's well aware of how babies are made in the LN.

This doesn't matter in the slightest. You and I both know most people that watched Shield Hero probably haven't read the LN. They are two stand alone versions. One might portray Raphtalia as being more mature, but the other doesn't. The anime is what everyone sees and tends to talk about, so the anime is what matters in this discussion. 

And as for this...

"gn4t362","What you seem to really have a problem with is when a woman cuts through men’s bullshit and gives advice on doing so, esp when it effects whether or not newer SBs fall for these manipulative tactics as well. Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?

And again, are some men asking b/c they’re concerned about pregnancy scares — sure. And again, as I’ve mentioned *in my post &amp; in comments*, they’ll want to talk about it more if that’s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my &amp; other women’s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._

You like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it’s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you’re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. 

And simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it’s more honest to an extent, &amp; people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. 

But sure, let’s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men &amp; advocating for women &amp; who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it’s not even inaccurate*, because you don’t like... the approach? Because she’s not being polite &amp; apologetic enough when she does it? Because she’s not disclosing she’s on a second birth control method? Because you don’t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that’s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman’s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health &amp; safety &amp; lives at risk if we put our guards down.

"gmzs6eh","Hasn't the internet developed its own dialect of grammar to convey tone and purpose through different grammatical structures that aren't considered 'proper' in writing but can get a bunch more information across in less words?


Example:


no    =""No,"" she said plainly. 


Or...


NO!    = ""No!"" he shouted across the room. 


There's also the use of periods to consider where in a written language it is difficult to trailing words without adding extra letters to them. 


Example: 


Or...   Vs orrrrr


The first one implies the word is more drawn out without putting in extra letters, as well as looking neater and doesn't require knowledge that adding extra letters does not always make a new word (for those whose native language is not English). 



There are rules and structures that are commonly agreed upon by internet users to make vocal tone and intention of the comment easier to convey, even if not everyone knows that they know the meaning or is aware that there are differences. Of course on the internet you can ask and receive a timely answer. 


But that is also true in spoken conversation, not everyone is capable of picking out vocal tone or facial expressions to tell exactly what is being said. And we don't make accomdations for them either. 


But in real life if you ask you get looked at weirdly and told 'you should know this!' even if you really really have no clue whether someone was being serious or sarcastic and when you guess wrong they make weird noises and look at you like you've grown a third head. 


Also a lot of people use mobile and unaware of how to format it to not be a giant text wall


And if a word is spelled differently than normal then it has its own meaning in that spelling


Example: 


Smol     vs small

"gluw0zs","my man, I've read S&amp;R 3 times so far, I know it left to right, you are quotemining and skimming the book just to try to own me lmao. This conversation ""forced"" you to open the book? Read to try to understand Marxism man, not to make an argument.

&gt;How did you read about Kautsky and miss the sentence ""The state is the  organ of class rule""?

The state as an organ of class rule is indeed one if not the major characteristics of the state, but it isn't the unique feature to define the state. Lenin literally introduces the book with an Engels quote where he explains that the state is an apparatus that even though arises from society it stands/separates itself from it. This separation occurs in the positions of authority of the bureaucracy, the police and the standing army. 

This is the reason why the DOTP, even though remains an organ of class rule, it ceases to be a state in the full sense of the word. Because it abolishes those institutions. Lenin explains this thesis rather vaguely in S&amp;R, fortunately he wrote more thoroughly about it later:

&gt;Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises  *the need for a state* for the purpose of the transition to socialism; but (**and here is where we differ from Kautsky and Co**.)  ***not a state of the type*** **of   the usual parliamentary bourgeois-democratic republic, but a state  like  the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies of  1905  and 1917.**  
My third argument:  *living reality,*  the revolution, has  *already actually* established in our colmtry, **albeit in a weak and embryonic form**, precisely this new type of **“state”, which is not a state in the proper sense of the word.**  
This is  *already* a matter of the practical action of the people, and not merely a theory of the leaders.  
**The state in the proper sense of the term is domination over the people by contingents of armed men divorced from the people.**  
Our *emergent,*  new state is also a state, for we too need contingents of armed men, we too need the *strictest* order, and must  *ruthlessly* crush by force all attempts at either a tsarist or a Guchkov-bourgeois counter-revolution.  
But our  *emergent,*  new state is  *no longer* a state in the proper sense of the term, for in some parts of Russia **these contingents of armed men are** ***the masses themselves,*** **the   entire people, and not certain privileged persons placed over the   people, and divorced from the people, and for all practical purposes   undisplaceable.**  
We must look forward, and not backward to the usual bourgeois type of democracy, which **consolidated the rule of the bourgeoisie with the aid of tho old,** ***monarchist*** **organs of administration, the police, the army and the bureaucracy.**  
&gt;

&gt;And how did you managed to misinterpret ""but also  without the destruction of the apparatus of state power which was  CREATED BY THE RULING CLASS"" into ""let's have no state at all""? Lenin  was CLEARLY referencing the destruction of the Tzarist Russian state and  the provisional government state under Kerensky.. and is NOT against  the working class forming a state... which is the DoTP. 

It's not that hard to understand the point dog, I don't know what makes you miss the entire point. I guess all Kautskyists are this oblivious and unaware of their opportunism.

The proletarian destroys the state machine, establishes a state-commune consisting of the armed workers and this state-commune is what withers way. How is that hard to understand? 

If you read the passage I quoted above you would see that Lenin thought that this new state of the armed workers already existed in an embryonic form. And it would have kept growing with the economic transformation of Russia. This process was of course interrupted, due to mistakes and the circumstances of the time. Also the last sentence! What else do you need?!

&gt; None of this means anything and I have already debunked most of it. 

Yeah, by quotemining and control f-ing. What do you think of these passages? Help me understand them:

&gt; If the workers voluntarily unite their armed forces, this will be centralism, but it will be based on **the “complete destruction” of the centralized state apparatus—the standing army, the police, and the bureaucracy.** Kautsky acts like an outright swindler by evading the perfectly well­known arguments ofMarx and Engels on the Commune and plucking out a quotation which has nothing to do with the point atissue.   
&gt;  
&gt; Hence the need for all bourgeois parties, even for the most democraticand ""revolutionary­democratic"" among them, to intensify repressive measures against the revolutionaryproletariat, to strengthen the apparatus of coercion, i.e., the state machine. **This course of events compelsthe revolution ""to concentrate all its forces of destruction"" against the state power, and to set itself the aim,not of improving the state machine, but of smashing and destroying it.** 

Lenin also pointed out the cries of anarchism by the Kautskyists. Some things never change!

&gt; Marx agreed with Proudhon in that they both stood for the “smashing” of the modern state machine. **Neither the opportunists nor the Kautskyites wish to see the similarity of views on this point between Marxism and anarchism** (both Proudhon and Bakunin) because this is where they have departed fromMarxism.   
&gt;  
&gt;Addicts of hair­-splitting criticism, or bourgeois ""exterminators of Marxism"", will perhaps see acontradiction between this recognition of the ""abolition of the state"" and repudiation of this formula as ananarchist one in the above passage from Anti­Dühring. **It would not be surprising if the opportunists classed Engels, too, as an “anarchist”, for it is becoming increasingly common with the social­chauvinists to accuse the internationalists of anarchism.** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Neither of those texts say that the workers shouldn't defend themselves  against foreign aggression. Are you to imply that Lenin went against his  own theories? Like dude...

You absolutely just argued that knowing a knife is involved lowers the lethal risk, as you’re arguing knowing ahead of time changes the validity of responding with force.  It does not, because in both situations the risk and response is determined by proximity and intent of the person with the knife.

As someone who has volunteered in a mental health hospital for children there were so many other ways to handle this-

1. After she is cuffed she can't really do anything to harm anyone- distance away the crowd from her and have a single officer stay with her to be a temporary companion to stick with- make them her voice of reason that doesn't use any sort of force whatsoever. A ""good cop"" is actually useful.

2. don't rush anything and let her calm down- panic can sometimes make you blind and unaware of situations.

3. LISTEN. She clearly repeatedly calls out for her father which could mean she finds his presenceas a sign of safety- USE IT: ask her about her father, whay about him makes her call out to him? Try to understand why is she looking for that figure in this scary situation.

4. Even when she gets in the car don't just dump her there and drive- she is obviously in crisis and needs help, she clearly doesn't want to harm any of the officers and she is just pushing and kicking away because that's all she can do to prevent harm to her.

There are many more options amd actions that could have been done to help this poor child.

a.      To clarify, Lexi stated many times (even to me) that she wanted to be cremated and to have her ashes spread in the ocean.

In Houston, she had two people (that I heard of) who followed her and would leave items at her door. She also had people who would heckle her in and out of her apartment. They moved to a gated community to provide more safety for her. At one point, even in their gated community condo they had a situation with men following her and harassing her at the pool and they had to involve security. A police report was filed.

I would like to add that I am a trained victims’ advocate for victims of domestic abuse and I have been for years.  By actually being around Tom and Lexi, and spending time with them, I never saw signs of abuse or even a controlling side of Tom. Of course, I could have missed it – it is never cut and dry. However, there are usually some signs – even quiet ones – that are present and I never picked up any of those.  It is also uncommon for a spouse to go from no abuse to choking their partner out. It is interesting to me that that is the one detail she would tell her friends and not mention anything else. That is also not typical for an abusive situation…

"gl0n28m","I cannot answer your question since i am new to this trauma healing world. But i found your post really relatable to my experience.

 I was an extremely sensitive kid and since a young age used to cry incontrollably when i saw old photos of my younger self.The thing is that it also happened to me when i saw old photos of my parents when they were kids. 

 I remember myself thinking (way before i know what trauma or inner child meant) that i felt really sad and criying for the loss of inocence/joy of both my parents. It was as if in those pictures i could see a happier version of both of them that died somewhere along the path of their lives. And i was really feeling it.
Today i realise i was really sensing the pain of their inner children... tonight is one of those nights where i feel extremely compasionate for my dad (even if i cannot forgive him lots of things) and for what he had to suffer as a child. 

It is very strange but i was looking at a photo of my dad when he was around 4 or 5 and a photo of myself when i was a kid, both put one next to the other, and i felt an overwhelming sadness looking at them as if both innocent children were victims of their own circunstances. But there in the photos they both look so pure and unaware of all the suffering...

What makes all of this so complicated for me is the fact that our abusers were also victims in a similar way we were, with the exception that they may have developed a different coping response... And since we are compasionate people we cannot avoid feeling very sad and sorry for them... which makes everything so complicated. I find myself in an emotional rollercoaster where sometimes feel anger towards him but some other times an overwhelming compassion that makes me cry.

"gkgw0zl","My wording could have been better, but she said  ""My mom remarried when i was 13"". So since she and her step-sister are the same age, I'm assuming that her step-dad hadn't married and divorced within the 13 years. Meaning that she spent 13 years with only 1 parent. This lead me to assume that she grew up with one parent

If you think that assumption is too much, then fair enough, I can't back that up, but I think it's unlikely for someone to marry &amp; divorce and then remarry within that time period.

Plenty of people grow up with one parent and come out just fine, this is true. However, there are also plenty of people who grow up with one parent and don't come out fine. I'm not trying to say that everyone with one parent must be damaged in someway. The point I am trying to make is that having one parent is often a disadvantage, taxing to say the least.  Unless you want to suggest that this isn't true, I'm not sure what your intention is when you say ""Plenty of people grow up with one parent and come out just fine"".

That being said, as I said in my original comment, this doesn't justify the step-sister's ridiculous behavior...

Finally, in the heat of the moment I think I might behave similarly, saying she should be ashamed or worse. However, this almost certainly isn't the correct decision and we should try to not do this or be proud that we might do this.

When you tell someone to be ashamed, very rarely will they actually be ashamed. Usually doing so will just direct their anger towards you and force them to double down on their position. This is going to be more true if it comes from a stranger such as you or I. The reason I tell her to talk to her parents when things have calmed down is because she can have a proper conversation about the problem. In the heat of the moment, she and everyone else probably aren't in a position to carefully consider the problem and come up with solutions. In that moment, her parents may be angry, irrational and unaware of many things. By talking in a ""peaceful"" moment her Dad/mom might recant many statements.

If they continue treat her in an unfair or dismissive manner then that would speak to their normal mindset and beliefs instead of their emotional mindset and beliefs and from that we can make a much harsher judgement on character rather than impulse.",1611446797,"in that moment, her parents may be angry, irrational and unaware of many things.","irrational and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"irrational and unaware","irrational",NA,NA,0

If one of your chief competitors and enemies wanders into your territory, without any backup, you’d take that chance to take him out. That’s one less competitor.

Orgasms do not equal enjoyment or pleasure; it's a natural reaction to stimulation and the mere fact that she tried to tell you you liked it all because you remained erect and reached climax shows how little she knows on the matter.

I hope she's simply ignorant and unaware of the things I stated being factual and not just denying it's truth.

I'm also a bit bothered by how she's clearly not on your side but just blindly believing everything this guy is saying which is basically invalidating you feeling violated and blackmailed.

"gjj1c5l","Yes, I share your perspective as well.
I've done a lot of personal research about neuroscience and all the latest discoveries in regards to the human brain and it's components and functionality.


I did this mostly out of necessity ever since I began to develope a lot of psychological issues that made me very vigilant of how to better handle my emotional volatility and cognitive  impairments and some of the things I learned completely changed my general outlook on our human nature and our conscience experiences.

 I recently reached a point where I feel as though I have completely mastered my ability to regulate emotions and enhance my cognition through different mental practices such as meditation, active discipline techniques akin to forced cold exposure, breathing exercises, brain games and so on.

My own insights and revelations guided by the scientific knowledge I have gained have done wonders and I cant even imagine how much the benefits of new medical procedures alongside the self imposed lifestyle changes will have in the future.
However, another one of my concerns is that I notice all to much how little the general populace actually care about educating themselves about the scientific aspects of the reality they live in, especially in regards to their own biology and physiology and how they can essentially hack those factors that may seem initially impossible to change.

Although, I do understand apart of that problem is due to the neglected parts of the public educational institutions that the governments infrastructure has set up that makes people almost despise learning because they make it so tedious and forced.
But if people cared just a fraction more about learning and being informed the world would be exponentially a better place but their is no initiative to learn things other than financial motive to not be in debt or homeless and that's not how it should be whatsoever.

Personally I also believe that there are ways to better distribute resources to scientific fields of interest to improve the acceleration rate of progress even further but Im also realistically minded in the sense that I understand that it would probably be impossible to employ because most people won't band together to put too much of a emphasis on the STEM fields because they care too much about living a leisurely life and just enjoying the entertainment aspects of society not realizing that if they boy cot certain industries and corporations in favor of allocating more resources to scientific and technological developments that their capacity to ""enjoy life to the fullest"" will be much more accessible and the notion that in order to be happy you have to retire in your late 60s after years of pain staking labor and sacrifices and the occasional weekend shenanigans that are entirely too superficial anyways. 

But people are way to short sighted and that once again loops back to the fact that they are so completely uneducated and unaware of the true reality of their lives.

Basically after this rambling I'm just trying to say if the more influencial people could find a better way to motivate the younger generation of kids to focus on self education rather than just following the publicly accepted template of traditional brick and mortar schooling programs then they would find  success not only for themselves but for the rest of society as well because they will eventually have preferential  satisfaction in finding the answers to lifes toughest questions rather than trying to impress people with their style, rap skills, basketball skills and etc. 

I understand that not everyone will have my exact perspective but I only say this because I used to be like all the other kids who looked up to athletes, actors, musicians for my inspirations  in life but after doing some real critical thinking after not being tought in school I realized how little those types of people actually contributed to society and that's when I realized the true value of STEM. 

I just think people's priorities are really misaligned with what they say their motives are for helping and contributing to society as a whole and I blame it mostly on the combination of governmental ordinances, medias influence and the perpetual reinforcement of traditional morals and direction of lifestyle choices from previous generations that couldn't see far enough into the future and the potential it holds just through some short term sacrifices and proper motivations.",1610846843,"but people are way to short sighted and that once again loops back to the fact that they are so completely uneducated and unaware of the true reality of their lives.","uneducated and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"completely uneducated and unaware","uneducated",NA,"completely",0

My issue with Leva and this storyline is that Leva is NOT calling Kathryn out because of racism.  She is not continuing to attack Kathryn at every moment and break up her friendships because she is so concerned about Kathryn's racism. She is doing all this because she hates Kathryn over what happened with her friend Cameron.  Period.

https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/asymptomatic-transmission-of-covid-19-didnt-occur-at-all-study-of-10-million-findsz

However, the new study in Nature Communications, titled “Post-lockdown SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening in nearly 10 million residents of Wuhan, China,” debunked the concept of asymptomatic transmission. 
It stated that out of the nearly 10 million people in the study, “300 asymptomatic cases” were found. Contact tracing was then carried out and of those 300, no cases of COVID-19 were detected in any of them. “A total of 1,174 close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative for the COVID-19.”


&gt;Your bottom link brought up the math in part 2 that if 60% of people wore a mask that prevented 60% of the covid carrying saliva from reaching other people then each carrier on average would infect roughly the same or slightly less people over time.

&gt; At the start this was to ""flatten the curve"" to prevent hospitals from being overloaded.

Its similar to vaccines or herd immunity as they also prevent a person from infecting more people through having less people to interact with that could still be infected.  While masks should instead lower how many people a person would infect on average

In theory, the Material is the easiest to conquer because it's not as united as the other planes are. But every other plane knows this, so they're fighting a proxy war. Whoever claims the material plane, claims the multiverse, and all the major powers know this.

Most humanoids are Unaligned. They have no stake in The War for the Multiverse, and most are unaware that there's anything going on.

All wars are just skirmishes and campaigns within The War.

This informs how I do tiers of play. Tier 1 characters are unaligned, and unaware of The War. Tier 2 are aware of good/evil/chaotic/lawful factions vying for power. Tier 3 sees that all of these factions represent the other planes, and are fighting on their behalf in The War.

"giyayx7","Coincidentally, this Shatner/Takei kerfuffle and the disgruntlement of other Trek cast members came up for discussion recently in a Facebook Trek group. Because I think it is sufficiently ""on point, and to save my typing fingers, here is how I responded then:

A few points come to mind.

Reading through the exhaustively researched volumes of These are the Voyages (Season one, two, and three), by Marc Cushman, you will find comments from people that show a full range of reactions to working with Shatner (and Nimoy, and even Kelley), from those who loved the experience to those who did not.

I love the Trek characters \*and\* the cast members who played them, but when I first heard, some decades ago, about these complaints from the other cast members, my initial thought was that they had forgotten what business they were in.

For one thing, this show was not filmed in the era of the ensemble cast show. You had the stars and the supporting cast. The stars got the most (screen time, lines, money). That's simply the way it was. For another, post-Trek, all the cast members (""stars"" and otherwise) had issues of typecasting to deal with that impacted their careers. This also was not unusual—then or now.

Another major factor is that during the course of making each episode, there were multiple drafts of each script. The revisions and changes often resulted in scenes/lines being reduced, cut out entirely, etc. The Cushman books show examples of this. It might be due to the input of the showrunners, to input from cast members, to limitations of budget and/or technology, to network oversight, etc. Yes, Shatner had his input, but so did other cast members.

But all the supporting cast could see was their parts being whittled down, rewrite by rewrite.

However, there were never any public reports of disharmony on the set, and off the set and even post-Trek, everyone was always one big happy family. So it does not surprise me that none of this unhappiness came to light until many years later (after Roddenberry's passing). To Shatner's credit, although he had been totally oblivious and unaware of any of it, he did not sweep it under the rug. He reported on it in his own books.

Now, if Trek had not become the phenomenon that it did, at the end of the series everyone would have gone their own way, dealt with their various careers (and maybe even without the typecasting burden that success brings), and likely thought no more about any of this.

But that didn't happen. Instead we got convention after convention after convention. Where all the cast members—main, supporting, guest, etc.—were lauded and cheered and applauded (rightfully so). 

That was bound to have an effect, too, because knowing that across the country there were people making it clear that they would have loved to have seen more of your character and your performance . . . Well, if I were in that situation, I would start to feel hard done by. 

Which does not, however, make their lack of screen time the fault of a single individual. 

In the end, none of us were there and cannot report first-hand, and I for one got tired of hearing about this silly ""feud"" right from the beginning. Settle it like gentlebeings and leave the rest of us out of it.",1610415742,"to shatner's credit, although he had been totally oblivious and unaware of any of it, he did not sweep it under the rug.","oblivious and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"totally oblivious and unaware","oblivious",NA,"totally",0

Yeah, relative to what happened in major cities during BLM, the police did practically fucking nothing to prevent businesses from being looted and destroyed. I was at one of the largest BLM protests during the second week it kicked off (yes, they smashed windows and lit things on fire later that night). My neighboring city has one of the largest police forces in the country. If they were able to control such events, they would have stomped it all out the first night it got violent rather than letting it persist for months and months. My state’s governor refused to call the National Guard as part of a political measure to stick it to Trump. This went on *for months.* You will find isolated snippets from social media of protestors getting beaten, but compared to how long the protests lasted versus how relatively sparingly this occurred, the law enforcement response was notoriously nonexistent. 

Yes, the corporate press wanted you to think the Arab Spring and Euromaiden were a unanimous good. You had all the usual media actors and the think tanks and such hailing the capacity of Twitter for social change and the prevailing of soft power over autocracy, what have you. You have to be *committed* to being completely milquetoast and unaware of the greater picture to have not noticed this. 

You give people too much of the benefit of the doubt regarding lusting for violence against their perceived enemies. Yes, many of those tweeting out “why weren’t they all shot” would probably have reveled in such a response, though that could be our likely differing perspectives of human nature at play.

No, I don’t have to concede the actions this summer were inevitable or justifiable. That’s despicable, stupid bullshit. Some guy makes more money than me, so I’m okay to just go torch his house?

While both of these are negative, the reactions and feelings towards them would not realistically be the same. It seems there’s really not ceiling as to how far someone can go and still be presented as sympathetic. Which is a problem. Aside from it not making sense, I would question what kind of person is writing this story, who feels objectively that her actions are excusable?

It’s in theory okay to include that, but they need to consider that Warcraft’s generalized morals are based on our own. Are there differences? Yes. But on the whole, what’s considered good there is considered bad out here in real life. Killing an innocent? Bad. Giving money to the poor? Good.

Sometimes when people mention my weight I feel like asking, “Why do you care”?

This is the year that I’m trying to get rid of my disordered eating for good.  I relapsed once yesterday and weighed myself and saw that I was up 2lbs which is probably water weight.  My day was ruined yesterday because of the scale.  Today, I went back to not weighing myself again.  Also, I’m trying so hard not to count calories.  

I have been restricting and watching what I eat since age 10.  People have been commenting on my weight since age 5.  Both of my grandmas and my parents and some of my aunties used to tease me as a small child for being “fat”.  I started puberty at an early age and also received negative comments for that.  By the age of 9 I felt so much shame, disgust, and disappointment about my body.  

I am at the point where I am sick and fed up with body comments.  People have commented on my weight when I’ve gained just 2-5lbs from my period.  It’s damn annoying.  Honesty, I never ever mention my weight, diet, and size to others.   Ever.  Even as a small child I was so innocent and unaware of my body until ignorant adults pointed it out.

"ghs7j2q","You seem to be very thorough in your research, asking clarification from many individuals, which is an admirable trait in a writer. I've tried to answer your questions below. Feel free to private message if you'd like.

**Stimming vs Repetitive Behaviours**

Stimming is a repetitive behaviour that is used to produce a certain sensation. Rocking (for vestibular input), hand flapping or walking on toes (for tactile input), vocalizations or tongue clicking (for auditory input), and looking at colourful or moving objects are commonly cited examples (although somewhat stereotypical).

Repetitive behaviours in general may not produce any unique or continuous stimulation, but feel just as necessary. This is like when we watch the same show or listen to the same song multiple times in a row, or repeat the same task many times. I get this with cleaning a lot (which lead to initial suspicions of OCD) for example where I will rinse a dish 7 times before putting it away. I also count repeatedly to 10 while completing tasks, say the same prayer repeatedly -- this is sacrilegious in my religion -- (usually sets of four now, used to be sets of forty nine), look at the corners of a room (usually sets of five), and have a very intricate pattern for how to walk on sidewalks ""correctly"".

**Biological and Sensory Differences**

Autistic individuals have /many/ biological differences, even though they cannot be diagnosed by any of them. We react differently to medication (pain medicine/sedatives are less effective on some of us and we are much more likely to experience side effects of any medication). One common difference seems to be an inverse reaction to stimulants or sedatives (stimulants calming a person or sedatives increasing their energy). We also very frequently have digestive or motor issues.

As for processing issues, auditory and tactile processing seem to pose the most difficulty for the largest population. Many complain that it is difficult to isolate sounds or ignore sounds, or to understand multiple speakers. Tactile issues are generally tactile sensitivities, where certain textures or soft-touch are very uncomfortable or even painful. I generally find that my muscles tense and I often shudder after touching certain things. This is where the complaint about clothes tags generally comes from.

I am tactile seeking, and have PTSD, so in my case I must /constantly/ have new tactile input in order to maintain any order to my thoughts or awareness of my surroundings. I usually manage this through constant tactile stims (even while sleeping). If I stop for more than a few seconds and don't have an external source of stimulation I start going numb and my breathing slows to a near stop. I also become unaware of sounds around me and visual processing issues get /much/ worse. Visual thoughts start racing (flashes of dozens of random images simultaneously) and I may be completely numb and unaware of everything for about 30 minutes. If this happens while I'm asleep, I wet the bed. -\_-\* Which is why I can only have sheets made from coarse materials.

**Diagnosis Methods**

As for the diagnosis, it is probably best not to mention /how/ the character knows they are autistic. It includes the self diagnosed community, without confronting the issue. Self diagnosis is valid for community involvement, but if the self-diagnosed has the ""everyone's a little autistic"" attitude it may erode the credibility of other self-diagnosed individuals.

P.S. I found these comics helpful when I was waiting for my diagnostic results.

"ghfag9u","No downvotes, but I do think you may be quite new to the game and unaware of some things, so let me address them.

&gt;you constantly have to go back to heal every 2 or so trainer fights is problematic

People who say this are generally doing one of the following things:

* Catching too many temtem too early, and spreading around the xp gains over too many temtem, keeping them all at low levels instead of focusing on a good core team

* New and unaware of synergy, weaknesses, and stats. For example, did you know that whenever you catch a temtem, from then on, when battling against it, you will get a red/white/green circle that tells you if you'll do half/1x/2x damage? Do you know how to use synergy to hit harder with attacks? Did you find the coward's cloak (xp share) on the first island? Did you explore all the areas to find the extra hidden battles to get xp? I don't know how you play, but this game isn' t rushable, and I generally hear your types of posts from rushers.

&gt;kinu, I pretty much have no good grass special attacks and it's a special attacker

Kinu is primarily played as a healer, special attack is just a nice bonus. Kinu is also already ridiculously OP in PvP, virtually an insta ban.

&gt;Your starter shouldn't need to go to 55 in order to reach its max form for no payoff compared to other temtem that evolve quicker.

Again, this reads like someone who hasn't played to endgame or PvP, because the starter finals are amazing and worth the effort. The mental starter's final is meta-defining. I like the way they do it- it makes more sense that they'd evolve based on time spent with you, not a fixed level.

&gt;Lastly, I think the biggest issue is a lack of a clear goal with the end game.

They released a roadmap so I don't think it could be much clearer. To be fair, the map has changed due to covid, but you can see what they intend to add.

&gt;There is no point to the sv system right now if they scale in competitive

"ghdul4r","Thank you for sharing what you think!

I'll explain why I said they want to be ignorant. Like you said, people are choosing to lie and cover for their idols over the truth just to prevent fanwars. That's already alarming in itself for the whole kpop community. Why did I say fans want to be ignorant? Well, they do know what's going on like you said, but they either pretend to not know or they wish they really didn't know what bad things their fave has done (I was like this too), so the closest thing to actually being unaware is to cover the evidence, make up excuses/lies to cover for your idol so that others catch on to that, and if you lie enough, it'll eventually feel like it's true. 

I don't know how to describe it, but it's like tricking yourself and those around you to justify what your idol did was ok, since they \*insert excuse\*, and then that leads to you excusing and forgetting about what other idols have done. 

I can understand why they do it. They want to see the good in their idol, and you'll feel guilty if you still like and support them, even if they did something bad, so they're trying to comfort themselves in a way. So, that is why I believe so many want to be completely ignorant and unaware of what's going on, but sometimes they will be forced to understand the truth, so they try their best to make up for it by lying, excuses, and justifying to make themselves feel better, and in turn their idol's image stays in-tact for the most part.

I stay away from Twitter (that place is just.....no lol) so I am not completely aware of what happens there anymore, but I am not surprised there are still fights happening..

It's sad that people get shut down for calling out their idols. I feel like this happens because of what I previously said in this reply and kpop fans are so used to playing a game of war where you either have to be offensive or defensive, and you get caught up in that energy. So many kpop fans are young, so it's hard getting to them. 

I am not sure how many people actually do care out there, but it's kind of hard to show when the fandom is like this. I am just going to see what happens in the future when Black kpop fans have enough of being offended and disrespect, so they leave, and non-Black kpop fans are tired of the scandals and seeing their idols do this, so they also leave. I doubt it'll happen any time soon, but who knows.

"ghcpe7y","You're suffering from a systematic failure of your thought processes, I'm afraid.

1) You don't even know the most basic principles of linguistics - like that transmission speed is non-arbitrary, but rather regulated by human biology - and yet you think you can improve on it. This means you are suffering very badly from the Dunning-Kruger Effect - that is to say, you are incompetent and unaware of it. You lack even the most basic knowledge about language, and yet you are proposing sweeping changes to it.

2) You claim that it is wrong to advantage one thing over another, and yet you want to change language in order to suit yourself, not other people. This is a sign of narcissism - you don't even recognize how selfish and self-centered you're being, while crying about other people suggesting that it would be less bother to simply adopt the language of the dominant culture as a universal secondary language.

3) Language changes organically over time in order to better suit people's needs. You complained about prescriptionists, and yet you are a prescriptionist yourself - you simply complain about other people defending things *you* personally want changed. This means you have no actual stance but ""I want to get what I want,"" which, again, points towards narcissism.

4) Likewise, the reason why lingua francas change is precisely because of changing real world circumstances - Latin was very important when Rome was the center of the world, but today it is a dead language, and new languages have arisen and evolved. English is constantly adopting new words and creating new words in order to suit changing needs, which is precisely why many languages are being influenced by English - because English creates a bunch of new words, other languages must either create their own or adopt the English one. Many adopt the existing one because it already exists, for much the same reason why we call tacos and enchiladas those names, rather than make up new ""English"" names for them - they are things that exist, why not keep their name consistent, if there's no need to invent a new one? Indeed, this is one of the reasons why English is so successful at spreading - because it is useful not just for communicating with English speakers, but communicating complex technical ideas.

&gt; If sexual promiscuity is so bad then it's strange that monogamous relationships keep getting broken apart by it and also that when divorce was legalized for the first it resulted in an incredible number of shattered homes.

Rape is bad. That doesn't mean that people don't commit rape, it means that people do bad things.

Maybe try actually thinking next time.

The reason why we look down on the sexually promiscuous is to discourage sexual promiscuity, because stable two-person households have much better outcomes.

Fun fact: almost every bullshit statistic you hear about how OMG MILLENIALS HAVE IT TOUGH is a lie based on this.

For instance, Millennials have ""lower"" home ownership rates. However, this is actually false in a very significant way; millennials who are married are *more* likely to own homes than previous generations were. In fact, this is true of unmarried millennials as well.

However, because fewer millennials have married, this results in lower homeownership amongst millennials, because unmarried people are less likely to own their own homes.

Permanent pair bonded couples provide greater financial stability and more resources, as you can pool resources between two people and share housework, lowering overall upkeep costs. Living in a stable two-income household results in more investment in capital goods, goods that keep on giving, like home ownership.

Moreover, children raised in stable two-parent households have significantly better outcomes than those raised in single parent homes or those where the parental situation is unstable.

Creating a societal expectation for this sort of behavior results in better societal outcomes.

One of the major reasons why black youth are disadvantaged is because 70% of them are raised by single parents.

If you want to have kids, you need to create a stable home situation, preferably with two incomes.

And if you don't, well, what are you doing to contribute to the future of society instead?

&gt; You think this is clever &amp; valid because you don't imagine that you'll ever be on the wrong side of it, but let's imagine that you're a straight white man (not hard to imagine in this case) and a bunch of other straight white men start calling you ""gay"" or a slur based on your perceived homosexuality.

I've been mistaken for gay, for female, and numerous other things over my lifetime. Why would I even care? It's not like it's an insult, it's just people being wrong.

If you're so insecure you fly off the handle when people make mistakes like that, there's something wrong with you.

Someone who is calling me a ""faggot"" is obviously just trying to rile me up, and in a very pathetic, juvenile sort of way. I don't really see why I'd be that worried about some troglodyte doing so. I've been called worse.

It's not hard to deal with that sort of thing.

Yeah, you don't respect other people, and are fundamentally incapable of empathy.

"gh49sy1","Uh no, because in large parts of Ireland (particularly the six Northern counties) the teaching of the Irish language was prohibited in certain communities, repressed in others and subject to centuries of socio-political turmoil including recently bringing the govt of Northern Ireland down over the Irish Language Act.

In fact it was such a big fucking deal that Republic of Ireland declared independence from 800 years of British colonialisation, the island was split, several wars were fought and you have heard of The Troubles which was one of the longest running civil wars worldwide. The Irish language was highly weaponised there.

As a Protestant kid in Northern Ireland during the conflict I was banned from bringing any Irish language book into school. Something as basic as a book of folk tales or the Children of Lir was forbidden. We were prohibited from learning Irish at school and the division between communities was so strong that I could not have gone to a predominantly Catholic Irish class without breaking the fucking time space continuum and having to cross the peace wall multiple times on a bus, run the gauntlet of explaining to the boyos in that area why the hoods in my area had let me out unattended and then get screamed at back home for talking to Catholics or the soldiers who would have invariably stopped me as I skipped across Belfast wondering why our buses didn’t say an lar and why City Hall took six years of wrangling to write buscar or bin in Irish on our city centre bins. Turns out it was shade by anti Irish language Unionists that the only bilingual thing in the city official was where you put rubbish...

I then moved to England where everyone thought I was a terrorist, was unaware the Brits were the colonial force that kicked it all off, had no idea not all Irish people are Catholic and wanted me to pronounce all the Irish names.

Well funnily enough I don’t know how to pronounce them after decades of being kept away from any Irish language, sport or culture to prove we were more British than the British. It is a really fucking sore spot for me to have been denied that connection as a child and then mocked by English people for not speaking Irish which they continually slag off as such a weird impossible to pronounce language and continue to perpetuate a lot of unpleasant anti Irish sentiment about.

20 years in England and I’m seen as Irish but back home I’m not Irish enough. It’s shit and stressful and honestly I hate the subject of Irish names here for this reason. Someone’s always getting on my back for not being good enough and forgetting the context.

My parents picked an Irish name for me and were told in 1978 that none of the Protestant schools would allow me to be registered with it because segregated schooling is such an issue there along religious lines. So instead of a beautiful centuries old name unique to Ireland, they called me the most boring girls name of the year and still got shit for even considering a ‘Celtic’ name. My parents are Scottish and Northern Irish FYI.

Names are a huge cultural sore spot for the Irish diaspora especially and I think OP was correct on first go but started to go very wrong when she dug in without a wider awareness of what Irish language discourse was 40 years ago.

That’s around the time Margaret Thatcher was taking NI to the brink over the hunger strikes, to have an Irish name in England was enough to get you barred from opening a bank account or taking a tenancy and still a perfectly justifiable reason to fit you up for a miscarriage of justice a la Birmingham Six or Guildford Four or Maguire Seven. They used to say Irish names were like football scores back in those days they were so likely to lead to false convictions.

"gh3qzis","Hanekawa is a person who repress her negative emotions deep within her, not even acknowledging they exist, and only showing her ""purest/whitest"" side to others.

The sawari neko is an aberration that feeds on positive emotions, most specifically compassion. When people encounter a dead cat on the road, they either ignore it or bury it out of compassion. However Hanekawa did it, not out of compassion, but as an automatic mechanism as if it was something normal.

Usually the Sawari neko takes control of their host who showed compassion when burying him, however in this case it couldn't take control of Hanekawa since she didn't show compassion in the first place. So it was stuck within her, forced to feed on the negative emotions she's bottled up. 

At this point in time, Hanekawa ends up being split in 2. The Hanekawa that Araragi knows/sees : the perfect class president, who he heavily sexualizes in Kizu. And Black Hanekawa, the oddity that feeds on Hanekawa's negative emotions she hides from everybody and even herself.

However people aren't just black and white, they're shades of grey. One side cannot live without the others. So for your questions :

1. The oddity instead of controlling Hanekawa completely, because of her lack of compassion, ends up being part of the split personality of Hanekawa. So it's not a traditionnal sawari neko but a new kind because it made the mistake of choosing Hanekawa as a host. And when this side of Hanekawa was awaken, the ""white"" side of Hanekawa was sleeping so technically unconcsious and unaware of the situation.
2. When Araragi tells Hanekawa that he hates her, he's talking about Black Hanekawa, because he believes that the oddity is taking over Hanekawa and therefore causing her trouble, and he hates that it makes Hanekawa, who's perfect in his head, look bad. He hates her ""dark/black"" side, thinking that it's only due to the oddity and if it never appeared, none of this would have happened. However these emotions were only bottled up for so long and only exploded once the cat fed on them. But Araragi doesn't see it that way.

Again, this is just my opinion, but to me the wording of the proclamation implies that each person will know whether they are a son or daughter and that won’t change which makes it really hard for transgender or intersex people to know if they are going against God or not as they try to live in the Church.

"ggsf399","In ‘the beginning’, as it were, awareness was dull and unaware of its own nature. This is the “connate” ignorance, because it is connate with awareness from the beginning.

When appearance arose, ‘some’ awareness correctly identified the nature of appearance as not being dualistically separate from itself. It gained insight into the nature of mind and thereby lost the connate ignorance. This is the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra.

‘Other’ awareness mistakenly viewed appearance as being dualistically separate—it viewed itself as a subject and appearance as external objects, as we do. This is the “imputing ignorance”, because it imputes duality into experience. This imputing ignorance is the basis of entering samsara.

When you become enlightenment, you achieve the same enlightenment as Samantabhadra, eliminating both the imputing and connate ignorance. Without the connate ignorance, there is no basis for the imputing ignorance and therefore samsara to arise again.

College educated Wilson Tang is an anomaly in the way that he operates successfully in an Asian enclave, but not an anomaly when it comes to using that success to funnel his lifestyle in accordance to white supremacy ideals that a lot of individual Asians aspire to do.

Apologies for any mistakes, I’m on mobile and this is my first time writing 

I (25f) currently work as a vet tech at a local family owned animal hospital. I started there October 2019 and they were short staffed even then, Covid hit shortly after and even more people were unable to work. Everybody works 4 ten hour days so there’s always a day with somebody missing, I work until 2 pm everyday. The hospital has only had to shut down for one day since this all started and the appointments have not stopped coming in, there are exams booked out weeks in advance and the wait list is long. We hired Debra (60f) in July 2020 and Andy (30sm)in November. 

I’m an easygoing person and I get along well with everyone including the other techs, doctors, receptionists, and the kennel attendant, but Debra drives me nuts. 

She’s genuinely a nice person and works earnestly but she’s also constantly undermining me, questioning my decisions, and doing the wrong thing at the wrong time so I end up doing a majority of the treatment work while she does laundry or fills prescriptions. 
She’s also very slow and unaware of what’s happening on the schedule. 

Debra has been a tech for longer than I have (which is admittedly not very long), but there are concerning gaps in her technical skills and medical knowledge. She’s terrible with blood draws and injections, she doesn’t know how to do cystocentesis (using an ultrasound and a really long needle to get a sterile urine sample through the bladder) or shoot good x-rays, can’t enter charges and labs properly, and I’ve been bitten while she was restraining an animal. It’s been five months and I still feel like I have to babysit her and hold her hand through the simplest tasks because I can’t trust the quality of her work. I’ve brought up my concerns with management a few times but nothing much has changed. I also feel bad because she’s older and does need a little more time with certain tasks. I try my best to focus on my own work and I try not to care about whatever she’s doing but her mistakes can affect the flow of the entire day. 

I don’t like finding myself adopting an “I don’t care” attitude and I accepted a new job as an ER tech today and gave my notice. Me leaving will significantly impact my current hospital since I work closely with the practice owner/DVM and tech for a majority of her exams, I also monitor surgeries and dentals on certain days. I know I don’t have an obligation to stay but vet med is a tight knit community. 

I feel bad for leaving in the middle of a pandemic because I don’t want to work with Debra anymore. AITA

"ggi24g6","Imagine two layers of thought with a line between them.

* The underlying uncontrolled acting processes.
* The understanding one has of the way they behave and who they are.

The fact a person is trans, assuming that the source for this lies in the first layer, would be that there is something hard-wired into your mind that says ""I should expect to have the body of X"" but in reality you have the body of Y and the mismatch causes distress.

You observe this mismatch and it leads you to conclude that you are trans or perhaps more specifically that you are a person who desires to have the body of X.

The self-modeling only kicks in as a concept when the parts of your uncontrolled-acting-process layer adjust, or when something about your physical or mental features, that you understand to be ""you"" change.

During a physical change one of a number of things can happen.

* In the case that your understanding of this feature being yourself was learned, grief then resolution, as your sense of self adjusts to match your new physical appearance.
* In the case that the feeling of ""x should be y"" is innate, grief and no resolution.  After some time, you are forced to eventually conclude that this aspect of desire is ""part of you"" and you try to adjust your physical body to cope.
* There's also some room for it to to be learned, but also baked in hard enough it can't change, which is akin to the second situation but gives some future wiggle room for resolution as our understanding of the mind/therapy/etc evolves and advances.  Imagine someone at the age of 60 gets their legs chopped off and never stops trying to stand up out of bed, but someone at the age of 15 sees that expectation fade.

Your sense of self is almost certain to be learned and discovered, and flexible as a result.  There was almost certainly a time, for example, before you were trans that you still had all the feelings you have now, but were confused and unaware of what to do with them.

This is less a question of if being trans indicates your sense of self should determine who you are, and more a question of what does or does not lie above/below that line of learned/flexible self-traits and innate/understood traits.

&gt;the sense of self directs the other compartments of the brain to achieve its goals

I think this is going to be something that turns out to be a huge oversimplification.  I already know, off the top of my head, that there's strong evidence that your ""self"" does spend a decent chunk of time repressing action rather than creating or directing.  The parts of your mind are always deciding to act, and your decision to act is often the process of allowing those actions to occur.

Say you come up with a new idea.  Do you come up with the new idea?  If you aren't your mind, no, your brain comes up with an idea and you're made aware of it.  That doesn't seem right to me.

I think this idea of self, to look at awareness rather than the actual production of thought (or a mix of the two) reduces what the ""you"" is and is not going to hold up with time.

The idea there is a thinking and experiencing part of your mind controlling all the other parts is convenient for tulpamancy, but that it is so should lead to question why you choose to believe it.  How much of your belief there is driven by your desire to see tulpamancy backed up, over an honest evaluation of what you think is likely to be true?",1608487916,"there was almost certainly a time, for example, before you were trans that you still had all the feelings you have now, but were confused and unaware of what to do with them.","confused and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"confused and unaware","confused",NA,NA,0

"ggcabyf","&gt; Your response seems to be trying to defend your own personal emotional response to the game.

As is yours. That's how discussion works. People have different emotional responses to a media, they discuss why they feel a certain way and why they disagree with how others felt.

&gt;The game objectively didn't work for a lot of people, and engendered a negative reaction from many of them, and there are a bunch of reasons why that is the case.

And it also worked for a lot of people, and engendered a positive reaction from many of them, and there are a bunch or reasons why that is the case. Yet you only focus on the negative reactions and pretend that it's the majority consensus when that's factually incorrect. It's mixed at worst, positive at best, based on sales and completion rates.

You continuously asserting that most people hated it based on anecdotes and against the actual numbers is an attempt to justify your own dislike of the game. You seem to have hard time comprehending the idea that a lot of people actually liked this game so you pretend they don't exist or are in the minority despite no evidence. Mainly because you seem to rely on the argumentum ad populum defense frequently, and thus acknowledging the large fanbase would contradict your idea that the game was bad.

&gt;It isn't good vs bad. It's whether or not it weakens the impact of the work for a section of the audience - which it does.

And my argument has been that it doesn't. The restriction of agency is necessary for telling the story, as is with a lot of stories (including most video games). 

&gt;You think you can disagree with their emotional response, but it doesn't work that way. They understood the work just fine. It didn't work for them for the reasons I pointed out.

I never said they were wrong for having their opinions, I said the opposite in fact. I said it was fine for them to dislike the game and that people have different tastes. Art is subjective, people will have varying reactions to different works of art and have different levels of tolerance for what they find or don't find acceptable. This discussion has been about *why* and how the arguments presented by people who didn't like the game are unconvincing don't hold up to scrutiny from my perspective, and you have been asserting that they do according to your perspective.

&gt;Railroading can and does weaken the emotional impact of a lot of things like this in games. If the player tries to avoid doing something, but is railroaded into it by the game, it does weaken the emotional impact of that bit.

Of course it *can*, that doesn't mean it *always* does. In fact, railroading can often enhance the emotional impact of a story. I could go through a bunch of different games, but let's use one as an example. FF7 where Aerith gets killed. Completed scripted, unavoidable, and considered by many to be one of the most emotionally impactful moments in gaming. 

Part of what made it so impactful was because of the lack of player agency. If the player had the option to drop-kick Sephiroth and teabag him, would that have made the scene more emotionally powerful? Would the story have been made better by that addition? Or if the player could just walk around in the background and do silly dances while Aerith was dying, would that have made it better? It would have added player agency.

Or let's go back to Spec Ops. You say that the lack of choice weakens the story, when it actually enhances it. The core of the story is about how broken the ""war hero"" style of video game narrative is. The main character thinks he's a great hero, repeatedly does terrible things, then justifies the terrible things by saying it's for some nebulous greater good or ignoring it because ""there's no way I could be the bad guy."" He's a hypocrite, and the player experiences this as the character does, the difference being that the player eventually starts realizing it. This story, its message, and its emotional impact would be weakened or outright destroyed if you could just circumvent all of that.

And I know what you're going to say. ""It's about how you do it."" But my entire point for TLOU2 is that it does it right. The story and its emotional beats wouldn't work if the player could just do whatever they wanted. 

On top of that, increasing the agency of the player controlling the main character weakens the main character. It's a trade-off. The main character has to become more of a blank slate the more agency you give the player in order to justify the differences in actions the character could take. This works if you're dealing with something like an open world RPG, but if you're interested in tight storytelling with a consistent tone, theme, direction characterization, etc., you need to limit player agency. Characters like Joel or Ellie would be significantly less interesting and memorable if they were just blank slates with no definitive personalities.

&gt;Upsetting the audience is going to sour some subfraction of the audience to your work no matter what.

Any story decision is going to sour some subfraction of the audience no matter what because audiences aren't a monolith and you can't please everyone. Sometimes, upsetting the audience will actually enhance their enjoyment, because upsetting things are interesting, create conflict, develop intrigue, increase emotional engagement, etc.

&gt;it came off as pretentious and desperate to many players - it repeatedly tried to shock the audience, but the message it was trying to shock the audience with wasn't very deep

Once again, you keep talking in platitudes. You simply assert that other people didn't like it for X reasons, but haven't justified why those reasons are valid. I could do the same and just assert that:

""It came off as brilliant and engaging for many players. The message it gave was profound and thought-provoking, providing them with a unique emotional experience unseen of in many games.""

And now we're at an impasse now because no actual arguments have been made, just statements about what other people thought without backing them up.

The only argument that's actually been made so far is about player agency and how that affects the narrative, which we still haven't managed to actually resolve.

You say ""Shocking the audience is easy. Doing so in a meaningful fashion is something else."" But you never defined what counts as meaningful and how it applies TLOU2, you just assert that it doesn't work and then move on.

I said in an earlier comment:

""Ellie’s hatred consumed her, she went on a murder spree in the hopes that it would resolve her feelings of hatred and loss, and it didn’t. All the killings, throwing her friends and loved ones under the bus in pursuit of revenge, severing all her relationships to achieve it, all of it did nothing. It just left her alone and empty inside. That’s one of the major themes. Holding onto hatred does nothing good for you, and will only make you suffer more in the long term if you don’t let it go.""

I never got a response to this, so I'm not sure how you feel about it, but this is an actual argument. I'm not speaking vaguely, I point out how the ending of the game reinforces the message and how the bleak tone is necessary for this to drive the point home. You may agree or disagree, but I didn't just say ""game smart and good, most people think so"" and then not explain anything further.

&gt;If no one consumes your art, or tries to and rejects it, then you aren't really achieving your goal.

So then TLOU2 must be a fantastic work of art, given how many copies have been consumed and how many people played through the story. By your own standard, at least.

&gt;Those who are unskilled and unaware of it believe that art is mostly subjective.

Once again, you speak in vague platitudes. I want arguments. I asked you specifically how you determine something is good or bad without bias and you completely dodged the question. I want an answer.

&gt; Evaluating art is a value judgement

Value judgments are inherently subjective. Whenever you use terms like good, bad, better, worse, etc. is a statement of opinion and not factual. ""Improvement"" is subjective, because it relies on a form of axiomatic bias. Unless you can prove that goodness/badness is some kind of inherent natural law like gravity, any value judgment cannot be objective.

Your defense against this has been that consensus determines objectivity, which is flawed for a number of reasons. One, that isn't what objectivity means. Two, it's an argumentum ad populum fallacy. Three, what if there is no consensus, or the consensus changes over time, or the consensus changes depending on which expert you ask? Your argument only works under the assumption that consensus is uniform and unchanging.

&gt;Across many rounds, the same people ended up on the top and the bottom. That would be impossible if art was mostly subjective.

That anecdote doesn't prove the objectivity of art, it proves that people liked the artwork. This anecdote is poor even if I believed the consensus argument. Because it's a sample size of one competition with one set of judges. If the same artworks had been examined by a completely different set of judges and yielded opposite results, what then? Which judges were correct?

Also, what happens if the audience likes something that the experts didn't or vice-versa? Is the audience objectively wrong for not agreeing with the experts? If so, then your previous arguments about large amounts of people not liking something as justification for it being bad is unusable. Are the experts wrong for not following the consensus of the audience? If so, then using experts as a measurement of objective quality falls apart.

&gt;Some people are simply much better artists than others are. That would be impossible if art was mostly subjective.

But you still haven't explained how you determine what ""better"" is without involving bias and what measurement you're using.

Understanding why is key to understanding how ludonarrative dissonance (among other things) can negatively impact players' perception of a narrative-based game.

&gt; All games still limit the amount of the control and agency the players have in some way, be it game mechanics, story, technological limitations, etc. By this logic, any video game that has limitations on the player is doing a bad job. 

It isn't good vs bad. It's whether or not it weakens the impact of the work for a section of the audience - which it does.

It is this bimodal thinking that causes you to not understand.

You think you can disagree with their emotional response, but it doesn't work that way. They understood the work just fine. It didn't work for them for the reasons I pointed out.

You're looking for reasons why that emotional response is wrong. But that's not how it works.

&gt; I didn’t get a choice to not kill civilians in Spec Ops.

And this is, in fact, something that weakens Spec Ops. Indeed, one of the more common complaints about that game is that because of the way that the game railroads you into some choices, players who tried to do other things to avoid making those choices ended up undermining the experience significantly for themselves, because forcing the player to do something then condemning them for doing it *is* less effective.

It's one of the more common complaints about the game.

Railroading can and does weaken the emotional impact of a lot of things like this in games. If the player tries to avoid doing something, but is railroaded into it by the game, it *does* weaken the emotional impact of that bit.

One of the great tricks that Bioshock pulled on players - and the reason why it worked so well - is precisely because it tricked the player. It wasn't until the game *actually* took away control from the player that the player would WANT to disobey Atlas. They just don't think of it.

This made the twist much more impactful, because the player had voluntarily gone along with it, rather than having to be drug in kicking and screaming as they tried to avoid it but were forced to do something anyway.

&gt; You’re going to have to explain this sentence, particularly what you mean by “requirement.” 

Upsetting the audience is going to sour some subfraction of the audience to your work no matter what. Thus, you don't want to do it unless whatever you are doing requires you to upset the audience to make it work. If you can get the same point across without upsetting the audience, it's generally preferable not to do so, because it has a tendency to alienate some portion of the consumers of your work.

Shocking the audience is easy. Doing so in a meaningful fashion is something else.

Indeed, this was a major reason why The Last of Us 2 ended up coming off as very clumsy to a lot of people - the message of the work was very simplistic, even facile, but the game wanted it to be a deep and meaningful point. This disconnect resulted in the game feeling like it was trying way too hard, which undermined its emotional impact for a chunk of the audience, as it was trying to be shocking but the message it was going for was not only glaringly obvious but not very deep.

As such, it came off as pretentious and desperate to many players - it repeatedly tried to shock the audience, but the message it was trying to shock the audience with wasn't very deep, rendering the ""shocks"" not very meaningful or worthwhile, just a slog.

There's a reason why angsty teenagers are looked down on by adults - because they want to be all deep and mature, but they're not. They try to go for what they percieve as the trappings of maturity, but because they don't actually understand what maturity means, they end up coming off as shallow psuedointellectuals (which they kind of are). And they resent the adults for looking down on them like that, and percieving their immaturity, as they think they're mature - far more so than they actually are.

&gt; Wow, so we’re just letting money be the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes good art?

Art has the primary purpose of communication.

If no one consumes your art, or tries to and rejects it, then you aren't really achieving your goal.

&gt; Responding to this could be a novel in its own right, but I’ll keep it short. If you want a more in-depth refutation, I recommend this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jCuxCv22iI

Those who are unskilled and unaware of it believe that art is mostly subjective.

People who are actually skilled at art are aware that it is mostly objective, which is why they were able to improve at it.

This upsets people who are unskilled, as it undermines their pseudointellectual sophistry, as well as their feelings of self-worth.

That's not to say that you can simply stick a quality-mometer into a work and determine how good it is. Evaluating art is a value judgement, which requires talent in the skill ([which is true of evaluating skill in general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=The%20Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger%20effect%20is,recognize%20their%20lack%20of%20ability.)).

If you take a collection of works, and have a group of artists who are talented in that discipline evaluate those works, you'll find that there is very clear differentiation, and that skilled artists will consistently end up coming out in the top ranks, while unskilled ones will consistently end up coming out in the bottom ranks, across many trials. This is true even if the entries are anonymized.

I know this because I've engaged in and judged dozens of such competitions - anonymous fiction writing, and people judging the anonymously authored works, with the actual writers being revealed at the end.

"ggaf5d0","I'm not the person you were replying to, but as someone who is not very observant (I have ADHD) and who goes out of my way to ask how others feel because I worry I am missing subtle cues, I can offer a different perspective. I apologize in advance for this being pretty long oof, lol. 

0. Before I respond to specific stuff you said. I think it's central to mention that in relationships people have different preferences for how organic communication should be. What should people notice on their own; what do I need to say; how much do I want to explain; how hard is it for me to explain; etc.? Basically, every person has different expectations and preferences when it comes down to how much they want to spell things out or need to have things spelled out. \*And, of course, it is absolutely reasonable to expect your partner to be observant.\*

1. I agree with your take on friends. You have more than one friend--so it's alright if you're less close with some--though you can still have conflict when close friends you have higher expectations for stop matching your level of effort.

That said, the point of communication isn't to reduce your 50% to match their 10%, it's to nudge the other party--assuming they are truly ignorant and unaware of what you want--to accommodate your needs once they have greater certainty about what you want after communicating to them how you feel. If they really didn't know and genuinely care, they'll change their behavior, probably, pretty quickly. 

2. Yes, people lie to get what they want, but actions speak louder than words. When you are getting to know someone and don't know them or their personality yet, it can be hard to figure out how the other person feels and what they want regardless of putting in effort. \*People are really complex and can differ from each other in pretty much almost every way you can imagine -- and a lot of ways you can't imagine because you don't even realize that something you take for granted isn't the case for someone else.\* This is way I am usually direct and take the initiative to ask what people want. Sometimes people prefer if you ask way less and try to figure out purely from observing, and this tends to give me a headache, lol. But everyone has their own needs though it can be really difficult to guess what someone wants. I also take things like reaching out frequently whether by text or call unless I'm very busy for granted -- but not everyone does. So even if it looks like someone doesn't care, that may not be the case. If they roast you for trying to communicate your needs when you bring up wanting to talk more, then they're not for you. And if they lie, whether or not they are serious will be very apparent after some time passes. Like I said before, if people are genuine, they will change their behavior. They may slip up sometimes when particularly stressed or swamped, but the behavior should be fixed the rest of the time if they're genuine (and you were clear and direct about what you wanted). 

You said you were worried that bringing up your concerns would make the other person match you because you wanted it rather than they wanted it. While I understand that perspective, it's inaccurate. It's very easy to go: ""oh she wants this; I want to make her happy, so let me do this thing she asked me to do, because it makes her happy and I like making her happy."" People often start doing something out of a sense of obligation and find value in it afterwards. Relationships are about companionship, communication, compromise, and identity. When one person communicates what they want, the other party needs to strike a balance between compromising and sticking to what they value. People are so complicated that you will be compromising a lot. And you just need to do it in a way that strikes a balance between accommodation and self-identity. It's like with any friendship when you get particularly close--when you aren't close it's easy to just ignore aspects of the other party--but when your boundaries are small, you're going to have to compromise a lot more. It's a personal choice how much or how little you want to have to compromise, but most people are very different from each other and it becomes apparent over time--so looking for someone similar isn't always feasible. A different concern is that some people expect you to guess what they're thinking (for certain things) without having to spell it out. And you may worry that bringing something up will lead them to react negatively. This is when you need to rely on luck. If the other person is a good fit for you, they won't react poorly most of the time when you can't tell what they want or communicate what you need. 

3. When it comes down to effort, I'd say that it is best to want someone who wants to talk as much as you, who wants similar space or lack thereof, etc. If you're treating dating like companies speed-reading through resumes and tossing them aside as soon as they aren't sufficiently perfect on some basic level, then this makes sense. That said, how close people are changes over time--and effort changes too. It should never go down drastically unless the other party is in a crisis--otherwise they're just not interested. But it'll often start lower and increase over time as you become more attached. 

What I'm trying to say is that you're trying to solve the problem of having the other party suited to you by filtering out people who don't naturally put in the same effort from the start. I think it may be more helpful, to reframe this problem as something stemming from what you expect other people to be able to understand about you without saying anything and vice versa. If clear communication could have changed the other person's behavior once they knew you felt comfortable with (or wanted) more attention, then it makes sense to focus on that first, and then if that doesn't work move on. But since compromise is always necessary, why not start early to see how they handle it--if they handle it very well, that's worth more than initially looking compatible. 

TLDR: Communication is always worth a shot from the beginning because you can't be certain who will care or not until you say something. And if someone changes their behavior properly after you voice something, it means it'll be easier for them to compromise with you down the line when you have different values--and that is more valuable than similarity.",1608322679,"that said, the point of communication isn't to reduce your 50% to match their 10%, it's to nudge the other party--assuming they are truly ignorant and unaware of what you want--to accommodate your needs once they have greater certainty about what you want after communicating to them how you feel.","ignorant and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"truly ignorant and unaware","ignorant",NA,"truly",0

1. When he died in Ose tower

2. Shulk did die. He was revived and kept alive by Zanza, but his conscience and thoughts was still present and unaware of Zanza. By the time Shulk died, he was outside the margins of fate and was able to will himself back.

3. One way or another, yes he is a machine of some kind. He takes on the appearance of a human to fit in with homs. 

4. My headcanon is that it's a recreation of Zanza's home universe for Zanza to basically live in.

Basically, Zanza lived in Shulk's body so that he could attempt to destroy the Mechonis again. If you remember Arglas, the giant that Zanza originally possessed, Zanza's plan was to basically use Shulk as another Arglas. Meyneth was defeated quicker than Zanza expected, so he took her Monado and abandoned Shulk's body. 

Shulk and Alvis have a little talk where Shulk realizes that he was and still is outside of the passage of fate because Zanza let him change the passage of fate with his visions. If you recall when Shulk first started having his own visions, not the ones Zanza gave him, that was an indication that Shulk was now outside of the passage of fate.

Shulk and friends travel to Zanza's area, where they see our universe, what is later revealed to be Zanza's home universe that he destroyed. They fight Zanza, and Shulk finally understands the nature of fate and his impact on the future. Alvis also reveals that he is the source of the Monados (they never really say why he let any of them use his power. Maybe it's because he's a computer and does the will of the ""admins""?). Then we see Shulk kill Zanza, and Alvis shows how Zanza destroyed his universe, and Zanza (now also known as Klaus) and Meyneth became the gods of the new universe. Shulk, now being the only being outside of the passage of fate (basically a god), is asked what he wants of the universe. Shulk refuses to decide, and let's everyone make their own decisions, effectively destroying the concept of fate.",1607914669,"he was revived and kept alive by zanza, but his conscience and thoughts was still present and unaware of zanza.","present and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"still present and unaware","present",NA,"still",0

I met my wife when I was younger and we’ve been together ever since. I have a big loving family, and have kids and grandkids who are all doing very well. I live in a nice house, I still keep up with some friends, I basically have everything I could ever want.

""Is that some sort of Courier's saying? never heard of it before sir.""

I looked at him, the wrinkles on his face quite apparent now. I wasn't sure how old he was before due to the energy he showed when serving previous customers, but now...

...I could tell that this man had lived for a long time, probably seen more of the world than me despite being a Courier of the Advancing City.

""It does, going from city to city in a world in ruins gives me a lot of time to think...think 'bout my packages, the people I've met and I'm 'bout to meet; and my future,"" I said not looking at him but the empty glass in my hand.

"gfarek6","To be honest, myself being a parent, don't be nervous, at all. You've made it clear how much they both love you. They're going to be so happy that you came to them about it and that you expressed how it makes you feel. I am 100% sure that one of the first things out of their mouth is going to be ""honey why didn't you come to us sooner?!?!?""  
  
  
As far as trying to get them to sit down with you together without arguing, I would tell each of them separately something along the lines of ""I need to tell you something extremely important that has been eating away at me mentally and emotionally for a very long time. I need (other parent) present when I do speak to you about this because I'd like to discuss it with both of you present. I love you both very very much and I just ask that we can all be calm and civil for my sake so I can discuss something extremely important and urgent with both of my parents there. You are the two most important people to me in this entire world and I hope you can understand that I am asking you to do this for me, not (other parent)"".

If he continues I ignore it instead of arguing back which would make it even more uncomfortable for our children. Even if one of your parents is unwilling (Doubtful), as long as one parent can have self control and remain calm without arguing back with the other parent then things will at least get a little better for you.

Maybe it is my own personal view point that if you do something you stick by it. They are all adults and have been working in the entertainment industry for a while at this point. If they thought it was a smart idea to post the room of truths or even make it in the first place. They also had plenty of chance between recording and it being released for them to think about their actions and simply ask the editor to remove that part of the video.  Then they left it up for a year and change.

All deleting stuff that is known does is say ""yes I know I'm a massive piece of shit but I'm going to hide it so you don't get angry at me"" rather then the actual respectable set up of ""I know I was an ass hole in the past and I realize I was wrong and I'm going to own up to what I was but I am changing myself because that behavior was wrong.""

&amp;#x200B;

The actual secondary issue that this has shown that actually now bothers me more is how quickly some people in the community have reverted so quickly back to  the general stance of ""AH are infallible and you are never allowed to question or challenge anything they do because they are perfect""  that has started to sprout up again.

"geraayn","[First I would suggest that you choose a model by which to answer and approach your questions.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#ProCon) I cannot answer your questions because the question of ""What is consciousness?"" is not answered. For instance if we were to hold a simple understanding of consciousness being merely self-aware of one's own perceived self (self-recognition) rather than a deeper valuation of consciousness (self-shaping) it is likely that we would maintain a much different type of mystified sense where in the first we would likely fall into solipsism whilst in the second we may venture down roads of empiricism with ourselves being the subject of study rather than the world being subjected to our studying.

This begets the second problem because consciousness is, in and of itself, a concept. So to be conscious and unaware of your own consciousness likely cannot exist. My reasoning is that in order to be conscious one must have a concept of consciousness. In the simplest reference above if you cannot recognize your own reflection then you have no sense of your own physical status; you do not and cannot know what you look like. This does not mean that you do not have vision by which to see your own reflection (which I think is closer to the question you asked) but instead that you simply cannot process it. Consciousness, even in the rudimentary sense, does seem to be relative to the ability to process oneself within the world rather than simply the world at large.",1607215390,"so to be conscious and unaware of your own consciousness likely cannot exist.","conscious and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"conscious and unaware","conscious",NA,NA,0

You can have a relationship and/or family but only after getting psychological help from a professional. (no, praying and some organized religious leader does not count)

I do not trust medical or science experts anymore. They have sold out to Big Pharma and science was hijacked by politics for some time. I should've seen the signs with one of my childhood favorites, Bill Nye, sell out with Bill Nye saves the World.

Honestly, I was the other woman at one time. I had no idea he was seeing someone else. He was clearly a practised liar and went to great lengths to keep me and her separated and unaware of each other. When it all came out, I got most of the blame for being the other woman. It hurt a lot because I was already heartbroken at the end of the relationship, had been blindsided and lied to, etc and then I suddenly had a label as a home wrecker too. Those were dark days and I can't say I'm 100% over that entire situation a decade later.

Edit: also if you're friends with someone in a situation like this, speak up. It was upsetting to know mutual friends knew I was unaware of being the other woman and they said nothing to me.

"gdqnzp0","Our cat is totally indoor. He has a cat tree upstairs and downstairs and lots of toys. Even something simple like the lid off a soft drink bottle that will roll on its side, he loves to play with, but be ready to fish it out from under the fridge and furniture.  He has two litter trays in one of the bedrooms at opposite ends of the room. One he uses to wee in, the other strictly poops.  We found keeping these trays really clean helps heaps. So remove any wet litter or poop as soon as practical and replace it with fresh clean litter. The litter trays were bought at the Reject Shop for $2.50 each so they are nothing whizz bang but easy to clean and sturdy made out of plastic.  Also we made him a little cat cave separate from his cat trees where he can go in and hide but still look out at everything. We did find that the one time he got out he'd lost a bit of his outdoor awareness. He just seemed a bit disorientated and unaware of what was going on, like cars and dogs. He doesn't go out at all anymore. Also lots of hugs, positive reinforcement and talk to him and include him in things. Often people do this more with a dog than a cat.  If he has a toileting accident, don't berate him. If it's poop put it in the tray and cover it up or if it's wee clean it up quietly and gently put him in the litter tray.  Cats are clean, if something goes wrong it can be due to a change in their routine or sometimes it's just an off day.  In the end, litter training is patience and persistence and always with lots of praise. The things I suggested worked for us and I think our dear boy is happy and we do not have a big place, it's just split levels. When we started litter training we would put him in his tray occasionally, at different times but someone else may have a better suggestion and there should be lots of stuff online but ignore anything that remotely suggests any discipline. It won't work as they associate bad things with their litter tray. As I said this worked for us but other people will have other ideas too.

"gdoilf5","This will get lost in all the comments, but I actually went to game stop like a month ago in person for the first time in maybe a decade. And I will say I have the best customer service experience of my life. 

It was a middle aged woman running the store by herself. I was trading in my ps4 to put towards my ps5 preorder through game stop. She let me know what because I bought it online and didn’t preorder at her store, she would have to call the corporate line and have them apply the amount remotely. While she is on the phone with them, she was helping several other customers too. When she finally got through to the department she needed to speak with, she step by step explained to them the whole process but the person on the phone seemed very confused and unaware of how to do the request to apply my trade in. She kept making sure that in no way was my preorder to be canceled, and that all that needed to be done was apply a gift card to the order. 

She quickly realized this person was about to cancel my preorder and told them to stop everything. She apologized to me and said she was scared they would mess it up and didn’t want me to lose out on my ps5. She said that I should come back in person when I have my ps5 and she would do it herself. 

She went above and beyond to help me when she didn’t need to. She was genuinely concerned it would mess up my preorder. And during all this time of being on hold, her and I was just casually talking. She told me how she loves video games because it gives her a chance to connect with her son. And how her and her son spend the evenings together playing. 

I left the store totally happy. Even though I didn’t get what I came in for originally, this woman’s attitude and dedication to the customers was amazing.

I would have ACTUALLY been there for you, and NEVER complained about pregnancy symptoms, or brought it up AT ALL. It's not hard to be a decent human being. DEFINIETLY wouldn't have ever dismissed a miscarriage, which is exactly what she did. And I've never experienced a miscarriage, but that doesn't mean I can't be empathetic that it's extremely hard. 

I've been on both sides, and honestly I find these things show you people's true character. Don't feel guilty for not being there for her, she showed that she wasn't there for you. Relationships require work from both sides, and yeah sometimes one needs more than the other, and sometimes one can't give anything, but the fact she didn't even ask you about you, or had enough sensitivity to NOT talk about her pregnancy, which is not a huge fucking ask. 

I bet if you look back through your friendship, this is not the first time that she's been incredibly selfish. It's just not as obvious before. She was always like this, maybe a bit worse when she was pregnant, but I bet you were always the one putting effort in this relationship. 

I ended a friendship when we were struggling to conceive. She was always a bit annoying, but was a good work friend. Well she had her baby when we were hitting that stage of trying when I was really struggling, and all she could talk about was her baby. And some of that is normal, but literally she was not able to talk about ANYTHING else. And she had talked to me DAILY about their fertility struggles, so I thought she'd understand how stressful it can be (and at that point we had been trying longer than they had taken.) I would try to change the subject from her baby to other people at work, or ANYTHING ELSE, and she'd bring it right back to her baby. The last lunch with her, I eventually just stopped talking, and she didn't seem to notice, too busy talking about her baby. She tried to book lunch with me a month or two later, which I refused. At the time I thought it was to apologize, but I wasn't ready to see her, I was still too angry at her complete lack of empathy. A month later she announced her second pregnancy, and I realized that she had no idea she had upset me, and she wanted to tell me all about her pregnancy. She always had been this selfish, and unaware of everything around her, it just became way more obvious, and worse, when she got pregnant. No regrets ending that friendship!

I wish for everyone that we were coming together under happier circumstances, and maybe some day when real change when it comes to diagnostic tests like this are made that will in fact be the case, but it sounds like for now they're still performing this godawful procedure.

A few things: 

does anyone know if there are any alternatives available 
 to this for parents whom are being told their child needs this procedure? Because if there are maybe if someone would post what those alternatives are so that they can bring them up to their children's doctor that would be a start to having less traumatized kids/adults walking this earth.

"gd6d7bk","Agreed. My best friend is a single mom and I’ve been close with her since her son was 2, years before I met my BF. We’ve been so close due to estrangement with my family, that all holidays I spent for years were with her family. I had birthday cakes with her and her son and then her daughter when she was born. Around that time their Dad left and has been completely out of the picture. We’re so close I call her kids my niece and nephew. On and off I’ve gone from babysitting everyday, to just weekends throughout the years. When I met my BF, I was clear how important the kids were to me and my being there for them. He accepted it. We’ve been together 5 years, and like I said at times I’d have to watch them 3-4 days in a row, or an entire weekend. Sometimes he’d grumble how I’m babysitting again! But he knew that she needed me. He also has done things with me and the kids those days and he learned quickly how freaking stressful and exhausting 2 kids are even just for a few hours. 

He’s always known my GF is an excellent mom and she just needs me because she has to work, or when her parents need a break and he’s learned to enjoy his time alone, or he’s learned to enjoy the time with them when they come here. The kids love him and he loves them. 

If he ever behaved the way OP’s husband did, I’d be gone. Being in a child’s life is a big responsibility and when they are family or like family, it’s important. For me, it isn’t just about helping my friend, it’s also about doing what makes me happy. I love those kids and being with them and spending time with them, especially since they grow so freaking quick (they are now 13 and 7) is something that means a lot to me. It is what I CHOOSE to do and what I WANT to do, even if on that particular day I don’t feel like it, or I have a lot going on. It’s still important to me that I’m there for them and for a friend who made me apart of her family when I had no one for a time. 

Going by how many times OP helps, her husbands annoyance is ridiculous. To me it sounds like he just doesn’t want to share her with anyone. He doesn’t want kids in their house. But, that’s her family, and his too. Family helps family. If he can’t handle kids, which some people can’t and I get that especially younger ones, then he could always make plans for himself on those days or talk to his wife about watching them at her sisters house so he could have quiet time at home. At least that’s something. 

But it seems like he just doesn’t want his wife helping these kids at all. He seems to think that it’s being a bad mother having to work and support your children, and he doesn’t seem to realize how much actual childcare costs or why it makes sense for anybody to use a relative who’s eager to watch them and not nearly as expensive as childcare. He seems horribly immature and unaware of what’s even going on here. When I was younger my aunt was a single mom and my mom was in the early stages of MS and stayed at home for me and my sister. She would watch my Aunt’s kids (Dad’s sister) and us which has her babysitting 5 days a week for 4 kids under 7. She did that because that’s what you do for family. Obviously, it was an even bigger benefit because as cousins we all got to grow up together and it was so much fun for us. My point being that family doesn’t force kids or make you feel obligated to watch them, but when it works out for those involved, you help out. That’s all. 

So he doesn’t have to be OK with his sister in law taking advantage of his wife because she’s not. His wife wants to help her sister, her sister needs help, and there’s nothing wrong with any of this. The fact he called CPS, an agency to provide help for abused or neglected kids, and admitted it was in the hopes of sending a wake up call to sister in law not to use them for babysitting, is disgusting. He’s a terribly immature and oblivious man. He seems to be totally disregarding his wife and her family and thinking only of himself. I hope she gets into counseling with him where they can discuss this because what he did isn’t normal and I don’t want to automatically assume he’s like this when it comes to all aspects of their marriage. But she should find out if she’s blind to the fact that he is.",1606027375,"he seems horribly immature and unaware of what’s even going on here.","immature and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"horribly immature and unaware","immature",NA,"horribly",0

"gd3xttm","Yes, these are kind of continuous with each other, they used to be part of the same construct, and psychoanalysts, e.g. Salman Akhtar, still see these two constructs in this way.

If you're interested in learning more about schizoid PD (and avoidant PD) I would suggest looking at the r/schizoid subreddit. The sub's wiki google doc has a couple of full text pieces in there that are quite good. They both go into detail explaining what I just said about the relationship between SzPD and AvPD, and a lot more than that.

One of these two pieces, which is a PhD thesis on analytic treatment of schizoid personality by Zachary Wheeler, you can find for free here, there's no paywall: https://search.proquest.com/openview/10cb591b9eb8147e5881ffc5bb279e66/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y

And, a shorter chapter that isn't on that google doc, but I feel is really good at explaining what it is like to be schizoid, for most people who are schizoid: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Psychoanalytic_Diagnosis_-_Nancy_McWilli.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjlvaOm87qAhUUbs0KHfWkA3MQFjANegQICBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vrBsRB7R6pwJpqie16g4-

I say most people who are schizoid because it's quite rare for people with a schizoid personality to be as withdrawn and reclusive, and unaware of their relational needs as the DSM diagnostic criteria make them seem to be.

It's chapter 9 in that pdf, for the stuff about schizoid personality. The intro sections of the book are also great as an introduction to the modern, ego psychology/object relations, integrative approach that has been gaining some traction in psychoanalytic circles in recent years.

This is the approach taken by one of the leading experts on personality disorder, Otto Kernberg, and is what informs the manualized PD treatment, Transference Focused Psychotherapy, that he and his colleagues at Cornell have conceived of based on about 4 decades of research. The Wheeler thesis is attempting to describe how to apply this approach to schizoid PD, so this is still being worked on (it was published in 2013).. as is the case elsewhere in psychotherapy research, schizoid and avoidant pathology is kind of neglected while BPD and NPD have gotten most of the research attention so far (probably because people who have these disorders come in for treatment more, and because their behaviour is more outwardly destructive. And in the case of borderline PD'd people they're more willing to admit they have problems and take steps to actually seek treatment).

Also, about the other piece in the sub's wiki google doc, the book the Ralph Klein chapters in that doc are from, you can find on libgen. The title is Disorders of the Self, edited by James Masterson and Ralph Klein. It's a collection of papers but the first 150 or so pages are all on SzPD and all written by Ralph Klein.

"gd3ooou","Oh totally no one has ever quit their job to go travel and take a break from the work life. National parks are still open in the US to some extent and still plenty to do.

The market is pretty decent still for public accounting jobs, especially for experienced associates and up, so I don't see the risk. 

Now let's discuss your political comment:

I mean the pandemic in itself is very much a political discussion as we are in this situation because of mismanagement at the political level and the lack of care through a decent chunk the US.

You can still travel within the US if you so want to. Is it the same? No, but I know a handful of people traveling and taking vacation still within the US. Plus not everything is closed.

So the person I originally responded left such a open ended suggesting that traveling in the middle of a pandemic is some how wrong ,bad, or dumb?? when the populace has shown collectively that that they don't care, political leaders from both side can't actually lead and make the hard decisions, so the overall lack of awareness to cast some shade onto a suggestion when society in itself collectively has failed in the US at handling this. If I quit my job tomorrow and If I want to go travel, I am going go do it. Why should I care about society if society in itself has completely gone against what is suggested not to do!

I understand people need to feel righteous and the need to feel they are the better individual every chance they get but the lack of awareness of the general climate of covid 19 is hilarious and hypocritical across the entire nation.

Oh covid 19 cases are spiking, oh no shit because it was just halloween, election season, tons of mass gathering's from both the left and right and people still have the audacity to cast shade and use the pandemic as some kind of wrench of righteousness because I suggested traveling?

Are you people so lost and unaware of anything that is going on or do you just put on the blinders of all the miss actions and lack of action to stuff that is actually driving cases? Or do you just need to find every chance to make someone look bad even without the glaring hypocrisy of society?

Jesus emphasizes a teaching 3 times in Matthew 7

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Narrow and Wide Gates  
&gt;  
&gt;*13 “Enter  through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that  leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. 14 For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are* ***few who find it****.*

&gt;A Tree and Its Fruit  
&gt;  
&gt;*15 “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will \[*[*bx*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23333bx)*\]know them by their fruits. \[*[*by*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23333by)*\]Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? 17 So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, you will \[*[*bz*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23337bz)*\]know them by their fruits.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*21 “Not  everyone who says to Me, ‘****Lord, Lord****,’ will enter the kingdom of  heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. 22* ***Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord,*** *did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many \[*[*ca*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-23339ca)*\]miracles?’ 23 And then I will declare to them,* ***‘I never knew you; leave Me, you who practice lawlessness.’***

Luke gives more information where Jesus clarified even further:

&gt; *22 And He was passing through one city and village after another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. 23 And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?” And He said to them, 24 “Strive to enter through the narrow door; for* ***many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able****. 25 Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open up to us!’ and He then will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’ 26 Then you will begin saying, ‘We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!’ 27 And yet He will \[*[*k*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-25539k)*\]say, ‘I do not know where you are from; leave Me, all you \[*[*l*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13&amp;version=NASB#fen-NASB-25539l)*\]evildoers.’*  

Jesus is teaching that a MINORITY of those who CLAIM TO BE CHRISTIAN go to heaven.

And it is because they are actually workers of iniquity. They are so twisted that they have actually fooled themselves into thinking they're right with God. But God knows the heart and he knows better. These people who are affirming this are false converts, false teachers, false prophets and false churches. They need to be evangelized -- or avoided, depending on context, but we have no fellowship with them because they hate God and they therefore hate us and seek our harm.

I had a similar experience. I played FF7 first as a child and didn't appreciate many of the nuances of Cloud's character. But in my teenage years, and especially my young adulthood, were heavily shaped by major depression and generalized anxiety, to the point that it profoundly impacted my life and my ability to function. It was when replaying the game multiple times over these years that I fully grew to understand and appreciate Cloud's struggles with himself, his identity, who he believed he was, and who he actually wanted be.

I also find Cloud truly inspiring -- to have a hero begin the game so truly broken and unaware of the extent of his brokenness, only to have him grow and confront himself, reject the falsehoods that have clouded *(pun intended)* his vision, accept his mistakes and his losses and his failures for what they are, and become a better, stronger, healthier, truer version of himself brings me to the verge of tears just thinking about it.

If Cloud could do it, I could do it. And it was hard -- therapy, medication, more therapy, a major change of life circumstances, a lot of self-reflection, and a lot of help from my friends later, and I am better and stronger and happier and more at peace than I ever was before. And it's not like my problems are magically gone. It's still hard sometimes. I think it always will be. But I know that I can do it. And I know you can too.

So when life seems tough, when the world seems hopeless and bleak, I remind myself that even Cloud and his friends weren't sure they wanted to venture into that final cavern -- but they did anyway. So can we.

Life can't contain us.

"gckj7kr","I agree the wording is ambiguous - it doesn't explicitly state that they try to take over a PC, but many people have read it that way. I disagree with that interpretation because it doesn't make sense thematically: intellect devourers come from the illithid, who are masters of subterfuge. They aren't going to try and engage adventurers so brazenly in their true form. With only 12 AC and 21 hp, one good round of attacks and they're reduced to pulp, which is exactly what happened in my games - my party had an immediate revulsion to the intellect devourers and their first impulse was to make them go splat.

I think an intellect devourer involuntarily dislodged from its host is more likely to flee and hide. It can use its Detect Sentience trait to avoid creatures that might pose a threat to it. If it wants to assume control of another body, it's likely to wait until the creature is vulnerable - for instance, when it is asleep and unaware of its presence. They may not even opt for a PC - they may simply assume control of another goblinoid on the level. Since these particular intellect devourers are in league with Xanathar's Guild, they might even do none of the above and just hide and await instructions from their illithid handlers.

I personally did not proactively try to replace any PCs with an intellect devourer. I didn't want to tip my hand too early and make them paranoid because I had larger plans for them. Some of their friends and acquaintances have slowly been taken over by intellect devourers, and I am working towards a big reveal that we are incredibly close to. One of them may get replaced before then, but I'm trying to be very subtle about it. It won't be a direct confrontation - again, masters of subterfuge and manipulation, the point is to strike when they're most vulnerable, and least suspecting.",1605580468,"if it wants to assume control of another body, it's likely to wait until the creature is vulnerable - for instance, when it is asleep and unaware of its presence.","asleep and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"asleep and unaware","asleep",NA,NA,0

"gceio7z","No, she wasn't a bad person, but that doesn't mean she's a good person either, and nor does it mean that she's 'out of touch with reality' or has 'lost it'. Sometimes people aren't inherently good or bad, and just make poor decisions.

For example, her main reason for marrying Rose off is because of her father's debts. She wants them to keep their extravagant life together, and the only way that can happen is if Rose marries Cal. She thinks she's doing what's best for Rose and herself. She wasn't so much ignoring how Rose felt as entirely dense and unaware of how unhappy she was. That's not being out of touch with reality, some people are just bad at reading other people's emotions, especially since Rose didn't seem very keen on revealing those emotions to Cal or her Mother. Rose is her child, and she is going off with this steerage boy, and putting her relationship at Cal at risk, and Ruth thinks the marriage with Cal is what's best for her and Rose. Ergo, Rose doesn't know what's best for herself and Ruth has to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.

This almost entirely explains her actions in the movie. Ruth and Rose have serious communication problems and Ruth thinks she's doing what's best for her and her child (because Rose doesn't know). This is why she behaves so rudely to Jack (another reason for which is the class divide and how inappropriate it would have been to socialize with someone of the working class) and is so unaware of Rose's unhappiness and pushes back on Rose not wanting to marry Cal and her seeing Jack.

As far as the part with the lifeboats goes, that's entirely different. Few of the first class were taking the sinking seriously when the earlier boats were being loaded, the same way she wasn't. She's a first class lady and she cares about class and comfort, and doesn't seem to be aware that half the people are going to die (until Rose tells her) Discriminating against people of lower classes was wrong then and it is wrong now, but because of the time and circumstances in which she was brought up, we can't expect her to know any better, or for such ingrained values to immediately change. Such discrimination was perfectly acceptable back then.

TLDR; Ruth is a flawed human being, and a mistaken mother who believes she is entirely justified in her actions.

"gcdyoxl","Ahhh you edited it. I was wondering what all the fuss was about. 

Well as someone with a high affinity for the agency perception—I don’t especially see liberals as being free of attribution bias.

I believe it’s multi-directional on a line between agency and environment.

Where one can be too biased toward agency, another can be too biased toward environment. 

Realistically you’re also pointing out the general population’s inability to recognize nuances. 

In fact, I can say with absolute certainty that an environmental attribution bias exists. 

The belief that one has little agency has a tendency to lead a person into depression or other forms of mental illness.

Just as having too high a perception of agency may lead that person to develop narcissistic tendencies or other indirect expressions of mental illness. 

If good mental health is defined as balance—and it is—then we can also see there’s an ever increasingly larger problem between both political parties to maintain moderation in all things.

"gc7wj51","Would you want to go to school in another country perhaps? You might be able to get a student visa. You can also get work visas without necessarily needing a degree, if you know a trade like construction that could get your foot in the door. There are also countries that actually need citizens and will pay people to move to their towns, and you can work a basic job and work towards citizenship. Still not easy, but absolutely worth looking in to. 

Either way, you’re very hard on yourself, and I’m not gonna tell you not to be because that’s like telling a depressed person to be happy, but I was and still am very hard on myself and thought of myself as a toxic piece of shit for most of my life. Only in the past few years have I really begun to see clearly and become the “real” me, someone I actually like rather than hate. All I’m saying is, you were not born to be a wage slave, nobody was born to be anything, some people are just dealt much shittier hands than others. Our brains have a cruel habit of making us hate ourselves and think we deserve shit lives, but if you’re someone who is kind to people and are able to ask existential questions like this, you do not deserve shitty-ness, you’ve just become so used to thinking you’re worthless, it’s an incredibly hard mindset to break free from. 

If I may, I reaaallly recommend meditation. I used to never take it seriously, I thought it was just sitting down and thinking about things, but once I committed myself to it, it’s pretty life changing. I tried and failed to commit to it several times, failing is okay, but keep trying, you have nothing to lose. Eventually it will become a habit. Just sit or lie down, close your eyes, focus on the blackness of your eyelids, imagine it’s a void like you’re looking into space, and just breathe, slowly and fully, and concentrate on the feeling of breathing in and out. Whatever thoughts come to mind, don’t try to fight them, think about them for a sec, then focus on the black space between your eyes again. It can be incredibly powerful, people are literally able to control their immune systems and hormone levels with mediation, and the science is all there for skeptics. 

It’s easy to worry about the future, I’m always thinking about my loved ones dying and am saddened by the meaninglessness of the universe, but mediation is just about being in the present, try not to worry about what’s going to happen or what will be, just focus on your senses, what do you feel? What do you hear? It can be relaxing as well as illuminating. Our reality can be cruel and brutal, but there’s so much beauty as well.

You say she is not self aware and unaware of attachment theory. If you bring it up she may feel you are saying there is something wrong with her and no one wants to hear that. 

You can love someone as much as you can but love is not enough it can not solve everything. This woman will make you understand your own attachment issues, your needs, triggers etc so you can hopefully learn and grow. As if you were secure you wouldn’t have lasted two years in this situation. It sounds harsh but if you read all the stories on here they never end up working out. Perhaps far down the line in the future when you have both changed if you are single but not now. It takes a long time to unlearn and process changes to become secure. She will need to want to work on herself when something finally clicks and the fear is less than the love for someone which will make something click. You don’t become secure over night or by watching a few videos on you tube. 

I of course am not trying to be harsh I have an FA ex. I was never AP before until we met and ended up in the anxious/avoidance trap at the end when trying to maintain a friendship afterwards but still really wanting her to open up and change when she was unable to be vulnerable and even went into denial in the end.

So both my parents are in nursing school, mu dad graduates in December. We've been poor all our lives collectively, and my parents are getting ready to buy a new home within the next 1-2 years as their income picks up. At our current house, I get no privacy, my mom calls on me to clean dishes while I'm in the shower, she barges into my room all the time, she wakes me up just to tell me we need to clean, and my dad supports all of it. They've had a habit of clingy and overbearing behavior while I was a teenager (I'm now 18).

My mom says she'll hire maids so at the least I won't have to clean for everyone, but she wants me to stay in the house while I go to college (a local uni in town). They'll be paying my tuition and financially supporting me, but according to my mom, being in an apartment will be ""impossible"" and she got angry at me when I said I wanted to live on my own (to get some privacy, though I can't tell her that, she'd get mad). My parents want what's best for me deep down, they have good intent, but it feels like they stifle me by expecting me to be someone I'm not. 

I'd be moving in with my girlfriend I met online who lives in a nearby state and plans on moving here, but there's a small twinge of guilt wanting to move in with someone so important to me I've never told them about.

I haven't told my parents about my girlfriend because she's transgender, and they think I'm a woman (I'm AFAB, nonbinary) and they're transphobic, even if they don't admit they are. They support trans people they don't know but the moment that anyone in the family is trans they can't understand. Not only that, but they're both older and unaware of how the internet is, and generally are afraid of everyone on the internet, acting all ""stranger danger."" They found out I send dirty messages to a 14 year old boy (I was 14 at the time as well) and they convinced themselves I was actually somehow exploited by a 40 year old whose face looks 14, not an actual guy. (He was, indeed, just a 14 year old guy). So, I hope it'd understandable why I don't want to share my internet life, especially that I met a queer woman on the internet they wouldn't respect as a woman and that, in a way, I'm leaving their home for her.

My girlfriend suggested she moved here, and I live with my parents, and we make a cover story that we met and started dating so I can stay over, but even with this sollution, I still feel wrong. My parents want to financially support me, but they don't know me personally because they've hurt me too many times and been too paranoid.

TL;DR: My parents want me to stay with them in their nice new home in a year when I go to college. I want to stay with my girlfriend they don't know about when she moves here, because they don't respect my privacy, but keeping a secret from them and then moving out when they pay for my college makes me feel bad. I can't tell them about her because they wouldn't understand from past experiences I've had. AITA?

"gc0co60","I wonder if people are forgetting this, but in the databook, it's stated Dabi's and Twice's relationship to be that of brotherhood, which implies Dabi's soft spot for Twice.
 
Now this isn't something apparent in the manga since Dabi has little interaction with the league, but I can't dismiss and say he didn't care about Twice's death at all. I think that Hawks betrayal to Twice really did resonate with him in some way. He says it himself that it's ""not his fault"" for causing the mansion to get sieged and remarks how scummy heroes are. He even says how ""messed up"" Hawks' standards are and denies Twice's life as ""unlucky"" because Twice had obviously enjoyed his time in the league since they openly accepted him. I do not think Dabi is this incompetent and unaware of what goes in the League. 

In a way, you could argue that him utilizing Hawks actions was to spur revenge on him for he did to Twice, since before Twice died, he said for Hawks to ""die"" and here, Hawks has metaphorically died since his quirk may have been lost, and his reputation is now also crumbling away slowly.

"gbxs5u4","If you can't admit that your country has serious problems with electoral fraud simply because it might help the opposing party's narrative, then you are being a bad leftie.

I'd rather Americans realize that their elections are heavily tampered with than live in fantasy land.    What's the goal of not informing Americans about electoral fraud in their own country?  To make them more ignorant and unaware of the political machinery in their own country than they currently are?

Regardless, ultimately, the military is the one who decides who sits on the throne of the Oval Office.    A good example of this happened in your very own country back in 2000 under G.W. Bush.  [The military literally created fake ballots to beat out Al Gore at G.W. Bush's request.](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/02/politics/bush-gore-military-ballots/index.html) 

However, unlike G.W. Bush, Trump doesn't have the same level of support with the military.   Not to mention this ignoring the fact that Biden.  And this is among both the [rank and file](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/08/31/as-trumps-popularity-slips-in-latest-military-times-poll-more-troops-say-theyll-vote-for-biden/) and the [generals](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/10/20/list-of-former-senior-military-leaders-backing-biden-now-outnumbers-trumps.html).  At most, he's got tepid support from the military and you need more than that to get help with a coup.

The reason why I think Trump isn't that bad (compared to Biden of course)?

[Because Trump's interventions usually end like this.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-press-trump-for-answers-on-foiled-venezuela-raid)  The Dems were even whining that Trump was too incompetent to successfully regime change Venezuela.

"gbuuneh","Trans people are valid, but it's really not that simple. There are a lot of problems with trying to find gender in neuroscience.

Methodologically these studies can only ever be as good as the gender reported by their participants. But if there's some neural objectivity to gender, then presumably a lot of people out there are ""actually"" trans or non-binary and unaware of it, or not out. This means that the data is full of imperfection since their cis population could contain ""hidden"" trans people. This gets even more complex if you start thinking of how non-binary people would show up in the data.

For every study that showed something being similar among trans and cis people of the same gender, there's another that showed the opposite. [E.g. this study which checked the size of various brain proportions and sizes and found transwomen to be closer to cis men than to cis women](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/21/11/2525/275208) This kind of reverse results should not be read as a refutation of trans identity, but then I think it follows that the results that do find similarity between trans and cis people of the same gender are tapping into something meaningful either. 

Third, for studies that did find a similarity between cis and trans people of the same gender, it's always in some arcane property of the brain that we cannot map to any function. for instance [Luders et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867125/) found that trans woman are more similar to cis women that to cis men in the amount of grey matter in the putamen. Are we now supposed to think that the amount of grey matter in the putamen *is* gender? The putamen is mostly associated with highly-learned motor functions, why would gender ""be"" there. If anything the easier interpretation is that Luders et al. didn't find gender, but various aspects of gender norms and presentation as it pertains to movement, since this is a motor skill area. [Rametti et al. (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395610001585#sec2.1) used Fractional Anisotropy to detect that the directionality of the organization of white matter microstructure in trans women is more similar to that of cis women than to that of cis men. But like wtf is the directionality of white matter microstructure for? No one has a clue, and the idea that that's what gender *is* is meaningless.

These studies rarely actually find identity between trans and cis people; more commonly it's sort of in-between. For instance [Nota et al. (2017)](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453017305590) measured functional connectivity of the resting-state networks and the similarity they find is not that great. If you look at figure 3 of the paper you'll see that different measures go either way in likening trans people to either their actual gender or their AGAB. 

Relatedly, all of these studies cannot detect cause and effect. Brain differences also arise out of learning and doing. We can't jump from brain differences to innate gender, because a lot of the differences could be learned. The grey matter in the putamen from Luders et al. may be better explained by behaviors adopted by trans women that resemble behaviors of cis women, i.e. gender presentation and not gender.

A model of innately gendered brain is also culturally naive. We have clear evidence that gender has a huge cultural component that just cannot be about raw biology. Think of all the cultures with a 'third gender': two-spirits, fa'afafine, hijras, or the Bugis people which have five social genders. Those are all different and show that the gender ""repertoire"" of a community is cultural. Gender is also not a pure emanation of the self; there's some back-and-forth with society. Leslie Feinberg spends a good chunk of Stone Butch Blues telling about how when they were a kid they kept being asked ""are you a boy or a girl?"". That experience, that crucial way of having a body that didn't fit in the cultural codes of femininity or masculinity was obvious crucial to their growing up to be non-binary. Or think of all the aspects of dysphoria that are purely cultural: some people have dysphoria for hair length, clothing, or make-up. There's no way those very culturally arbitrary facts of gender presentation have themselves a biological basis, so clearly dysphoria, however biologically-influenced, is not independent of nurture. This entails that it's not reducible to biology, though of course it interacts with it.

I say: let's stop trying to medicalize gender. It's way more complicated than having a blue or pink brain.",1605035395,"but if there's some neural objectivity to gender, then presumably a lot of people out there are ""actually"" trans or non-binary and unaware of it, or not out.","binary and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"binary and unaware","binary",NA,NA,0

Hi OP! Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! I was a bride in June this year, and I want you to know that it is in no way selfish to express your wants and needs for YOUR wedding to your future wife. While I did most of the planning, every decision for the day was communicated to and okay’d by my husband. It’s your collective day as a couple, and one that should be remembered and cherished as a celebration for just the two of you. 

It seems notable that future BIL hasn’t made his feelings about the rejection clear, and at 22 he’s likely too young, inexperienced, and unaware of how that move would look to others. Maybe you and your fiancé can have a conversation with him collectively to help him understand your position as a couple. Surely future BIL can surely find another time in the next few months to pop the question with family present- the holidays are coming up after all. 

This is your first hurdle as a couple in showing complete solidarity for one another. I do think it is time for your fiancé to get involved in de-escalating the scenario with HER family. She needs to communicate that this is a joint decision that she fully supports. You should not be fielding those calls- if it were me and mine I would be picking up his cell to handle it and telling my family exactly where to shove it. 

Whatever happens, just know that weddings are stressful for everyone, and the most important part is being married at the end of the day. Good  luck to you and your future wife! I wish you both a lifetime of love and happiness.

Not sure how your conclusion here is I'm telling you what you should and shouldn't like. I'm simply saying the insufferable self-righteousness and unflappable belief in being right about anything and everything from a significant number of people of a left-leaning persuasion is a major turnoff for a lot of people, and it's resulting in outcomes you don't like. See your other statements below, for example.

&gt; This was more of a referendum of fascism than a normal election, pretending anything about this was ""just another election like happens every 4 years"" is so dumb I don't know why we're even talking anymore.

If you honestly believe that, then yeah, you and I live in completely different realms of existence. Try staying off twitter for a couple weeks, you might find your way back to reality eventually.

&gt; The basis for leveling your accusations of hypocrisy lies on 1) this being a normal election, which is false 2) people on Saturday taking no precautions, which is false and 3) once-in-a-generation celebrations are no different than going to a movie theater on a tuesday night, which is false

Again, you think this was an abnormal election for some reason. Maybe you're just really young and unaware of anything that happened before 10 years ago, but every election for the last 30+ years has been billed as ""the most important election in history"". Someone gets elected, someone loses, and the country moves on. This is no different, and it's certainly not a ""once-in-a-generation celebration"". The fact you think it's ok to attend a big party, even if you're distancing (lol, totally distanced in a crowd of 500 people) and wearing a mask, neither of those things are 100% effective. Again, you're willing to ignore everything you reeeeeee'd and screeched about from people who disagree with you because it's for a cause you like. It's nothing but hypocrisy.

&gt;We probably don't need to keep this going if you're not going to walk back any of the foolish shit you've said thus far

"gbj8dos","Smoking.... Alcohol... Weed... Prostitutes... literally all of these things are bad. Let's start with smoking. 

Smoking is one of the worst things you can do. First of all, it's actually very addictive. The way cigarettes are designed is that they make your brain want more of it. So you saying you won't smoke anymore after 21 is going to be very hard if you have smoked during it. What makes it worse is that smoking will destroy your lungs, and it might even give you cancer. 

Alcohol is also similiar to smoking. It is very addictive, but it is actually harmful. When you drink alcohol, you might become drunk. While being drunk, you're quite unconscious and unaware of what's going on. Because of that, you might do other horrible things, like killing or rapping someone who's innocent, because you're completely unaware of what happens. Especially when you drive a car while drunk, the chances of you crashing are actually very high because you're so unaware of what's going on. This results in a lot of problems, you might even kill someone who was innocent and it might not be labelled as an accident - don't quote me on that as I am not a lawyer - or you yourself might even crash and die while driving drunk. All of these actions that could happen while being drunk are just horrible and are equally bad. They cause a lot of problems and destroy society even more. Not only all of this could happen from drinking alcohol, there also a lot of other diseases from alcohol. Alcohol is also one of the main reasons people get cancer. 

As for weed, I don't know much about it, but I know that it is very addictive. People say that it feels good, but actually, that comes at a heavy price of their health. Weed can definitely be harmful to your body. 

And lastly, prostitutes. Alright, so a prostitute is someone who will sell you sex, right? Let me ask you a question. How does it feel to have sex with someone who doesn't even now what kind of music you like, who are you even, and this one you're having sex with just wants your money? Horrible right? Absolutely. Not only does it damage your mental health, there are also a lot of other dangers such as STDs, HIVs, the prostitute might accidentally get pregnant - now you might say ""well abortion and what not"" but not all humans are as kind as that. There are some scummy scums in this planet who will take advantage of you. One of them are prostitutes who got pregnant while you were having sex with them - and even tho you were wearing a condom it is not a 100% chance to avoid pregnancy, it's actually like 95% - who will falsely frame you for rape and use that child as evidence. And now your whole reputation is destroyed, and everyone calls you a rapist even though you're not, and it's gonna be very hard to disprove it. You might be asking ""what's even the benefit of doing all that?"" Some people just want to see other people suffer for no reason. It's just their hobby. 

I hope you know why all of these four things are just horrible.",1604800498,"while being drunk, you're quite unconscious and unaware of what's going on.","unconscious and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"quite unconscious and unaware","unconscious",NA,"quite",0

"gb29lp9","Had anorexic subtype b/p. It required restriction with the goal of weight loss to be my main criteria. 

Binges were not necessarily about calories consumed but about the obsessive compulsive uncontrollable need to eat often leading to that dissociative ‘black out’ state. As my stomach had shrunk and I was unused to eating much my binges were often actually quite low calorie compared to those in BED. It was about behaviour not volume or calorie amounts and in anorexia with b/p subtype about eating otherwise ‘unsafe’ or ‘fear foods’ I restricted.

The purging was based in disgust and also the obsessive need to lose weight and punish myself as a form of self harm. I did not vomit but laxative use and not taking meds for a bowel condition that gave me severe diarrhoea were my method as it made me too unwell to eat and force me to restrict. I also walked obsessively to the point of stress fractures.

I did gain weight when I moved to anorexic b/p because my anorexia was often under 500 calories a day and a binge could take me to 1000 or 1500 and ‘only’ purging with laxatives achieved no real weight loss. But my lowest weight was low enough it took time to even gain enough weight to hit 18.5 BMI. 

My highest weight ultimately was 26.7 and by then I was more EDNOS due to strongly avoidant restrictive behaviours, food hoarding and being in treatment of a ‘weight stabilising’ diet for underweight anorexics despite being 23.5 BMI at start. By then I binged less but purged more as it was self harm I was after not weight loss. Came off the treatment plan at highest weight with medical issues and restricted immediately with no b/p. 

I struggle to keep my ducks in a row of restrict, binge and purge without whack a mole of one popping up when I think I have them all in line. My aim is always weight loss but for me straight up restriction is easy. It doesn’t punish me. It makes me euphoric/manic and unaware of its harm. I have to add the b/p to make it hard and feel it instead of just make it easy. My weight has not gone up in 5 years. Still working on totally erradicating restrict-binge-purge tendencies. I get my high off not eating, never hide eating and have no binge/purge triggers but multiple restriction triggers.

It’s a weird one. My bulimic GF can put away thousands of calories in a binge picking specific food easy to purge, only purges through vomiting and has much more obviously disordered eating habits to the untrained eye than me such never eating proper meals, obsessive sugar consumption, food reptitions, hidden eating, night eating and asking for trigger foods to be physically hidden. Her motivation is not weight loss but to use binge/purge as a pressure valve for emotion. 

She wants to numb her self with binges and then remove the need to be numbed by purging it all out. She struggles with impulse control, gets proper ‘hits’ off certain foods and her bulimia is like self sabotage for strong feelings. Her binges/purges are much more infrequent than mine but mine are like mini events compared to her hours long ones.

"gaza76q","OP, I’d like to offer some advice as someone who was in your friends shoes years ago.

In my early 20s, I was dating a guy and drunkenly cheated on him several times while he was studying abroad. This is something I’m still very ashamed of and regret to this day. I was out of control, drinking too much and unaware of my actions. We ended up breaking up later on, but I always respected how my friend handled things. 

I had a close friend that was in your position. I was very unhappy in the relationship and would complain to her about very trivial things my then bf did. Looking back, it seems so obvious I should have just left him. He deserved much better and I was not in love, but I tried to convince myself otherwise. My friend finally got so fed up and made it very clear she did not support my choices, the relationship, and would no longer listen to me vent about him. This allowed her to still be my friend and spend quality time without me zapping all her energy. Side note but I ended up leaving the boyfriend and can honestly say I have never cheated again several relationships and years later. Once a cheater always a cheater is not always true. You can hate the sin but love the sinner. However, she needs to do some serious self reflection and work on being a better person. If you don’t see any signs of progression after some time, your best bet is to cut ties. 

But I honestly think this is the best thing you can do. The next time your friend brings up her bf, be very clear and say although you love her, you don’t support her cheating and no longer want to hear about her relationship (unless she is working toward bettering herself). I do not recommend telling the boyfriend. That will only create a bigger mess. Chances are they are going to break up anyways because she obviously is not 100% happy. You will 100% lose your friend.

If people are energized about some issue, they will elect people who say the right things about that issue and embarrass politicians who don't.  And if the protests are big enough, it forces people to confront the issue head-on.  If a handful of people are writing letters to the editor about blah, you might hear about it and dismiss it immediately, but most likely you won't hear about it at all.  But if there's a really big protest, especially if there's controversy about it, you *will* hear about it and it will be one of the most pressing issues of the day, and you'll pretty much have to come up with an opinion because it's what everyone else is talking about.

"gam82az","Was camping, late at night, drinking and blazing, and chatting with a girl I'd known for years. I knew she was into me but for various reasons I didn't return the interest. Well, that night we were pretty gunned and she somehow ended up sitting on my lap, and booze doing what it does, I was feeling a little more inclined to.... see where things went. She's sitting under a blanket with me and... exploring with her hands, as am I.

Then out of nowhere she stood up, and loudly announced to those left around the fire that she was going to the bathroom and then to bed, and left. 

I thought that was pretty odd considering we'd literally just had our hands inside each other's clothing under this blanket, and being currently stuck with a raging hard-on after she'd been grinding on my lap, I wasn't too impressed, so I rolled a joint and griped about this situation to my buddy who came over and asked why I wasn't sleeping with her right now.

Well, 20 or 30 minutes later I decided I'd hit the sack too, it was well after midnight anyway and, to be quite frank, I needed to get some release for myself after she worked me up earlier.

Head back to my tent and find a note, with a condom pinned to it, that says ""bring this to my tent with a joint and we'll fuck all night"". Immediate reaction: 'fuck yeah!', followed shortly by 'wait, did she pin it THROUGH the condom?! She did! Weird.' 

I decided at that point to go to bed, since I was kinda pissed at her for ditching me by the fire with a massive hard-on anyway, already wasn't that interested in the first place, and the pin through the condom was a weird flag for me, to top it all off. Could've been an honest mistake, but we were mid 20's and both sexually experienced, not like 15 years old and unaware of the problem putting a fucking hole in your condom can cause.

This is already getting long enough so I'll spare you the drama the following morning, but suffice to say she was not at all happy I did not come find her for sexy times, not at all. I didn't really care though, the drama was confirming my decision the night before was a good one.

She moved away a couple years later, and quite some time after she moved I found out from some of our other common friends that she wanted to have my baby and was hoping to like... trick me into it somehow with booze, weed and ""protected"" sex that night. 

So yeah, pretty weird, and super happy I dodged a bullet there. Honestly, had she just whispered in my ear by the fire that she wanted to fuck me, and then brought me back to her tent and used a faulty condom, I might've had a baby on the way with someone I didn't even like.

"gah4y67","OS Level virtualisation is absolutely a real thing, and has been for decades. You don't have to emulate the entire hardware platform for it to be considered virtualisation.

Instead of the virtual layer being at emulated hardware for multiple kernels to boot, you are presenting consistent kernel interfaces to multiple discrete userspace instances.

There is a very interesting presentation on YouTube from a few years ago at a Couchbase conference by Bryan Cantrill, when he was still at Joyent, going into the details of hardware vs OS level virtualisation and the pros and cons for each.

From VMware's own glossary they acknowledge the different types:

Three Kinds of Server Virtualization:

Full Virtualization: Full virtualization uses a hypervisor, a type of software that directly communicates with a physical server's disk space and CPU. The hypervisor monitors the physical server's resources and keeps each virtual server independent and unaware of the other virtual servers. It also relays resources from the physical server to the correct virtual server as it runs applications. The biggest limitation of using full virtualization is that a hypervisor has its own processing needs. This can slow down applications and impact server performance.

Para-Virtualization: Unlike full virtualization, para-virtualization involves the entire network working together as a cohesive unit. Since each operating system on the virtual servers is aware of one another in para-virtualization, the hypervisor does not need to use as much processing power to manage the operating systems.

OS-Level Virtualization: Unlike full and para-virtualization, OS-level visualization does not use a hypervisor. Instead, the virtualization capability, which is part of the physical server operating system, performs all the tasks of a hypervisor. However, all the virtual servers must run that same operating system in this server virtualization method.",1603966013,"the hypervisor monitors the physical server's resources and keeps each virtual server independent and unaware of the other virtual servers.","independent and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"independent and unaware","independent",NA,NA,0

That's not the only one either, there have been several that occurred, including this year. The [two halves of the American Eclipse](https://nationaleclipse.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/map_usa_2017_20244.png?w=656) also are extremely relevant (judgement on and the fall of America)

The two signs at the beginning of Revelation 12 have at least THREE layers to them (i'm simplifying them below).

1. the ""woman"" represents Israel throughout the OT
2. also represents virgin mary (a Roman Catholic has no hope of seeing beyond this interpretation, which is also the least important of them all)
3. the literal celestial alignment in the heavens (the Red Dragon one is next too)

When it comes to prophetic matters, most here are **totally** blind and unaware of the lateness of the hour. They will be caught ""unaware"" just as Paul warned us not to be, and do not ""watch"" as Jesus commanded us multiple times to do.

It's quite sad really, this is the most ""christiany"" forum reddit has to offer, which says a lot imo.

Considering that about 1/3 of the Bible is made up of prophetic verses, you would think the quantity of it would cause others to pay more attention to it. God WANTS His people to know what's happening, what's coming, and where we are at. 

We SHOULDN'T be oblivious to these things. That's also a fulfillment of prophecy in and of itself though, the state of the Church at the end of the age, lukewarm, apostate, lovers of themselves... 

Their eyes are gonna be opened up soon enough though, everyone's about to get rocked, whether they are prepped for it or not. Even the ""corona"" is in Bible prophecy =O)

"gae1n4e","I think the best way to present this ethical conundrum is by using the trolley problem.

There is a trolley barrelling down the railway tracks. In their path are dozens and dozens of people tied to the track. You are standing next to a set of points that will take the runaway trolley to a different set of tracks, but on those tracks is tied an adolescent child, who will die if you pull the lever. What do you do?

Now, let’s change that scenario, and say that there are two runaway trolleys, and if you pull the lever, there’s a 30% chance that the points will move late, and consequently, one trolley will continue on its path, but the second will go down the second set of tracks, killing the child but not saving the dozens of people.

Now, let’s flip the order, so it’s the child who’s tied in the path of the trolley, and the dozens of people who will die if you pull the lever. What do you do then? 

Now, let’s take this scenario, but imagine that the child is your daughter? What would you do then?

Now, imagine that in order to get to the lever that will change the tracks and save your daughter, you have to personally kill a bunch of people guarding it. What do you do then?

"gaaw0dz","Alexa didn't understand why her mother's smile looked so sad. Alexa had only brought her a picture to put on the fridge, just like any other time.

It was of a pretty woman that lived in Alexa's mind. She was very proud of it.

Her mother took the picture, staring down at it while Alexa waited. Her hands were clenched so tightly that the large thin paper was wrinkling around her fingers, making her daughter fret. She smoothed the creases she'd created and took a deep breath. Caroline couldn't let her emotions show, couldn't worry the little girl staring up at her. ""This is *very* nice, Lexy. Did you do it yourself?"" Maybe someone had given this to her?

""Uh huh!"" Alexa confirmed exuberantly unwittingly dashing her mother's brief hope. ""Her name's Calliope, isn't that pretty, mommy?""

Her mother's breath hitched and she blinked away tears. ""That's a beautiful name, darling. Why don't I... Why don't I put this on the fridge?""

Alexa grinned. ""Yay!""

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor came the next day, solemn and unsmiling as he took a seat in the living room where Alexa was playing with her dolls while she waited for Calliope to wake up and talk to her. Her new friend slept a *lot* in the bed she'd made for herself inside Alexa's head.

The doctor made her nervous, but her mother sat down beside him and told her he was a very nice man. She told Alexa to answer all of his questions.

The doctor asked her a *lot* of questions. All of them were about her new friend Calliope. What Calliope had told her, when she had first met Calliope, how often she spoke to Calliope, what Calliope was doing right now, they went on and on.

When he was finally done, he took her mother out of the room. They talked in quiet voices, but Alexa could hear a little of what they talked about through the cracked door, if she concentrated. Her mother had forgotten to close it all the way.

""-I've looked her up... epic poetry?"" Her mother was asking.

The doctor's voice was soft, but Alexa could still hear him respond. ""Over the years the Muses denominations have changed. Now it just depends on who they choose to inspire and what the Chosen do with it.""

Alexa didn't know a lot of the words the doctor used. She decided to ask Calliope later, when her friend woke up.

Caroline's voice shook as she asked, ""How long does she have? Can I... Can I make the Muse leave?""

Alexa could hear the doctor clear his throat. ""Muses will only leave when they get what they want. As for how long that will take, well... there's no real way to know for sure. Not this early. But I can tell that Calliope has taken a liking to your daughter. That could be a good thing or..."" He trailed off.

""Oh Gods."" Her mother sobbed. Alexa jolted. She didn't like it when her mother was sad. She stumbled to her unsteady feet and toddled to the door, opening it all the way so that she could throw her arms around her mother's legs.

""Don't be sad, mommy."" She glared at the doctor. Her mother had told her he was a nice man, why was he making her mother sad. He gazed back with steady eyes, unreadable. ""Do you want him to go away?""

Her mother brushed her hand over Alexa's head. ""Sweetheart..."" She said softly, then sniffled. ""Don't worry, he's not making me sad. Why don't you go back to the living room to play with your dolls while we finish talking, huh?""

Alexa sent one last scowl at the doctor before sighing. ""Alright, mommy. I love you!""

""I love you too."" Her mother said, tears in her eyes.

Alexa turned to go back into the living room as she was asked and could feel Calliope stirring in her head. She brightened. Calliope always had the *best* ideas for what to play!

The doctor left a little while later, and her mother joined her in the living room. She watched Alexa as the child babbled happily to herself, shaking the dolls in her tiny pudgy hands.

How had those hands created the near photo realistic picture that now hung in pride of place on the fridge, a beautiful woman rendered in crayon? Her daughter was only 4, why had the Muse chosen her? Why now?

She knew the prognosis, the inevitable outcome. It had taken her husband, and now it had come for her daughter.

Alexa would burn brightly, a beacon of brilliance in whatever the Muse guided her to do. But the flame of her creativity would be fueled by the Muse with Alexa's own life force until there was nothing left. Until her cheerful little girl was a husk of blank eyes and silence? Or searching desperately for the Muse that had already abandoned her in favor of her next victim... if Alexa lived through it at all.

How long would she be able to provide the kindling the Muse required?

She pressed her hand against her lips to prevent herself from alerting Alexa to her grief. She could not mourn her, not yet, not while Alexa was still so vividly alive.

Her little girl beamed at her, innocent and unaware of her own fate. This Muse, this *Calliope*, would snatch that smile away from her like the other one, Euterpe had taken her husband.

At first it was all so exciting. To be chosen by a *Muse*, it was so rare now that they had no idea of the consequences. They hadn't even thought to contact the specialized psychologist like she had done for Alexa.

Euterpe had chosen Alexander not long after they had gotten married, leading him to take up an instrument he'd never touched before. He would play for Caroline, eyes fever bright and face split with a manic smile. He went on to play in vast music halls, sharing his gift as Alexander would put it.

Caroline could still remember the aftermath, his bleeding fingertips working restlessly over the strings of his violin. Trying to please Euterpe, who was already turning her attention away from him. The frantic need he had felt to keep her. Alexander no longer played for Caroline, just for Euterpe.

Then... the day she had awoken, heavily pregnant with their daughter, next to his cooling body after Euterpe had finally abandoned him.

A month to the day later Caroline had clutched her screaming infant to her chest. She was all that remained of Alexander, a piece of him that Caroline coveted. All alone in the room they had given her in the labor ward, Caroline murmured the name she had chosen for her into her daughter's downy hair.

Was that a mistake? To name her for someone who had already been at the thrall of a Muse? Is that why Alexa had been chosen?

Was this all her fault?

Alexander had lived his life for Euterpe for 5 years, was Alexa doomed to die at *only* 9 years old?

""Mommy, I'm hungry. Is it dinner time yet?"" Alexa asked, dragging her back to the present moment. She was so much like her father. More than Caroline could have ever anticipated.

She stood, pitching forward slightly, unbalanced by her emotions. But she managed to catch herself. Caroline smiled at her daughter with slightly trembling lips. ""Not yet sweetheart. I'll go get it started, you just stay here and play with Call-"" She couldn't say it, her voice broke on the accursed name. ""Play with your friend."" She managed to choke out.

Alexa cheered as she fled the room.

"ga4ldxk","&gt;  Not really, because you hate a product you can't invalidate the experience of others.  

I cannot invalidate their experience, but I can explain it. The only way they can see YTM as superior is if they aren't really all that familiar with what has been lost via the transition to YTM.  My dog, after having been ""fixed"" as a pup, never seems to miss the opportunities denied him via a few snips and a decision made for him.  He's fat, happy, and unaware of his loss.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and I told you the Spotify is more powerful, better designed and more aesthetically pleasing the both YTM and GPM. Will be valid? 

It would be only partly true. Spotify is superior to YTM in almost every way....so are 1970s 8-track players :)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; YTM at this moment is not a final product,  

Yet they're wanting to charge us for it by replacing one that \*is\* a final product.

They've spent years developing YTM.  Yes, years....and yeah, it's not a final product. It's not even worthy of the beta status as large aspects of it simply don't work and are incompatible even with their own Google Home/Assistant ecosystem.  The level of hate towards this product his almost hilarious. For years people have been begging (and have been denied) basic changes to make it useable.  Today they brag about the few improvements that they make, yet those improvements are so basic that they should've been included in the product before it even left the actual beta stage.  I mean....sorting?  Seriously?  We can't even sort? lol  Don't even get me started on the inclusion of illegal, pirated, low quality, often mis-named 240p videos uploaded a decade ago.  These things are like a cancer and they're trying to pretend it's an added value to make it look like they have the largest collection of music.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  how look took Spotify to have basic features or Apple Music to even have a web version. 

Saying, ""Hey....those other guys suck too!"" isn't really a good way to uplift the value of YTM. The reason I was with GPM is specifically because those other streamers mostly sucked. It just so happens that YTM sucks more lol.  GPM was a solid service. Sure, it had a few areas where improvements could be made (I wish the web app had sorting features, for example), but it was lightyears beyond anything else on the web.

The reason GPM failed was not because of features, design, or technology. It was because the people who control the biggest marketing engine in history were unable to market their own product (which could've been done simply by placing a link on every single YouTube page.....and giving it a better name). The fact that they don't get this and instead believe that they have to try to be Spotify's low-IQ idiot cousin is a testament that they will never ""get it"". Somehow they are out of touch.

In no world is a disorganized, primitive, and featureless YTM service better than a feature-rich, well organized, well-designed GPM. GPM offered features to entertain both music enthusiasts and casual users.  YTM, on the other hand, offers features only for casual, shallow listeners who want to whack a big square and play music and play this week's trending music....while sitting on the toilet.",1603677701,"he's fat, happy, and unaware of his loss.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt; and i told you the spotify is more powerful, better designed and more aesthetically pleasing the both ytm and gpm.","happy, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"happy , and unaware","happy",NA,NA,0

Robin Williams' situation was well documented at the time of his death - he was unfortunately well aware of his health and that he was facing a spiral of misery.

There's the crux of the matter - you implied that no dementia patient has the cognitive ability to understand what they are going through, but we know that is not the case.

&gt;Your last statement is the weird statement, since unfortunately many people have committed suicide because of depression without dementia, as we all are aware.

&gt;A person can go from a nice, kind individual to being angry, combative and unaware of self, yet not commit suicide.

Most people with terminal illnesses die via natural causes, but that doesn't mean that the people who do commit suicide only do it due to depression, although it is a factor in a lot of cases.  Even if they do have depression and have been suicidal in the past it doesn't detract from the fact that it may have been the least worst option for them, or that the illness was the catalyst for the worsening of their mental health.

"ga1dbxn","I think the way to solve this is by not rolling characters into initiative unless they know that combat is happening. Example:

Assassin Archer: ""I sneak up and take a shot with my bow on Guard A""

Cleric: ""I move up with the archer and cast Guiding Bolt on Guard A""

Barbarian: ""I run in from the other side and attack Guard B with my axe!""

DM: ""Wait a second guys, let's roll for initiative first""

Archer: 17  
Cleric: 12  
Barbarian: 7

Round 1:  
Archer: ""I ready shot on Guard A if they notice our presence to allow my friends some time to ready their attacks""  
Cleric: ""I ready a Guiding Bolt on Guard A for when Archer shoots his first shot""  
Barbarian: ""I ready a move for when combat begins""

Round 2:  
Archer: ""I take a shot at guard A"". Guard A is surprised and unaware of the attacker so it's at advantage. At the same time Cleric's readied Guiding Bolt goes off, also at advantage on the surprised Guard A. Also at the same time Barbarian moves 30ft towards Guard B.  
At this point the guards are aware of combat and they roll into initiative:  
Guard A: 20  
Archer: 17  
Cleric: 12  
Barbarian: 7  
Guard B: 5  
It's still Archer's turn and he gets his second attack since he's level 5 and takes another shot on the still-surprised Guard A, but not at advantage since the guard now knows about the Archers presence and location.  
Guard A has the highest initiative and gets to go next, he was surprised and does nothing on his turn but is now no longer surprised.  
Cleric goes next and casts a Sacred Flame on Guard A, who is no longer surprised and aware of his attackers.  
Barbarian goes next and runs another 30ft and attacks Guard B with his axe. Guard B is still surprised at this point.

Over 70% of the USA is deficient in this vital nutrient. Coincidence? Not when the freakin FDA is still ONLY RECOMMENDING 600 IU (daily)....y’all need to start critical thinking a bit more and wake up! This is all by design. The healthcare system is profiting off of millions of people being ‘sick’, when in actuality, many are just extremely deficient in a super powerful vitamin/hormone that is responsible for preventing cancer, dozen of auto immune functions, depression/anxiety, and SO MUCH MORE. But wait? We have scientists and experts that have actually determined that 600IU is WAY off and we actually should be taking in 1000IU PER EVERY 25lb of body weight instead?? That means a 200lb person should actually be taking at least 8,000IU a day....well, if we know this information, and it’s been provided to the FDA....then why hasn’t the National recommendation been changed from 600iu daily to much higher? I’ll wait......
Again, over 70% of the country is deficient in a vitamin/hormone that will literally throw your entire system out of wack, if you don’t have a sufficient amount in your blood...this should be concerning to everyone, yet...it’s just swept under the rug.

First time posting here so apologies for any mistakes-

So I recently got 4 kittens from a coworker’s mother, who feeds a feral mama cat and who keeps giving birth at their home. She recently had one last litter and I took 4 out of 6 of them.

Originally I was only going to get 1, since I wasn’t sure how I’d take to a new cat since my last one (a very old, 18+ year black cat who loved me to pieces) passed away this year. I ended up leaving with 2, and then went back for another 2...Now, I will say the last 2 weren’t originally my idea. My mother wanted one, and then my sister did, but we didn’t want to break up any of the kittens as much as possible since they’re so young (Theyre about 2 months now). So our solution was to have the 4 and when me and my sister move to a new apartment together, we take 2 and both pairs still have play buddies.

That WAS the plan, until I quickly realized I was the only one doing any actual care for them.

Feeding, litter training, vet visits and bills, all the costs of items and toys, cleaning up after them, bathing them, and being really the only one they get affection from since no one else is home enough for the kittens to even know who they are and feel comfortable to approach. We’re set to move into a new apartment this Friday, and my mother is under the idea that she’s keeping 1 kitten and giving the other one to her ex-husband, who I may mention is an alcoholic.

Personally, I don’t trust him within an inch of my life. The alcoholism makes him neglectful and unaware of his surroundings. My mother has stated she doesn’t even like cats, but somehow felt that one calling to her. She’s also not home for days at a time, and has a young son who is incredibly impulsive and, having seen plenty interactions between them before, is not that great with them. Neither my mother nor sister have had much, if any, time dedicated to them. While my sister isn’t an issue, since she is moving with me anyway, I have hesitation with my mother and stepfather.

I feel I am rightfully apprehensive about letting the two kittens go, and not only that but be separated as well. They’ve imprinted on me, I’ve been the only one to care for them, and honestly I’m a crazy cat lady...They’re my babies. I can afford their costs, I have the time for them, and I have plenty of love to give. Am I the asshole for asking to keep all 4, despite the original plan?

&gt;[Letter 36](http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_bahai_administration#letter36)

&gt;To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís

&gt;of the United States and Canada. Dearly-beloved fellow-workers:

&gt;I have on two recent occasions given expression to the profound sense of inspiring confidence and joyous gratitude which recent happenings in the Cause--evident manifestations of the steady evolution of a living Faith--must needs evoke in the heart of every thoughtful and observing believer. And as I contemplate the far-reaching possibilities involved in a careful handling of those forces which Bahá'u'lláh's almighty arm has now released, I cannot help reflecting upon the dominant share which the American friends, at home as well as in distant lands, have contributed to this rejuvenation of the Cause of God, and the decisive part it is theirs to play in its eventual victory.

&gt;Your letters, dated June 17, July 11, July 20, August 3 and 16, and October 2, 1926, all of which have been forwarded during my days of retirement and rest, have proved an added source of thankfulness, of joy and strength to me. They have clearly revealed by their spirit, as well as by the nature and variety of their contents, the sustained devotion, the unabated confidence, and the increasing vigor and efficiency with which you are initiating, coordinating, and consolidating the manifold activities of the Cause in North America.

 &gt;**International Secretariat**

&gt;The range and character of the problems confronting you, as revealed by the careful perusal of the minutes of your meetings, the steady increase in the number and effectiveness of vigorously functioning Centers in Central and Northern Europe, and the growing significance and complexity of the work that has to be necessarily conducted from the Holy Land, have all served to strengthen the feeling of absolute necessity for the formation in Haifa of some sort of an International Bahá'í Secretariat, which both in an advisory and executive capacity will have to aid and assist me in my vast and exacting labors. I have anxiously considered this important matter in all its bearings during the past few months, and have accordingly requested three well-informed, capable representatives from America, Europe and the East to visit the Holy Land this fall, that we may lay down the foundation of this vitally needed institution. We shall take counsel together and decide, not only upon the measures that have to be promptly undertaken to meet the pressing demands of the present hour, but upon the wider issues that on one hand will strengthen the ties that should bind the International Center of the Cause with the world at large, and on the other provide for the preliminary steps that will eventually lead to the proper establishment of the First International House of Justice.

&gt;It is my earnest hope and prayer that this exchange of thought and close cooperation in the work that has henceforth to be internationally and vigorously conducted, will enable me to participate more minutely and effectively in the labors of the various administrative departments of your Assembly, and thus reinforce the splendid efforts you are exerting for the extension of its influence and the widening of its scope.

&gt;**Plan of Unified Action**

&gt;From the report of the National Treasurer, setting forth the account of the progress of the contributions of the American believers for the support of the Plan of Unified Action, up to June 30, 1926, I gather that the result has by no means exceeded our expectations, nay has considerably fallen below what I confidently expected it to achieve. I earnestly renew my plea and appeal to you, and through you to every true and faithful lover of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, to realize, while there is yet time, the far-reaching possibilities with which the present situation is fraught. I am firmly convinced that this Plan combines, embodies, and serves the twofold purpose of the present-day Bahá'í administration in the United States and Canada, namely the promotion of the vitally needed teaching work, and the provision for the gradual completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, both wishes so near and dear to our beloved Master's heart. It is the only effective, feasible, and practical instrument placed in our hands for the speedy accomplishment of our ends. So much that is vital to the future welfare, the effectiveness, and the fair name of our beloved Cause depends, I assure you, upon the success or failure of this nobly-conceived, this sound and befitting enterprise. The eyes of all Bahá'ís and of many sympathizers throughout the world are turned towards you, eager to reinforce your accomplishments in this field, expectant to witness what measure of success you are capable of achieving.

&gt;**World Unity Conferences**

&gt;In connection with the series of World Unity Conferences which you have initiated and so laboriously organized, I feel that in order to reap the fullest advantage and benefit from this laudable effort, it is absolutely essential to follow up with the aid of enlightened, experienced and capable teachers the interest which has been aroused. Such a group of teachers should judiciously select those few among the many interested, and endeavor with patience and sympathy and by constant intimate personal intercourse, to prepare them gradually for the entire and unreserved acceptance of the fundamentals of the Bahá'í Revelation. If the results be meagre, if the attendance be small, let us not despair, nor relax in our efforts. Let us remember that this sound method will eventually triumph, if we only consistently support it, and persevere in undertaking those subsequent steps that can alone produce full and permanent benefit.

&gt;**Appeal to the Sháh of Persia**

&gt;I have already expressed my grateful appreciation of the prompt and wise measures you have taken in behalf of our oppressed and down-trodden brethren in Persia. The noble appeal which you were moved to address to His Majesty the Sháh, so illuminating, so courteous, so powerful, and the wide range of publicity you have undertaken, were truly providential in character, and will undoubtedly prove an inspiration and solace to those who still continue to be trampled under the heel of an odious and inveterate enemy. I have had your appeal translated into Persian and sent to all Centers throughout the Orient that the suffering in Persia may learn of your bold and courageous intervention, and witness the signs of their promised redemption which, as foretold by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, must first be made manifest through the efforts of their brethren in that great freedom-loving Republic of the West.

&gt;It is sad and distressing to reflect that, notwithstanding the repeated appeals addressed to the authorities concerned, and so powerfully reinforced by the spontaneous action of some of the leading Governments of the West, Persia, still heedless and unaware of the spiritual forces that are at work, continues to treat with indifference and contempt the most loyal, innocent and law-abiding subjects of its realm. The chronic instability of its affairs, the changing fortunes of factions and shadowy personalities that sap its vitality and tarnish its name, the acute and widespread economic depression that is now prevailing, and the grave discontent of the masses of the people, all tend to aggravate a situation already highly threatening to the security of its sorely tried children. What else can we do but pray most fervently that the almighty power of Bahá'u'lláh may soon triumph over this petty strife, this age-long tyranny, and make, as He prophesied, of the land of His birth, ""the most honored of all governments, the pride, the admiration and the envy of the peoples of the world.""

There's an almost naive idealism here and a kind of belief that democracy will always just be there or that things like the SC will actually protect it against a population that supports a despot like Trump.

Doesn't matter the class, the issue is just that a slow driver in a slower class will get passed by more people during a race than a slow driver in a faster class, so there's more potential chances for incidents. Saying that, from the perspective of an lmp2 driver, by far the worst are back of the pack lmp2 drivers.

These men make her feel special. They make her feel wanted. They make her feel ""grown up."" She likely thinks that she's an amazing girl because ""so many older men want me"" or something of that sort.   

I don't talk about it because I'm old enough where I don't really think about it, but when I was young I was absolutely groomed by older men online. This was in the days of AOL chatrooms, so it was still ""new"" - at least digitally.  

The men always made sure to try and get you to keep it a secret. They always told you how you were special. How you were an adult. How they understood that your parents treated you like a child, but they knew you were so much more. They'd love bomb you heavily to gain your affection. This was before you could really transfer money online with ease, so they used affection to get to you.   

Usually it was because you had low self-esteem, but you were also naive and unaware of how ""wrong"" it was.

You may also have to be extremely harsh about how all of this will 100% negatively impact her life. Maybe find stories out there of other children who were groomed and make her read their stories so she sees the damage it does.

"g8ls74k","Well I don’t know if it still applies to this thread anymore but why not? Time to share too much. Also a heads up probably gonna be NSFW.

I guess it applies to the story, so I’m bi-curious and was very open to new sexual endeavors with my gf at the time. As many young horny couples do, we were making out in the car. It has been a long 2 weeks due to opposing schedules with work and school that we were able to have contact, let alone be intimate. Before things escalate very far, she tells me she’s on her period. So no sex I assume, and I’m fine with that. However she pulls out a condom and I get very confused. I ask why she’s pulling that out if I’m not gonna use it. Her response will forever be burned into my brain. “Cause I’m the one using it.”

Now I knew that my gf at the time was way more experienced than me, so I was both nervous and excited, while also still a little dumb and unaware of what was to come. It finally clicked when she rolled the condom onto her pointer and middle fingers and playfully snapped it like it was a latex glove.

I honestly wanted to back out at first considering I’ve never done anything like that. Then her fingers moved downward and it is one of the few times I’ve shivered with anticipation from sex. She was gentle and it hurt at first until got to the middle knuckle I believe. She moved her fingers in a motion that would replicate a motion meaning “come here”. I actually yelped not expecting it to feel so good.

So there I was in the back of a small 2005 Nissan Sentra getting tugged and fingered at the same time. Now I’m usually a top and even if I’m not I tend to be more dominant, however she had me in the palm of her hand (more or less). She even got me to beg for her to continue. In the two years we dated she never had shown such a dominant side, and hadn’t done it again. It was incredibly hot. I remember being super close when she started to suck me. At that point my senses were all over.

I was actually drooling from the pleasure and wasn’t saying words coherently. When her mouth met my lower zone it felt like electricity went into the tip, to my feet, then shot up my spine giving me this strange hot/ cold sensation that I’ve only felt from the medication they give you before a Catscan, but it actually felt good here. As I was finishing I could feel my pulse in my ears and in her mouth. My hearing started to go quiet then then the sense of feeling went. I want to say it was almost like an out of body experience. Then I saw that dark static and tried mumbling something about it and woke up 25 minutes later literally with her caring about to call 911. I woke up and said something about her being too pretty to cry and she put her head on my chest and hugged me. 

I had this warm tingling feeling throughout my body and my hearing still wasn’t too good. She asked what happened and I told her what I felt and she got this really confident smile like she was proud after realizing I wasn’t dead. Although we did have a falling out, I’m glad she was my first in many aspects and I’m grateful for our time together. Even though it wasn’t always the best there was always fun. This happened about a year or so after that pill story. As for the nut 20 out of 10 would do again if I knew how.

&gt;“Man can ‘survive’ in appallingly anti-continuum conditions, but his well-being, his joy, his fulfillment as a whole human being, can be lost.  From many points of view he might be better off dead, for the life force, in its ceaseless tending toward repair of damage and completion of developmental phases, among its instruments employs anxiety, pain, and an array of other ways of signaling that things are wrong.  Unhappiness in all its forms is the result. In civilization, a frequent outcome of the operating of the system is constant misery.”

&gt;“All one can discover from horizon to horizon are victims of victims.”  
&gt;  
&gt;""A man who spends his necessary, unenjoyed working life among papers and ideas will re-create his innate expectation of physical work through something like golf. Unmindful that its main virtue is uselessness, the golfer trudges about in the sun carrying a heavy load of clubs and every so often brings his attention to a sharp focus on the problem of persuading a ball to fall into a hole in the ground: this is done, very inefficiently, with the end of one of the clubs, not by carrying the ball and dropping it in. If he were made to do all this by force, he would feel sorely put upon, but as it is called recreation and is guaranteed to serve no purpose beyond exercising him, he is free to enjoy it as the Yequana (tropical rain-forest tribe) enjoy useful work. But there are now many golfers who have allowed the labour-saving impulse to spell some of this pleasure as well, since it has been suggested by the relevant sector of the culture that carrying the clubs is not pleasant and, more recently, that the trudging between strokes ought also to be moved into the work category and little automotive carts used instead.

"g8ho33e","FA here! 

It's very difficult to balance both wanting to be close to someone while also being scared of being close. 

When I am hyper vigilant and unaware of it, I attach a lot of meaning subconsciously to a partners behavior, in an effort to assess ""am I safe? Can I trust?"". On days that I lack self-confidence, I tend to see things through a self-defeating lense, which is not a partner's fault but it deactivates me. I become a bit introverted and shy when I am in this mood. 

I also feel guilty to ask for my needs to be met, and I have an automatic assumption that my partner will not listen to me. I tend to hoard tension until a critical tipping point is reached. I will try to connect with my partner on my needs, but my automatic assumptions that I feel guilty about asking for my needs and I won't be listened to and I am risking abandonment, make me stumble and fall short on giving a secure and thorough explanation to my partner. Them, failing to pick up on what I need because they're not mind readers, or being spooked by this sudden emotional appeal, will then also confirm my wounds that I am not seen and understood. 

Once an attempt has been made without success, a number of things might happen. Usually, I go back to avoidant strategies. Sometimes I get also outwardly pissed off. If my fear barometer reaches tilt, I can spontaneously break up. 

I've discovered I am FA because of a break-up 2 years ago. I was already doing therapy and was into psychology to work on other traumas before I discovered attachment theory, so I was at a good time to have an open-minded and introspective reflection on the relationship. I could see the way I deactivated back then crystal clear, and how hypocritical I was towards avoidant partner for ""not being communicative"", when I did not communicate from a secure, authentic and honest place either. 

In most previous break-ups I just disliked and was angry with my partners (they did deserve it, I've attracted a few cluster B-personality disordered boyfriends in the past).

"g8eyabn","If you give the MT a good headstart (30s is usually fine, I tend to give them longer) and still take aggro without Provoke, it's not you doing ""too much"" damage (no such thing aside from some really high level mechanics where you need to not kill a thing), it's the MT being clueless and doing too little. If this happens, you can Shirk when you start getting too close. If you're still taking aggro after that, you're dealing with a real piece of work, and at that point you can suck it up and start toggling tank stance off when you're getting too close (usually recommended, since you won't know how the other tank will react), or just let it happen and take aggro (bad idea in some duties no matter how the other tank behaves):

* If the other tank is at least a bit smart, they'll just let you take the aggro, as they'll see it happens without any Provoking - and if that happens, this is the better solution, as one tank doing higher damage (by that big of a margin) often also correlates to better handling defensive tools and/or better gear (thus better survival) and thus doing better as MT helping healers, and results in overall easier enmity management for both.
* However, if the other tank is not only clueless about rotation, but also stubborn and unaware of their surroundings, they may try to fight you for that aggro with Provokes, which will cause an aggro war that nobody will like, least of all the rest of your team. While the other outcome can make ""just stick to tank stance"" a better approach, due to this also being a possibility, it's *safer* to take the ""guess I'll just go out of my way to let you have it"" option, as the aggro war is often a bigger negative than the appropriate change of tank roles is a positive.",1602382585,"* however, if the other tank is not only clueless about rotation, but also stubborn and unaware of their surroundings, they may try to fight you for that aggro with provokes, which will cause an aggro war that nobody will like, least of all the rest of your team.","stubborn and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"also stubborn and unaware","stubborn",NA,"also",0

No other supe has the kind of powers and capability as Homelander.  And now he finds out that he has fathered a son who is just like him. HE ISNT ALONE ANYMORE!!!

"g82aems"," Last night I went on to the sex offender registry and went through the list of names to find the most vulnerable one. I found one after around 2 hours. It was a 32-year-old man 130 pounds and had diabetes. I knew that he would put up little resistance since he was weak and legally not allowed to own a gun. That night I drove over to his house and scouted out a couple of potential entry points. I finally decided to push in the hall fan in one of the 1st story windows, and I waited until all the lights in the neighborhood were out before doing so. Once I got inside the house I looked around for any potential animals. I had completely forgotten to check if he had any dogs, but luckily I didn't see any. I started down the hallway and went up the stairs. I stepped on the edge of each step so as not to make any noise. Once I came to the bedroom, I saw that his door was wide open and that I could see him laying there quiet and unaware of the fate that was to befall him. I pulled out my knife and stepped quietly into the room. I walked right up to him and reached over holding the knife to his throat. By this point he was awake, but he and I both knew that if he screamed I would cut out his vocal cords. I sat there for a while feeling him quiver under my arm, but then I knew what I had to do. I raised up the knife and stabbed him as much as I physically could. After around the 12th time, I knew he was dead, but part of me wouldn't let the other part stop, so I kept stabbing into his chest with all my might. By the time I was out of breath and exhausted I had stabbed him 54 times, and I was covered head to toe in his blood. All the blood and gore gave me a boner the size of the Eifel Tower, and I proceeded to fuck the body.

"g80417t","I know we have all talked about Storm's ""history of sleepwalking"" in here. I have commented previously based on my own experience with a husband who legitimately does sleepwalk about how highly unlikely it is that what happened to precious B had anything to do with that. I still stand by what I have said before, but I wanted to share a weird thing that happened last night. 

So my husband has sleep walked/talked only a handful of times in our 14+ years together, and the closest he's ever gotten to physically moving objects was once when he went to the refrigerator and wanted to take the light bulb out (he didn't, but he opened it and was talking about needing to do something with ""the light""). Usually he either gets out of bed or sits up and just starts talking to me without making any sense and eventually goes back to sleep. This morning though, sometime around maybe 1:30, he kinda nudged me but didn't get up right away. Then he came over to my side of the bed, rubbed my head, and was asking about ""the thing"" - I kept asking him about what thing he was referring to, and he couldn't tell me. He kept pointing to where the baby monitor charger was, so I asked him if that was it, to which he replied that it wasn't. At one point he was like, ""I think I might be dreaming again"" and I told him that he probably was. He went on for a few minutes trying to communicate what he was concerned about, and eventually I determined that he was looking for our infant son (who is 6.5 months old) and wanted to make sure he wasn't in our bed and that he hadn't fallen in the space between the bed and nightstand (he didn't say this exactly, but I was able to deduce it from what he was able to get out). I told him our son was asleep in his own room in his crib and hadn't been in our bed at all, and to check the monitor if he wanted to see for himself (why I was trying to reason with someone who wasn't fully there I don't know, but at that point I didn't really know for sure if he was awake or not). He didn't check the monitor, but I guess he was satisfied with my answer and went back to his side of the bed.

Our son had cried out and put himself back to sleep not long before this, so I am wondering if maybe hearing him on the monitor is what triggered my husband's dream. He has had the recurring dream of not being able to find our baby in the sheets several times, but not for quite awhile (it happened a lot when we first came home), and he hasn't actually gotten out of bed to look for him. Our son has never slept in our bed EVER, but I am curious now after this whole thing if my husband would ever actually get our son out of his crib and bring him into bed with us...? I'd like to think not, but I guess it's possible. Even so, though, I think most of us can agree it's much more likely that Amy and/or Storm were both just highly intoxicated in their situation, as it's been divulged that alcohol was involved (my husband and I were both completely sober, by the way). I find it very hard to believe that a sober Amy or even tipsy Amy wouldn't have woken up from that, even if Storm was legitimately asleep and unaware of what he was doing. She had to have been passed out drunk - not just ""had a little too much"" drunk, like completely blacked out, borderline alcohol poisoning status. Maybe some moms would have slept through that entire thing, but I wake up to almost every little noise or movement these days and have been a pretty light sleeper most of my life anyways. I probably would have jolted out of bed if I'd realized my husband legitimately gotten our son out of his crib and brought him in bed with us, even in an exhausted, sleep-deprived, new mom state. And Storm had to have been equally or even more drunk in my opinion to have ""no clue"" how it happened. Even when my husband does this kind of thing, he usually at least has a vague memory of it the next day.

I know we have mentioned Amy going on her stories talking about having this exact dream and other moms in here have chimed in about having it as well. My sister in law also had this dream when my niece was little many times. It's fairly common. But what is so weird to me is that B died not long after this dream because of a ""co-sleeping incident."" She made such a big deal out of it her followers and vowed to the Instagram world that she would never bring her babies into bed with her, but somehow B ""ended up"" in their bed. Bizarre. 

Anyway, probably a longer comment than it needed to be, but I immediately thought of Amy and Storm when this happened and just can't imagine the pain of realizing your worst nightmare had come true.",1602079121,"i find it very hard to believe that a sober amy or even tipsy amy wouldn't have woken up from that, even if storm was legitimately asleep and unaware of what he was doing.","asleep and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"legitimately asleep and unaware","asleep",NA,"legitimately",0

Post-independence India is an incredibly bizarre period to me. ALL the ruling class elites adopted atheistic/nihilistic Marxist theories from post WW2 France/Germany, rather copy-pasted them, and used those ideologies on a population that was literally starving. And they used it in such a way that those that were starving suddenly became oppressors, and the ruling class elites became the oppressed. So the News anchor sitting in AC rooms became the oppressed and the Hindu farmers that were toiling away, barely able to feed their families became the radical fundamentalist that were ruining the nation. That is the elites themselves labeled themselves as oppressed to retain power and control, and used imported ideology to shroud their hatred of Hinduism but at the same time justify it. What a truly genius and diabolical strategy. The Hindus were entirely and completely preoccupied and unaware of this, they still are to a large degree, but intuitively there is a clear awakening happening. 

Hindu intellectual class is rising and that’s why they actually hate Arnab. He’s not only doing a better job than them at their own game, but undermining their entire life’s work and value system that was unjustly and coercively applied to a preoccupied and naive people.

My parents separated when I was 2. I’m 32 now. My dad is a pervert and an alcoholic. My older sister (different mother) went to live with him in her teenage years and she went off the a mental asylum for trying to commit suicide. He was not focused on her academics or work ethics though. He was focused on himself. She’s been in and out of jail and lost custody of all 3 of her children. I think a lot of what happened to her is because of her life with my dad. I can think of ways that even I blame my mom and step dad for stupid decisions now that anger me and frustrate me and make me tired because I see their future and it’s full of debt and impulsive decisions. My point is that I think that it is normal to disagree with your family and not want to be around them all of the time anymore. It’s a natural part of the process of our growth.

So the world too often seizes upon one of its aspects, examines it, and pronounces it good. But it is like the case of the ear, the eye, the nose, and the mouth: each has its own kind of understanding, but their functions are not interchangeable. In the same way, the various skills of the hundred schools all have their strong points, and at times each may be of use. But none is wholly sufficient, none is universal.

"g72x11w","Honestly, you're going to lose most of the appeal of the Advantage/Disadvantage system. Players are going to start scrounging for any source of advantage they can get, and ways to impose disadvantage on their enemies. Adv/Disad is intended to avoid tallying up how many +1, -2, +4, -3, +2 modifiers each side can come up with; if you start to tally up Adv/Disad you're taking a step back towards that paradigm.

As for how it will play out, I think generally speaking you're going to end up with a lot more rolls being made at advantage, mostly on the player's side. Players have the entire round to try to come up with ways to eke an additional source of advantage while the DM is going to need to juggle the entire combat and probably can't take the time to make deep tactical decisions for each monster.

You'll probably see a somewhat slower combat as people look for ways to maximize their rolls and avoid rolling disadvantage or straight, and as people need to look up and adjudicate how many different effects grant advantage or disadvantage. Attacking a restrained, unconscious, prone opponent 5ft away- is that 4 sources of advantage (restrained target, unseen attacker, unconscious target, prone target) or should it be 2 sources (restrained target, unconscious target) since the unconscious condition includes the effects of prone and unaware of surroundings?

"g727yik","Setting the scene: All gens are done, 4 survivors alive, I am chasing a survivor while keeping eyes on the doors. I see Nancy opening the nearest door while I am looping this pallet.

1. Ideally you are chasing someone when the gens get done. Everyone knows you are in chase so they will bolt to the door. Keep watching the doors while chasing. 
2. When the doors are 99 you need to run to the door. Ideally you down the person you were just chasing. Leaving a slug adds pressure to the person by the door. There is almost always a person waiting there. They see you (!), turn to open the door, and the second they do, you leave the area. Go back to your slug. No one has ever continued out the door when I do this. This is why I said confused. They continue to stand there after opening the door for me wondering what to do, hence, confused.
3. The hardest part is keeping them in the game. That slug you left may already be up so you need to get back there and try a couple things depending on situation. You need to be chasing someone ***poorly.*** The idea is to run down the clock. So just slugging everyone would take forever as that slows the EGC timer. So running down the clock through chases is ideal. What does chase poorly mean? Normally you want to end a chase ASAP right? But here you want them to last as long as possible. While looping a pallet don't break it, even when you normally would, keep looping them. They want you to break the pallet so they can leave the loop. You aren't going to let them. Block them from getting anywhere, they want that fast window vault? deny it,  you are running out the clock.  If you need to slug for more pressure you can. Just remember that will slow the timer so you want them to get that person up if you need the timer to move faster. Basically you want to look like a bad campy gamer. Makes the team get close and unaware of your plans. They want to save the one person from ""the bb killer who tunnels."" When they don't respect you they dance around in your face. Perfect. This all works best against SWF or super altruistic gamers. In fact this method was made just for SWF.
4. Now once the timer reaches half way it's GO time. DO NOT HOOK AT THIS POINT! You will lose. Just get ready. This is the part I have tested over and over and over. 
5. Probably the most important part: **you need to hook your target person when the timer is 40-45%** **AND you need to let them unhook IMMEDIATELY.** Don't camp the hook, don't attack anyone, don't be cheeky, JUST LEAVE THE ABSOLUTE SECOND YOU HOOK. Seriously. Act like you don't even see the other survivors. You want them to unhook ASAP, because as soon as they unhook.... they have sealed their fate and they are all dead. The unhook, restarts the EGC timer increasing its speed. So don't go downing them again because the timer will slow down.
6. After the unhook: congrats you have just pulled off a PB. NOW you can be cheeky and dance around the survivors as they realize what just happened. There is nothing they can do. If I am Bubba I like to rev my saw while they all die around me.

And that's it. Keep in mind that every game is different so you need to adapt the strategy to the survivors play style, the map, the killer, etc. The strategy isn't super complicated but the variables you have to work with can cause a lot of problems. After all this strat depends entirely on how the survivors react to your actions. So it can be hard to do if they are not ""working"" with you.

"g71hmyu","This is going to get buried but I’ll try anyway. Living with someone with autism is a big life change. I myself am an adult with autism although I have been independent since I was 19 and have had my own place since then. I’ve done well in a very social career that has given me some great opportunities. That being said I am difficult to live with. I am moody, sometimes irrational, and very dependent on a very specific schedule. These are things that would normally affect someone’s desire to be housemates with me. All of these things are directly related to my autism and on bad days can be difficult for me to control. It can make living with me very inconvenient if not uncomfortable. All of these things being said it has been a work in progress for me to become better with these short comings, but that is very difficult if not almost impossible for someone who’s very dependent and unaware of social situations to adjust themselves to be better to live with. I know a lot of people try to up play how we with autism are just like you and we are, but in a lot of ways we are different and can have difficulty with things that a lot of people wouldn’t normally struggle with like prioritizing cleanliness and hygiene, sharing spaces and not taking over them completely because everything has to be just so, and being accepting of changes in schedule due to others needs. For a while all it took to ruin my day was having to change lunch plans because the place I always go to was closed for a private event. I’m talking borderline panic attack anxious melt down, as an actual over 21 years old adult, over lunch. It becomes exponentially more complex with some how doesn’t cope with their autism well at all. At that point you have to take note of so many preferences to avoid conflict, a lot of which may seem pointless to a neurological person, that it may very well be like having a child. It can cause a lot of strain on relationships and families when you aren’t prepared for that level of care that is often needed in more dependent adults and children with autism. I would tell your MIL to blow it out her ass because that would be a life altering change for you and your fiancé.

"g6v7qj9","It makes some things easier and some things more difficult. With my current girl and other dog (who passed) it was hard to train the second dog, he didn't get trained as well as her because it was difficult for me to manage both of them. In retrospect I could have separated them but I lived in a small house. Now I have three dogs and a large house so I just move the one in training away and cycle them out.

The older dogs also do a good job at teaching the puppy things. They're quite lazy so they've taught the puppy how to be ok being bored, and how to nap. They've taught her bite inhibition (had one really bad incident though when puppy bit old arthritic girl on her arthritic foot and pup got bit bad on the face)

Just earlier today they taught her how to be chill while getting her toenails dremelled. She's 4 months old and she had her nails dremelled once, then clipped once at the vet (not sure how that went, wasn't allowed in), then today she FREAKED OUT and was attacking us so we did their first and fed them cheese and she was so jealous. It was easier after that until she got full of snacks and was bored and started freaking out again. 

I'm not sure if it sped up potty training. She gets distracted when they're outside with her so we still do separate outside times if it's only for potty purposes (instead of play time). She could be out over an hour and forget to pee the whole time. She probably sees them only do it outside, never inside, but I don't think it's really helped much altogether.

She does play with the old arthritic girl quite a bit (old girl doesn't know how to slow down despite her pain). Not so much with the younger boy, but he's very big and unaware of his size and too rough so she gives him a wide berth. It does give me quite a bit of a break. 

They do learn each other's bad habits too though. Now I have three dogs tearing up my garden bed, and while I can yell at the older two to stop, puppy doesn't listen or care. All three of them bark at stuff - they have their own triggers - but they all start barking when another starts. Puppy is learning to beg for food, she goes overboard though, previously before watching my older dogs beg she wouldn't. Now she not only stares like they do but LAUNCHES onto us.

"g6n6n36","**Survivor U.S. Season 21 - Nicaragua**

**Russian Survivor community ranking - 35/40**

**My personal ranking - 32/40**

**My ranking of this season's players:**

**20. NaOnka Mixon (587 out of 590).** This one is another universally hated player. Socially Inadequate and unaware of her own disgusting behavior. At some point I even wondered whether she was a former drug addict because that's how they behave. Rough, rude, what else... Female Ben Browning. But Ben didn’t at least quit, so he’s little higher in the rankings. She tackled a girl with a prosthesis instead of a leg, all for the sake of a clue to a HII - in our culture that is disgusting for almost everybody. Another moment of my total contempt with her is that she didn't give up her reward, although she already knew that she was leaving - it's also a shitty act. I was extremely pleased to see how contemptuously the remaining participants and members of the jury looked at her when she was quitting and especially liked the laugh of Fabio when she suggested that her torch also should be snuffed, like the torches of all other eliminated castaways. 

**19. Jane Bright (515 out of 590).** At first I felt sorry for Jane and how her alliance kicked her out, but then I started thinking. And I realized that Janne acted like a sore loser. And I don't like sore losers. She's just one of the many people in this game that were betrayed. At least her alliance told her openly that they would vote her out, not blindside her as a fool. Fabio won immunity, what can you do... Somebody had to be voted out. Why act so childish? There is, of course, one circumstance that doesn't sit well with this, and the name of this circumstance is Dan. Why didn’t they vote hime out... He would've never won a challenge, but Jane could do it... 

**18. Wendy DeSmidt-Kohloff (445 out of 590).** Brenda was very different in her two seasons. In the first season she tried to apply Parvati's strategy of flirting, for which I didn't like her very much. However, she left earlier than I thought (Brenda's name was known to me before watching Nicaragua, so I thought she had reached Final Five or Four), and maybe didn't have enough time to influence me any more. Caramoan - I was sentimental here. Brenda has shown up with any words, by and large, in three or four of her last episodes, and I personally felt nasty when Dawn voted for her (I don't think she would've ruined her zero game if she didn't vote for her). You'll probably say, well, Brenda got Dawn's jaw out of the lake, you know, Dawn doesn't owe her life after this. No, of course she doesn't. But I still think that she could have not voted for Brenda at her boot Tribal. Especially considering how badly she was freaking out when she lost her teeth. Brenda - one Lowe! 

**17. Dan Lembo (423 out of 590).** Of course, Dan is one of the most trainwreck challenge competitors in Survivor history. And of course he made it so far into the game because he happened to find his place in the right alliances. This is on one hand. On the one hand, I was rooting for Fabio (because I wanted the underdog to win this over strategists), and Dan totally bashed both Sash and Chase at the Final Tribal Council. But still, really, I can't put a man who is not able to, like, jump and walk fast, high in my rankings. 

**16. Shannon Elkins (414 out of 590).** Objectively, I know, Shannon s\*cks. Well, like on the first day he told Chase that a woman can't win Survivor. Then, when things didn't go according to his plan and his alliance crubmbled, he dug a grave for himself at the Tribal Council. Why didn't I put him lower then, you might ask? Maybe I'm not a fan of voting out physically strong tribe members in the very first stages of the game, when you need to keep the tribe together. And secondly, Shannon planned to kick out Naonka - the trash bucket of Survivor. 

**15. Jill Behm (406 out of 590).** At the beginning of the show I couldn't differentiate between her and Jane (Jane and Jill, you know), although they are very different in appearance. Was feeling sorry for her to go in the way she actually went. Didn't like very much when Marty betrayed her in exchange for an idol (but, again, what can we say - he did not vote for her; a good one, Sash). 

**14. Jimmy Tarantino (385 out of 590).** When I look at Jimmy T, especially at his official cast photo, I really think that about fifteen or twenty years ago, he would've probably kicked Ozzy's and Joe's asses. But the time flies and sometimes it doesn't have fun. Jimmy was a way too self-centered, he didn't listen to anyone, he had hard time accepting other opinions. Of course it's difficult to live with such people. That's why I knew that the tribe would kick him out early. 

**13. Tyrone Davis (345 out of 590).** He's almost the same as Jaison from Samoa, only a little more fun and had a little bit of stronger spirit. But, oddly enough, he left much earlier than #346. Well, if I remember correctly, he didn't want to help cook the chicken, however stuffed his face in it. 

**12. Sash Lenahan (314 out of 590).** Some kind of a ""delicate"" Boston Rob from ""All Stars"". Sash made a lot of moves, alas for him, they were mainly of the burning bridges type, and this totally set the jury against him.  But, it seems to me that Nicaragua is one of those seasons in which there was an outraged bitter jury, led by the Survivor trash bucket - NaOnka.  Of course I'm not upset that Sash lost because, you know, Fabio won and I like Fabio, but still ... There is also a dark story with Jane and her mortgage... Well, let this dust sit on Sash's conscience. 

**11. Chase Rice (309 out of 590).** I personally have a neutral attitude towards this player, and I don't get mad over the fact that he lost the final, but... still, was it fair?  What can you do if the only person that was not in the majority alliance won all immunities at the end and they had to kick out their own allies? I understand that Jane and Dan were upset that they and not, let's say, Sash were expelled from the alliance. But you shouldn't be a sore loser in such circumstances - you should understand that there were a very few choices left.  Nicaragua for me is like Guatemala and Fiji - it's another confirmation that people who behave like assholes in the game turn out to be the same assholes in the jury (right Lisi, right Judd?).

If you’re right center I’m sure everything you disagree with is from the Democrats and you only pay attention to politics every four years. BLM was founded in 2013 (so right after an election) and the Ferguson riots happened in 2014 and that didn’t stop black Democratic President Barack Obama from sending in the national guard. Liberals tend to have a blind spot when it comes to the Democratic Party, but it’s adorably ignorant to think that one side of the establishment is behind it all, and equally dumb of Liberals to think a political party cares about anything beyond their vote. 

Why don’t people who are pro-life also protest drone strikes, the death penalty, or school shootings? Cause abortion is the issue they’re focused on and seek to change. That doesn’t mean they can’t care about anything else, that doesn’t mean “pro-life” has to apply to every single situation. Do you think it was hypocritical for the US to memorialize the victims of 9/11 even though way more people died that year from car crashes and heart disease?

No one from BLM is dismissing the guy who died in CHAZ and the only reason anti-BLM know about that is it fits their agenda. The issue isn’t just the individual lives it’s about justice. If a civilian murders a black person everyone is gonna think that’s bad, but the killer will get arrested and put in prison for murder. But if that person is a cop the victim doesn’t get justice. If cops were treated like everyone else who commits murder (when it’s clearly unjustified force not self defense) it wouldn’t be an issue. But apparently it’s hypocritical to care about one instance of injustice without being able to name every single black person who died. 

And people talk about improving their communities all the time to prevent crime but one one gives a shit. Sensitive whites say “but what about black on black crime?” as if every black person has been quarantined their whole life. That’s still an issue. It’s why the crime act was put forth in the 90’s. They asked for better resources and infrastructure in their community but they only got more cops. Now people in those neighborhoods gotta worry about black on black crime and cops arresting them for nothing.

It ain’t black people’s fault. It’s the media. White liberals care about BLM so much cause it’s the least they can do while publicly looking woke. It’s not like black people have otherwise been silent and unaware of their issues.

"g624zjc","Lmao. I love how extreme this is. But there is a lot of truth to it.   


When I had short hair, I attracted a certain type of woman. When I grew my hair out I immediately began attracting a completely different demographic of women.   


Sometimes, though, I doubt it's the long hair or the short hair that attracted them... But rather the act of change itself. Just the act of change made them notice you because now you look ''different'' and that's something people tend to notice.   


After I grew my hair out the women started flooding in for like a full year. And then they just kind of stopped. So I cut it all off and they came flooding in again. 

  
I really just think women phaze most men out (even if they are attractive). But when you do something that forces them to actually stop what they're doing and just notice you for a moment... That's when they realize they think you're cute.   


Change is just one way to command their attention.   


For example, I've noticed this cute female co-worker for the last 9 months at work. But she always seemed vague and unaware of me. I'd walk past her every day in the hopes she'd become accustomed to seeing me around but nope...   


Eventually, I just assumed to take it as a hint that she wasn't interested in me.   


Three months later, though, I needed help with a customer so I approached her directly for help. ''Excuse me, yes you. Sorry to bother you but would you know where this thing is?...''  


She instantly looked up and for the first time looked up at my face. And gladly helped me. And I thanked her and went on my way.   


Half an hour later, that same girl sought me out of her own volition and introduced herself to me. She thought I was 'new'. And straight-up asked me if it was my first day. No girl, you're just clueless and unaware as fuck. Fancy that... A girl I'd admired for over 8 months who had ignored me was convinced it was my first day at work and was VERY interested in me.

This sounded so surreal.. as you said in one of your comments, the majority of people are oblivious and unaware of the depth and darkness/evil our human experience can get here on Earth..

So I followed up on reading about your life story and have discovered some other of your earlier posts about your life.. the “family” photo post with yourself answering questions about it.. just reading and trying to comprehend it. It has shaken me to the core and it’s been on my mind and attention since.

I can’t even describe what I feel.. Your story and some of your words seem to resonate so deep within that they just leave me speechless. The paradox, the contrast of experiences you have had.. the strength of your soul. 

I am so truly sorry about your early experiences here on Earth..  but I’m also at awe at the strength of your soul. It made me so happy to read that you have finally escaped that hell and that you preserved the light and love despite the unimaginable darkness you have faced. I know you have raised a daughter who also gave you strength to carry on and not to give up.

You also seem to have the way with expressing yourself so eloquently, so clearly which can be so powerful for someone who have been to the depths of Hell and heights of Heaven.

I apologise as I’m very aware that I’m just rambling now and that many who are reading this they are probably very confused what am I talking about.

I haven’t read all of your posts yet but I understood that you are writing/wrote a book about your life.. please do let me know if or when it is going to be released.

"g5mmzde","honestly have been thinking more on this comment since it was made.

I never really expected to go to far into the back story of big papa, I knew how he ended up on the streets... but the after math... 

&amp;#x200B;

Big papa was born in a house with a family, but was born with bat wings. His parents chewed them off and hated him as the ""monstah babeh"", His siblings and parents were cast out of the house along with him when the people had to move and well... its easier without pets. One by one his folks were picked off... till he remained.

&amp;#x200B;

Him being a young and unaware of the streets fluff. I can fathom he had some hard times, trying to figure out ware to go how to go what to do so forth. I know he joined a herd after his folks and family died, And with no wings to mark him as a monster. He was taken in by the other. 

Booger and his brother Bow were the ""bestest"" bebehs of the leader of the herd. And given big papa's beginnings he was probably still considered small or weaker or dumber.

With some things that may have needed to happen, them using Big papa as a decoy or blaming him, eventually he got fed up. Got stronger and took over the herd and area. But due to his past with the brothers he May have had to teach them once or twice or a few times. 

You don't. Mess. With Big Blue.

"g5hda3d","&gt; Basically all right-libertarian arguments rely on the average person being far more well-off economically than they are... 

Nope. 

Right-libertarianism finds it roots in very old philosophy, so called ""Classical Liberalism"", when the median person (arguably the richest person as well) was objectively worse off than the poorest person is today. 

&gt; Both knowingly wealthy people and those who believe they’re “self-made”  assume everyone shares their background, and buy into libright crap as a  result. 

I don't even thinks this qualifies as a strawman, it is so blind I can only assume you have spent zero time around actual libertarians (vs twitter/reddit edge lords). 

&gt; Like, all that shit about private power being more ""voluntary"" that  state power relies on private power not being coercive in any way (as if  the options people have in order to financially support themselves  aren't limited by external factors beyond their own choices). 

No it doesn't. 

This is an external condition applied by opponents to libertarianism on what is pretty much the dictionary definition of ""voluntary"". Libertarians don't think we need to have some type of imaginary utopia where people can do anything &amp; everything they want with no restrictions placed on them by others or nature for something to be voluntary. That is silly nonsense. 

&gt; All the suggestions to work your way up the ladder of a good job depend  on getting hired at one, which 99% of the time is basically a birthright  as a result of connections. 

Obvious BS. 

&gt; In reality, the vast majority of Americans can't foot the bill for a  $500 emergency expense, are living paycheck to paycheck and can't afford  basics, make roughly $15-20k a year at best, are often deep in debt,  and can barely afford rent. 

Again, patent nonsense that no one who is able to read should believe. 

The median individual income is well over $30K (median household is over $60K). The famous 'Americans don't have $400 in savings!!!' stuff was based on 1 flawed study and is not reflective of reality (but even if true is a choice made by people to consume now rather than save). Housing is not actually that expensive in America as a whole, costs have gone up only slightly more than inflation. The problem is that in cities people made choices which were the *opposite* of libertarian and restricted building (especially low cost building options) which after a few decades has driven up the cost of housing in high density areas to crazy levels.

"g5dzki4","&gt; This is not ""abuse apologia"". My post is intended at recognising that people forget that James had redeeming qualities, just like Snape. 

This post is textbook abuse apologia and victim blaming, and even includes victim blaming and profiling *a 10 y.o. child* for half-heartedly pushing back against an older child who had repeatedly mocked his abject poverty. And the fact that the poor child's family was infamous in town, to the point that people from other neighbourhoods knew about them, shoud also make it clear just how bad the poverty was, and likely the extent of the abuse going on in the household. 

If you're not comfortable acknowledging what you wrote, maybe it's a sign you shouldn't have written it in the first place.

Your post also presents *zero* redeeming qualities James had, instead focusing on what a bad person James's main (but not only, which you completely gloss over) victim supposedly was. It's easy to forget something that never existed in the first place.

&gt; What I'm saying is that Snape abused/ took part in the abuse of others during his time at Hogwarts. That doesn't justify James's actions. But it is hypocritical to tout James as an irredeemable character because of that scene and Snape as a tragic antihero.

It's disgusting to compare Snape not alienating himself from the people he shared a bedroom with (and who also happened to be his social betters in every way, and had particular hatred for people of Snape's ascendancy) to James deriving genuine *pleasure* from tormenting other people and sexually assaulting them.

The hypocrisy is comparing Snape to James, when Snape was comparable, at most, to Lupin (except Lupin, being prefect, was officially tasked with stopping bullying, and didn't). James, on the other hand, is much worse than Draco, to the point that *his own son wants to vomit at his actions, and sincerely believes him capable of having raped and forced Lily into marriage*.

&gt; By your own logic, Snape must be a horrible person for being so abusive and humiliating a child who was already really insecure about his magical ability(Neville Longbottom). 

That sounds too dumb and unaware of context and literary tropes and conventions to be my logic. Snape was coded as a regular overbearing teacher, not an abuser, the same way Hagrid was coded as a good person despite him mutilating a child and violently threatening that child's powerless parents, threatening another child with torture, and so on.

In context, Snape, who studied under people like McGonagall, actually had a milder touch. After all, if McGonagall was still using corporal punishments in the 90s, when they had been outlawed already, she was probably caning students left and right in the 70s. In his turn, Snape doesn't lay a hand on his students, and is actually very careful of their safety, unlike teachers who are coded as good, and who repeatedly endanger children's lives without caring about it/even intentionally.

&gt; You saw the line about Mulciber and Avery, right? Doing creepy things to a girl using Dark Magic was Snape's idea of fun.

I think this might be a translation issue, perhaps. Something being ""just a laugh"" means it was done jokingly, and not with malice. In this case, it's blatantly obvious that Snape is not saying he thought it was great fun, he's trying to downplay the incident as a joke, not as something meant to inflict serious harm. Which it didn't, otherwise Lily would have mentioned it.

In any case, I'm unsettled that your mind immediately jumped to ""doing creepy things to a girl"". It was very likely Levicorpus, based on Lily ""almost smiling"" at seeing Snape being subjected to it (otherwise she's just that bad), Ron having the exact same line when Hermione criticises the spell, and so on.

Also, the Bat-Bogey Hex is Dark Magic, and James and Sirius canonically used illegal (so, the worst kind) of Dark Magic to torment people they were ganging up on.

So that but only proves that either Lily was a huge hypocrite, or that James hid his actions very well.

&gt; If James Potter's past is irredeemable, so is Snape's.

Only if someone is sick enough to equate an impoverished, underprivileged, and abused child trying to fit in with his bigoted peers, but still managing not to personally attack anyone, to an overprivileged sociopath who gets off on tormenting people, trying to force girls into dates, and sexually assaulting their friends.

&gt; but they went on to become better people

And there's the crux of the issue.

By the end of his character arc, Snape was willing to die to save as many people as possible, people he didn't even like, despite having the possibility to save himself. So he did become an insanely altruistic person, matched only by Harry himself (with the mention that Harry was groomed to sacrifice himself, and had no alternative).

There is zero evidence that James became a better person, or even felt a twinge of regret for having physically and sexually assaulted people.

At this point, I consider James a litmus test. He isn't even a character, he's background scenery for the relevant characters (Harry and Snape), and in all of his scenes he is portrayed as a bad person who, let me mention this again, gets off on shoving soap down people's throats and forcibly removing their underwear. If someone ""identifies"" with such a character, and feels the need to defend them and bash their victims...well.",1600196455,"that sounds too dumb and unaware of context and literary tropes and conventions to be my logic.","dumb and unaware","unaware","and",FALSE,"too dumb and unaware","dumb",NA,"too",0

"g5cpyhd","I think Celestials (and other Ancestral beings, like Cain) possess more power than they are aware of. Thus they unwittingly alter reality around them, but they don't even know exactly how or why they do it. Because of this lack of awareness, this power is triggered suconsciously, and once the change has been made, it stands unless they somehow come to a deeper understanding of their own mind and nature, resulting in the eventual ability to annul or modify said change.

"g4zxbo5","On November 13, 1930, over tea in the magnificent Cathay Hotel, Ursula met a woman who would change her life. Agnes Smedley was America’s most famous radical left-wing woman novelist, the acclaimed author of Daughter of Earth, a bestseller the previous year. Smedley never espoused a coherent philosophy, for hers was the politics of anger, a scattergun rage against the capitalists, mine owners, imperialists and colonisers who kept the poor, the non-white and the working class enslaved. She had no time for political theory: “Who cares if I read all that trash? I know who the enemy is, and that’s enough.”

Smedley supported communism without considering what communist rule involved in reality. She was passionate, prejudiced, charismatic, narcissistic, reckless, volatile, loveable, emotionally fragile and uncompromising. She considered sex degrading, but was an enthusiastic advocate and energetic exponent of free love. “Out here I’ve had chances to sleep with all colours and shapes,” she wrote to a friend, shortly before meeting Ursula. “One French gunrunner, short and round and bumpy; one 50-year-old monarchist German who believes in the dominating role of the penis in influencing women; one high Chinese official whose actions I’m ashamed to describe; one round left-wing Kuomintang man who was soft and slobbery.” Agnes was everything Ursula admired: feminist, anti-fascist, an enemy of imperialism and defender of the oppressed against the forces of capitalism, and a natural revolutionary.

She was also a spy, who had been recruited by Soviet intelligence in Berlin the previous year.

[Kuczynski in 1936](https://images2.imgbox.com/7b/14/aabootwm_o.jpg)

Ursula was five months pregnant, and unaware of her new friend’s covert activities. She did not know that Agnes’s handbag contained a loaded pistol. She knew only that she had found a sister of the heart.

Immediately after their first meeting, Agnes sent a message to Moscow requesting permission to arrange the recruitment of young Mrs Hamburger.

Three weeks later, Agnes told Ursula to expect a visit from someone she could “fully trust”. At the appointed hour, the butler announced that “Mr Richard Johnson” had arrived, and ushered in a man of about 35. Ursula was immediately struck by his extraordinary good looks: “A slender head, thick wavy hair, his face already deeply furrowed, his intense blue eyes framed by dark lashes, his mouth beautifully formed.” The stranger had a pronounced limp and a strong German accent. Three fingers of his left hand were missing. He radiated charm and danger.

His real name was Richard Sorge. He was Agnes Smedley’s principal partner in espionage and her current lover, the most senior Soviet spy in Shanghai, an adept seducer, and an officer of the Red Army intelligence service.

Ian Fleming once described Sorge as “the most formidable spy in history”. Despite being German, communist and approaching middle age, in 1930 Sorge bore a distinct resemblance to the fictional James Bond, not least for his looks, appetite for alcohol and prodigious, almost pathological womanising.

Years later, Ursula recalled her initiation into Soviet espionage.

Having received Ursula’s assurance that the house was empty save for the servants, Sorge carefully closed the door to the sitting room, and sat beside her on the sofa.

“I have heard that you are ready to support the Chinese comrades in their work?”

Ursula nodded eagerly.

“You can still refuse without anyone holding it against you.”

Implicit in Sorge’s question was a threat that if she opted to play her part now but attempted to back out in the future, it would be held against her in a way that might be very unpleasant indeed. She insisted she was ready.

Sorge smiled. Her contribution would be strictly logistical, he said. Her apartment would be used as a safehouse, where Sorge could conduct meetings with revolutionary comrades fighting the Chinese nationalist government. She would let the visitors in, provide refreshments, warn if anyone approached the house, and otherwise stay out of the way.

Ursula was now living a double life: one with Rudi, as the wife of a colonial official, dull, dutiful and comfortable; the other with Sorge, Smedley and their communist collaborators, a thrilling existence of secret meetings, comradeship and intellectual stimulation. Her husband knew nothing of her secret activities.

On February 12, 1931, Ursula gave birth to a boy: he was named Michael.

One of the first visitors was Richard Sorge. As she would throughout her life, Ursula felt the conflicting pull of espionage work and her maternal instincts, “partly embarrassed to be involved in such private matters as having babies, and partly proud of my little son”. Sorge brought flowers. “I led him to the baby’s crib,” Ursula wrote. “He bent over and gently pulled back the quilt with his hand. For a long time he looked at the infant in silence.”

From Sorge’s ruthlessly pragmatic perspective, little Michael was a complication, but potentially an asset. He was ideal cover. Who could possibly suspect that a first-time mother with a newborn baby might also be a spy?

[The railway bridge at Great Rollright – Kuczynski had a ‘dead drop’ site in the root of the fourth tree on the left beyond the bridge](https://images2.imgbox.com/fc/14/GHMHKCqO_o.jpg)

On a beautiful summer morning, when Michael was almost six months old, Ursula received a telephone call from Sorge, not to arrange another meeting, but with an altogether different proposition. “Would you like to go for a ride on my motorbike?”

Sorge was waiting for Ursula on the city outskirts, astride an enormous black Zündapp Flat-twin K500 motorcycle. He showed her how to put her feet into the footrests, and told her to hold on. Then they roared off, at breathtaking speed. Sorge was a fantastically reckless driver. Soon they were beyond the city limits and flying through the Chinese countryside, past paddy fields and villages, Ursula’s arms tightly wrapped around Sorge. “Thrilled by his breakneck driving, I urged him to go fast and faster.” Sorge accelerated, and the motorbike seemed to take off. Ursula was in a state of petrified ecstasy.

“When we stopped,” she later wrote, “I was a changed person. I laughed and romped about and talked non-stop.” Her anxieties seemed to evaporate. “Shanghai’s detested social life was forgotten, as were the constant pressures to conform to etiquette, the responsibilities of clandestine activities, and the unnecessary worries about my son… I was no longer afraid.” Many years later, she reflected: “Perhaps he had only arranged this ride to test my physical courage. If, however, he had been seeking a way to establish better contact between us, he had gone about it the right way. After this ride, I no longer felt inhibited.”

Sorge understood the seductive power of a fast motorbike. Ursula shared his love of risk. He was undoubtedly testing her, though in a way that was more emotional than physical. Exactly when Ursula Hamburger and Richard Sorge became lovers is still a matter of debate. Years later, when quizzed about her relationship with Sorge, Ursula replied obliquely: “I was not a nun.” Most sources suggest that their relationship ceased to be platonic soon after this exhilarating motorbike ride, and quite possibly somewhere in the Chinese countryside outside Shanghai that very afternoon.

A housewife-spy, Ursula had hitherto stood on the periphery of Sorge’s network, keeper of a safehouse, a discreet enabler. With their newfound intimacy she joined Sorge’s inner circle, a trusted lieutenant in the conspiracy, a partner and confidante.

In his messages to Moscow, Sorge allocated Ursula a codename: “Sonya”.

There was a song, popular in Shanghai’s nightclubs: “When Sonya is dancing to a Russian song, you can’t help falling in love with her… Even Vladimir is crazy about her, sets aside a glass of vodka, just to see Sonya...”

The codename carried a significance only Sorge and Ursula understood.

After training as a radio operator in Moscow, Ursula Kuczynski was deployed to Japanese-occupied Manchuria, with her young son in tow, to run the underground communist networks battling the Japanese with the help of another communist spy, a Lithuanian seaman named Johann Patra. When the communist network was betrayed, she was forced to flee, already pregnant with Patra’s child. In 1938 Agent Sonya returned to Moscow, where she was presented with the order of the Red Banner, and given another, even more dangerous assignment: with Europe plunging into war she was ordered to go to London, where her family had fled from Nazi persecution, and then move to neutral Switzerland and set up an espionage network inside Nazi Germany.",1599952429,"[kuczynski in 1936](https://images2.imgbox.com/7b/14/aabootwm_o.jpg)  ursula was five months pregnant, and unaware of her new friend’s covert activities.","pregnant, and unaware","unaware","and",TRUE,"pregnant , and unaware","pregnant",NA,NA,0

"g4v7cnh","Spirits start their lives inside small meteorites that fall in showers onto the world in events called ""skyfalls"" that happen every 5 years. While inside, the juvenile spirit is unconscious and unaware of their surroundings until it is broken open, which will allow the spirit to awaken.  
These meteorites are special as they're one of the very few materials spirits can physically touch, making them valuable both to spirits and mortals.  
No one knows where these meteorites originate from, but some spirits believe that they come from a massive reoccurring comet who they see as a god.   
    
Compared to human babies, juvenile spirits are much more active and are born with an intelligence about equal to a 10 year old child. They then reach full maturity at the next skyfall and are mentally equivalent to an adult human.  
While they're in this 5 year period of childhood, spirits can freely switch colors, but their powers are very weak at that point. The longer they stay with a color, the more adept they become with that color's powers.    
When the next skyfall happens, all of the previous generation will have their color locked, but most will have already devoted themselves to one already.
